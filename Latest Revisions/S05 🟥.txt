👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chronsega Episode 5 ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, here we are again with "Chronsega Episode 5" and we're going to check out all the Japanese Master System releases from December 1987 to early June 1988, as well as a few non-Japanese releases from 1988 as well. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And this is a real All Star episode as we'll see most of the big name franchises put in appearances. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though none of these sequels really turned out quite the way that I hoped. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yep, once again, Sega does not quite pull it off. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alright, let's get this one started! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Opa Opa 🇯🇵 // Fantasy Zone: The Maze 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Man oh man, that is one ugly title screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And sort of amateurish looking. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Definitely not a good sign. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, let's get the ball rolling with "Opa Opa". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Wait a second! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Fantasy Zone II..." came out two months before this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And now there's already another sequel? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, yes, but this is not your typical "Fantasy Zone" game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So far, it looks kinda like "Fantasy Zone". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, it turns out it's an old-fashioned maze game (the kind that were popular in the early '80s). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This seems like an odd decision on Sega's part. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the West, the title was changed to "Fantasy Zone: The Maze". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I suppose so folks would know exactly what they were getting. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, how do you play this? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, the dots are not really dots; they're coins. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you scroll up, you earn money (down the bottom left corner there). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The object (just like all these games) is to get all the coins and avoid the monsters. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Use the money to buy items. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The wings speed you up, for example; there's a laser. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And because this is 'Fantasy Zone' naturally the weapons are limited-use (very limited! - you can [only] fire them a few times). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And each time you purchase an item the price goes up next when you buy it. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also, very important: See that glowing, uh, red spot items energy touch the spot? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Every time you touch it, it will reset it and keep the new monsters from coming out for a little while. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Probably the best power-up is this thing right here which turns Opa Opa into a fiery red fireball and you can zoom around and kill anything you touch. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, it's also very expensive. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you've completed all three mazes, you move on to the next world, but you also get a Bonus Round where you can earn a few more coins. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You, sorta, have to do this in the dark here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, I foolishly missed out on that coin in the upper left. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, just like "Fantasy Zone II...", this wasn't strictly speaking an Arcade port, but instead an Arcade version came out, uh, later for the Sega System E (which was an Arcade machine based around the Master System, though the -- the Arcade game definitely looked a little better). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, compared to the other Arcade games Sega was putting out at this time, this is, you know, definitely not very impressive, graphically speaking. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, what can really be said about "Fantasy Zone: The Maze" (other than it's, sort of, a weird idea)? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I can [only] assume the 'Fantasy Zone' games were selling well and Sega wanted an end of the year "Fantasy Zone" game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Since they had just released "Fantasy Zone II...", they needed something totally different. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And this is, you know, hardly a terrible game, but, uh, it doesn't really seem, you know, like a "Fantasy Zone" game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I think Sega's guilty of diluting the brand just a bit here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately for 'Fantasy Zone' fans, the real sequel wouldn't come out till 1992. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it never got a U.S. release until it hit the Virtual Console in 2008. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess my final opinion of "Opa Opa" (or "Fantasy Zone: The Maze") is it's not exactly bad, but not really what I was hoping. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Games 🇯🇵 // Parlour Games 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Compile 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh boy! It's our last game of 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And this combines two obsessions of Japanese video games: women in bunny outfits and bingo. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's "Family Games" or "Parlour Games" or "Party Games" as it's called here - but who even uses the word 'parlor' anymore? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Personally, I think the name "Family Games" sounds a little less stilted. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, this was developed by Compile, it seems. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Maybe their work on "Lunar Pool" got them this job. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But this is actually the less interesting of the two Compile games we have today. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I should point out that "Family Games" for the most part is a well designed title. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Despite being, sort of, a boring game, it's clear a good deal of thought and work was put into it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We can tell by the fact there's so many damn options for each game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Up to four people can play. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And you can choose from four different pool games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The mechanics here are the now standard 'use the D-Pad to aim and the button to control the Power Meter'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though I will admit I'm not very impressed by the graphics used for the balls, those goofy looking numbers overlaid on top of them. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'd say my favorite of all the pool games we've seen so far is still "Lunar Pool". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, darts has even more options. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Aside from some obscure sounding variations on the game, you can choose the number of players, even the weight of the darts. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The controls are a little bit less obvious here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You hold down the button to charge the Power Meter, then release, and then hit it to let go of the dart. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The arrow above your head indicates the position of the dart when you release it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Releasing it too early like I'm doing here, we'll have the dart land too high. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm gonna say the darts is probably, uh, in my opinion, the best of the three games here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But I wonder why they couldn't come up with a second character for the computer player, or at least, you know, change the hair color or something like that. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The last game here is actually Bingo. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... This is more like a real game than just a bingo number generator like we've seen in the past, you can actually place bets. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's like a gambling variation on Bingo. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not sure why these things always have to have bingo on them. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, this is clearly not the most exciting game we'll be seeing this episode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, you know, it's definitely better than all those minigame collections that we've seen on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to 1988 ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 1988 is here at last. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I think in 1987, we saw about 35, 36 unique releases for the Master System. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And '88 is gonna have about the same number (Unlike the FamiCom where the number of releases just grows and grows each year). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 After this, the annual number of games released for the system will start dwindling into the early '90s, when the Master System suddenly has, like, a resurgence in Europe and Brazil. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, let's go ahead and get the ball rolling here. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Maze Walker 🇯🇵 // Maze Hunter 3-D 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 January 31 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sega kicks it into high gear in 1988 with two games in January. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's double the number of games released in January 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Who boy! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 First up is "Maze Walker", released in the West under the more aggressive name of "Maze Hunter 3-D". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, once again, this is a 3D game that uses the Master System's fancy electronic 3D Glasses. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, like all the other 3D games for the Master System, the game itself is not so hot and you would never play it if it weren't in 3D. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once again, this uses some sort of super quick flicker to achieve the effect. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can't really see the flicker in this video. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, unlike, uh, "FamiCom Grand Prix", I'm not going to encode this to capture the flicker because viewing it without the glasses and the flicker is just really really annoying and makes everything look all blurry. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, at times the video just happens to capture the right frames and you can, sorta, see it switch back and forth between these two separate images. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And oddly, this does give it a little bit of a 3D like effect. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you can, sort of, get, you know, a -- an idea of how this game uses like different planes. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game simply consists of you walking around a maze looking for exits. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sounds really exciting, huh? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, yeah, but it takes place in a city with all these huge tall skyscrapers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And when you exit one area, you will usually reemerge on a different floor. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, yeah, this probably does look [pretty] cool on -- in 3D. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's nothing too complex here, gameplay- wise. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Even your weapon is [pretty] basic; it's a metal bar. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yes, you go around to smacking aliens with a lead pipe. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's not very futuristic. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You think you would have like a ray gun or something. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess what it kinda boils down to is ya have the Master System with the actual 3D Glasses, try this game out. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If not, you'll probably wanna forget about it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Wonder Boy Monster World 🇯🇵 // Wonder Boy in Monster Land 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Wonderboy ♪ by The Kinks
👓🏮🍋 "...wonder? 🍇
👓🏮🍋 Wonder boy, some mother's son 🍇
👓🏮🍋 Life is full of work and plunder 🍇
👓🏮🍋 Easy..." 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 January 31 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Westone 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned earlier, "Chronsega ... 5" is star studded, featuring most of Sega's big franchises at the time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the most satisfying sequel on display here is "Wonder Boy in Monster Land" (or "Super Wonder Boy Monster World", as they call it in Japan). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The way they title these "Wonder Boy" games can be [pretty] confusing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One of the sequels this game appeared under both the names "Wonder Boy III" and "Monster World II". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the game that we call, in the U.S., "Wonder Boy in Monster World" (which is actually a very similar title to the Japanese title of this game) was, in Japan, called "Wonder Boy V: Monster World III". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We actually covered all the insane variations on the "Wonder Boy" titles back in "Chrontendo Episode 10". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, in the first game, Wonder Boy was some grass skirt wearing dude living on a tropical island. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, he's got a snazzy new haircut, carries weapons and armor, and lives in a medieval Fantasy type world with lots of castles, villages and shops that sell mead. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Wonder Boy can now collect money, my items, and even use magic. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The original Arcade game, "Wonder Boy in Monster Land", had you literally starting out almost naked, wearing just a pair of tighty whities (or maybe a diaper). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One irritating thing about "...Monster Land" was with [this] the, sort of, two large strips of real estate on the top and side were taken up by various meters, inventory slots, and so on. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One great thing about the Master System release is that all the necessary information is compressed on the very top of the screen, and the rest is actually on a separate inventory screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, it no longer feels like you're playing an ancient Computer game where half the screen is taken up by sidebars and borders and so on. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sega was also kind enough to give you a little leather tunic or something to start the game off with. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, "Wonder Boy" isn't forced to, you know, battle evil King Arthur-style. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Every so often, you encounter this old town. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can go into a bar and buy a drink (that is a hint). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... Something taken from very old-school R.P.G.s - as well as armor, shields, boots, and magic. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Your sword, however, gets upgraded whenever you fight certain bosses. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are some enemies like this little caveman guys with horns who shoot arrows at ya. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you get the shield arrows will bounce off. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, aside from your main goal of simply fighting the final boss and finishing the game, there's like a Side Quest, which starts on, uh, this area right here when you knock on an invisible door. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yep! There are multiple invisible doors in "...Monster Land", often leading to hidden shops. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Side Quest requires you to act as a courier to a few different shopkeepers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll get an item that'll help you make, uh -- help make the final boss battle a bit easier. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 First of this, find this Catherine chick.🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of the bosses that gives you a better sword. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Normally a boss, uh, will drop a key which is necessary to unlock a door leading to the next level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But occasionally they'll drop something else instead. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, aside from the hidden doors there're little secrets hidden everywhere (coins, extra time, shortcuts). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But there are a couple major issues with this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 First of all, the timer. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yes, there is a timer running while you're making your way through each level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 See that hourglass up there on the right corner? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 When that runs out, you lose some health. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's funny; several games this episode have timers in them. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But in this case, it doesn't really make much sense, simply because there are so many hidden items and secrets. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 When playing "...[Monster] Land" you really want more time to explore. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 When the timer runs out, you don't die but you do lose some health. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It doesn't sound that bad, but the timer runs out really quickly. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And your health doesn't automatically refill all the way after each level. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Some enemies will drop hearts, which gives you a little Health Refill. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And there's an item that you can buy that will revive you with full health when you die. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But you can [only] carry one of those at a time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 All of this combined means that keeping healthy can be [pretty] difficult - which leads to perhaps the biggest issue with "...Monster Land". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have one life and no continues - and you cannot save. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yes, you actually have to get through this in one sitting without dying. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, granted, this isn't exactly "...Zelda" when it comes to length, but I mean even "Castlevania" gave you a few lives. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Another thing about the game is the money. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Enemies will, uh, generally drop gold coins or even little gold bags. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... Which is good because there are a lot of armor upgrades and helpful items which are quite expensive. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, there are some enemies that don't drop coins or health; they drop harps and necklaces and whatnot. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, what do these do? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, they're worth points. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yes, despite being a console Platformer in 1988, uh, "Wonder Boy" as a score. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This makes sense for an Arcade game, but it really should've been dropped when [it was] redesigned for the Master System. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Considering that you can [pretty] much always use more hearts and gold in the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Having enemies drop worthless stuff really sucks. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, on the positive side, there's actually quite a bit of varieties in levels. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean the levels aren't nearly as cool as say, "Ghosts 'n' Goblins" but they do b... -- mix it up a bit more in the first "Wonder Boy" game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, while our Platformer have ice levels or fire levels, "...Monster Land" has both at the same time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Why doesn't the lava melt those ice bricks? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the graphics are [pretty] presentable. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, they're a step down from the Arcade game - or the P.C. Engine version, which we saw back in "Chronturbo Episode 1". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But since the characters and sprites were all changed in that version, I guess I'm gonna say this is, like, maybe the best or most definitive version out there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 By the way, here's one of the last stops on the Side Quest, you have to enter the shop, exit, and then re-enter. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And then the guy who is there will give you a special item. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I'm sure you've played lots [of] games [that] were[ pretty] fun except for one major bummer. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like, for example, in "God of War" when you were climbing out of Hades, and ya had to get past all those Roman columns with spinning knives. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And suddenly you went from, like, liking the game to absolutely hating it. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I had a similar moment in "...Monster Land". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The final level is like a giant castle - sort of like Bowser's castle, that you had to for th... -- that you have to follow a certain path or else you'll get stuck in a loop. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Which is [fantastic] because you lose life every time the hourglass runs out. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 At some point, you will encounter a moving platform that you have to jump on. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And then there's a sequence where you must jump back and forth between two moving platforms repeatedly in order to move a vertical passage. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Of course, if you don't jump just right, you'll, sort of, slip right through the edge of the platform and fall all the way back down and end up in a different part of the castle. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you then have to make your way back to the moving platform section again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And if you make it to the next floor and get off, um, you'll actually end up being looped around again to an earlier part of the castle. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, actually, what you have to [do is], sort of, keep jumping back [and] forth for several floors to get to the very top (like three or four screens worth of jumping). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, as a result, this part is extremely frustrating. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the action on my controller is a little worn down [or] something; I've never really noticed [it doing the same] thing before. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But this one section put up such a huge roadblock right before the end of the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I think it was done to make it much harder for guys in the arcade to get to the actual end. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Maybe you would have to like had to have purchased the best boots in order to get -- easily get through the section or something. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But after trying it multiple times with no luck, I said screw it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {I} ended up not finishing the game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, it's a game I mostly liked with a really wonky platforming sequence right at the very end may...-- maybe ya want to throw the game out the window. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, do I recommend "...Monster Land"? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess I'm not really sure. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Galactic Protector 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Wait a second, Opa-Opa? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We just had a 'Fantasy Zone' in December and now another one? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, this one's even more unusual than "Fantasy Zone: The Maze". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You know people say that Alex Kidd was Sega's mascot during the Master System years, but in reality, I think it was Opa-Opa. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just like Mario, they throw him in all these different games and even makes an appearance in "Zillion" and "Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the Master System didn't really have anything along the lines of genuine kusoge, but it did have some very odd games (like this one!). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, "Galactic Protector" is a Japan-[only] release uses the paddle controller (also called the Sports Pad). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it's, sort of, like an inside-out version of "Tempest". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You rotate around the planet shooting all various moons and smaller planets are in a collision course towards ya. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game is very simple (this is really, you know, just about it). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But you will be constantly entertained by the ridiculous faces the planets are always making. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, I'm sure nine tenths of the art budget on this thing went into designing those faces. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you defend, uh, Earth, Saturn, and Jupiter. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... And each planet has its own unique set of expressions. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really sure why Saturn and Jupiter need to be defended since they're uninhabited, but, you know, oh, well. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, I've mentioned this before, but someone at Sega must have some sort of serious apocalyptic obsession because this is the third Master System game with a very similar theme - defending the Earth from a never-ending barrage of deadly objects. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We had "Global Defense", "Missile Defense 3-D", and now this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you fail, you'll get to see the planet be destroyed, along with Opa-Opa himself, which is actually quite sad. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Space Harrier 3D 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 3D game #2 (two out of four): it's "Space Harrier 3-D". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, wait a second, they just took "Space Harrier" and converted it to 3D? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, actually no, they created a whole new "Space Harrier" game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though it uses the same engine as the original Master System "Space Harrier". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 If anything, "Space Harrier" 3 runs a little less smoothly than the first one. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, presumably the programmers learned a few lessons when porting, uh, the original "Space Harrier" since the on-screen action is a little bit cleaner-looking than the first game, I think. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There're, sort of, fewer gigantic fluttering sprites on the screen at once. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But speaking of flicker, uh, playing "Space Harrier 3-D" without the glasses is [pretty] much impossible, since it's very difficult to gauge location of enemies or enemy fire. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, just to make this video I, sort of, tried to, sort of, stay out of the way if I feel it was coming towards me. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It would be cool to actually be able to play this since it's essentially a little-known sequel "Space Harrier". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But here's the thing, there's a 2D Mode, but to access it, you have to beat the game in the 3D Mode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Note the, uh, completely redesigned bosses here.) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Why didn't Sega just include a 2D option on the menu? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "OutRun 3D" (which came out in 1989) had this option, so it's too bad. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still looks, sorta, like an interesting game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though, perhaps the lower frame rate makes it a little less playable. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... There's gonna be an official sequel to "Space Harrier" later in the year for the Mega Drive. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And after that (like so many other Sega franchises) "Space Harrier" was virtually dropped. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Aleste 🇯🇵 // Power Strike 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Compile 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's a nice burning ember effect they have upon the "Aleste" logo there. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You're probably thinking the Master System could really use a good original game this episode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Something like an 'Alex Kidd' or a 'Phantasy Star', and you're right! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess the closest we have at the moment is this one, "Aleste" known in the U.S. by generic sounding title, "Power Strike". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once again, this is developed by Compile. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But unlike "Family Games", this one is a Shoot-'em-Up (a genre which Compile specialized in). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Over in 'Chrontendo', we've already seen "Zanac" and "...Guardian Legend" from Compile. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The system's a little odd, you have your standard laser cannot type weapon [and] one special weapon. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In typical Compile fashion, you collect those little yellow 'P' icons to power up your regular laser, and number icons, eight of t... -- of them all together, each corresponding to a different special weapon. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Your default special weapon is number one. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But here's the thing: 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 All the special weapons (except number one) are [only] good for a limited time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 After a while it will just disappear. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the Master System "Aleste" is generally considered to be a port (the original appearing on the M.S.X. computer). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the Master System game, the M.S.X. version features the standard anime-style space pilot [and his] girlfriend on the box art and has these cutscenes that add a bit of story [and] drama. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (This, by the way, is an unofficial English language translation.) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the cutscenes are [pretty] nice! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 His girlfriend Yuri was injured by a dangerous vegetable computer. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And according to, uh, well this he gets [pretty] bad and he has to go crush them all. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also revealed that "Aleste" is the name of the ship. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Certainly a shame all this was left out of the Master System version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess maybe this was cut due to reasons [of] space? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Aleste" certainly had it much worse than "Metal Gear"; that's for sure. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the game itself was actually changed a bit as well. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The entire first level was -- was dropped off which is too bad, again, because it's actually quite cool looking. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We'll, uh, see it here in just a moment. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah and his name is Ray Wison. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Maybe they were thinking Ray Wilson? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, it takes place over like some kind of like city full of all these skyscrapers and the power-ups are on the -- the building rooftops. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's kinda cool so it's, uh, a bit of a disappointment this is actually not in the Master System game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Master System game basically starts you off at Level 2. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, there was a sequel developed, um, [only] on the M.S.X. 2 in 1989. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This game features an even longer opening cutscene and apparently a more involved storyline. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And actually much more interesting bosses. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is actually a [pretty] cool game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 After this there is something called "Aleste Gaiden". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And then there were more spin-offs and sequels for various consoles. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like there were Game Gear titles "MUSHA Aleste" "Robo Aleste" "Super Aleste" for the Super N.E.S.. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Even though the first two M.S.X. Games and the Master System game all feel sort of a bit similar, they all kinda resemble "Zanac" to a certain degree. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I guess we also have a question here how exactly should we pronounce the title of this game? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Is it Aleste or Aleste or Aleste? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'll just go ahead and call it Aleste. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So anyway back to the, uh, Master System version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, obviously compared to the M.S.X. Games these are kind, sort of, weak looking backgrounds. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is Level 2 of the M.S.X. game but Level 1 on the Master System. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... But they actually do get a little bit better. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, I'll start by saying the obvious. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Anyone who has ever played this, this game is hard. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In most Compile Shooters are hard. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But compared to the M.S.X. versions, there are really a lot of enemies [at the] very beginning. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes, you know, there are so many enemies surrounding you all shooting multiple bullets in every single direction. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You get kind of boxed in. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, this -- this special weapon gives you a certain amount of protection. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, um, I mean there are moments where it's really kind of hard to catch your breath. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now I should mention, levels are [pretty] long. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's [only] six and they tend [to] feature multiple bosses of the typical Compile sort - lots of gun ports that you need to blow up. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As expected getting killed will cause you to lose all your power-ups meaning you're [pretty] much screwed. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, your replacement power-ups are [pretty] common and extra lives get earned [pretty] frequently. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But still "Aleste" is-- well, it's, quite frankly, exhausting. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So relentless the way they send wave after wave of enemies fill the screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... So m... -- there's actually been a slowdown in the game, which is unusual for Compile since they were normally known for their abilities to, sort of, stretch the hardware beyond what it was normally capable of. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Maybe this slowdown was actually, sort of, a blessing in disguise. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 When I first played "Aleste" I didn't really care much for it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... I think I like it a bit better now but it's certainly not the most fun Shooter I've ever played. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The fact that you lose your Power-ups after a while can kind of get a bit hateful. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like when you, sort of, have your weapon completely powered up and it's the one that you like, and then oh, it just disappears after a while and ya have to, like, sort of find it again [and] power it up again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, I can certainly see how gamers might not like that. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But still it's better than just about every other Shooter on the Master System like maybe "Fantasy Zone".🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, definitely give it a shot. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 10 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alright, March is here and we have new 'Alex Kidd' game, "Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's been over a year since "...Miracle World" was released. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sega had put out that 'Alex Kidd' "B.M.X...." game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But is this the real sequel that we've been waiting for? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, sort of, but no, not really. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "... Lost Stars" is, in fact, a port of the very first 'Alex Kidd' game - a little-known Arcade game from 1986. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes, uh, called "Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars with Stella", since the second player controls this mysterious Stella (Alex's sister, I assume? She's never been heard from again.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade game was a cute colorful Platformer -, more or less than the "Super Mario..." mode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This isn't quite the Alex we know and love, the super badass who can smash rocks with his bare fists. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 No, this is a younger gentler Alex Kidd who cries like a baby when he runs into a puppy dog or a baby chick. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alex starts off [pretty] helpless in "...Lost Stars" (no shell core technique, here). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You spend most of your game and jumping over or avoiding enemies as it is traditional Japanese games. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The least threatening things in the world can kill you - Or rather drain some of your Life Bar. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Actually, it's not really clear whether that's a Life Bar or a timer. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It slowly drains as time goes by but it takes damage when you touch an enemy. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The manual calls it a Life Bar, I think, um, but the icons that refill it are labeled SC for seconds so whatever. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One of the power-ups you can get is the ability to fire off projectiles. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is [pretty] handy for some enemies, but I didn't really use it that often. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are a lot of flying or jumping enemies and it's usually easier just to go underneath these or jump over them rather than trying to shoot them. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The inclusion of a gun doesn't really turn this into "Contra", by any means. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And Opa-Opa makes his third appearance this episode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Is this his last appearance on a Master System game? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I actually think so. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, ya lose any ammo ya had leftover in the previous levels, so be careful. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And there are some oddball obstacles like the poking fingers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I don't know exactly what, sort of, factory this is but what could those things possibly be used for? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They make the game seem sorta dirty. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And speaking [of] dirty, this next level is the world of make believe. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Make believe? Like the last two levels were somehow realistic?) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is a deliberately weird and wacky level and features the greatest enemy found in any 'Alex Kidd' game - a naked guy who shoots skulls out his ass. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And no, you didn't just hallucinate that; there really is a naked guy shooting skulls out his ass in this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 What did parents think when they saw this? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, probably not too many parents saw this because - come on, who actually had a Master System? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 At this point, Tonka was handling the Master System in the U.S.. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Maybe they're the ones responsible for the truly ugly artwork on the box cover. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In fact, Alex Kidd games almost always had bad box heart for Western releases. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Too bad since by this time there's actually some decent art coming out on some of the Master System boxes. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Naturally we have the underwater level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Because using a snorkel, despite being in deep water. 🍇 

🟥🍪🍊🍓 No explanation as to how [he] breathes, but if Mario could breathe underwater then why not Alex Kidd? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Another great example of being able to simply barge right past a boss there as you saw a moment ago. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you're wondering the plot here there's some sort of evil fiend named Ziggurat who stole a number of stars out of the sky and Alex travels to Ziggurat's dimension in order to get them back. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Somehow this is accomplished by collecting miracle balls. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is actually kind of a cool sequence here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ya dodged the rolling boulder by jumping on a little balloon. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Playing the game now it's easy [to] see as this being kinda, like a dry run for "... Miracle World." 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Some of the concepts like, you know, traveling by air and sea were expanded in that game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "...Miracle World" obviously added some more complicated level design, there was vertical as well as horizontal scrolling. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the last level was a big complex castle; There's nothing like that here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This last level actually is a little bit disappointing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... It's just, sort of, a bunch of floating girders and platforms and whatnot. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The sixth level is also, sort of, lame. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It was supposed to be inside of a monster, but you probably wouldn't know that unless you actually, you know, read it in the manual. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, at this point in the game, I collected six of the miracle balls. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And Ziggurat is, sort of, like the last bad guy here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I assume maybe that's him right there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I forgot to mention Ziggurat's level is shaped like the Statue of Liberty. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "...Lost Stars" is probably the [only] Sega game we've seen that occasionally employs the 'wacky Japanese game design' where random objects are thrown around with no rhyme or reason. (You know kind of like Cho Aniki games). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 To this point, you've [only] collected half the stars, uh, (6 and there's 12 missing) so now what? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, actually the seven levels just repeat. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, we actually go back to a harder version of Level 1. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, that's kind of a lazy solution. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Basically you play the game twice. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, "...Lost Stars" is not really a bad game, but anyone expecting "Alex Kidd II" might be a bit disappointed. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 An actual "Alex Kidd" sequel would not come out 'til next year, and that would be on the Genesis. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But that is a story for another episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Argos no Juujiken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Salio 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Holy cow! It finally happened! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I don't know if you noticed it a second ago, but this game was published by Salio, not Sega. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yes, the Master System officially has a third-party publisher - though sort of a strange one. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This game is "Argos no Juujiken". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, despite the name change, this is really a rather straightforward port of "Argos no Senshi" (known in the West as "Rygar"). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, before we go any further let's clarify the relation between this and the well-known N.E.S. game, "Rygar". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The original "Rygar" (seen here) was Tecmo's most Arcade game from 1986 - a [pretty] cool game by 1986 side scrolling standards. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For a weapon ya had a giant deadly yo-yo called the disk armor. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can swing this up or to the front, to the back. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And when you got a particular power-up, you'd actually swing it, like, in a full 360 degree circle. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game was very hard - repetitive but was fun to play - mostly because we the-- the unusual weapon (a bit different than your typical Lance's or guns). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, in '87 Tecmo released a substantially altered port of "Rygar" to the FamiCom N.E.S.. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This was completely reworked as a more console-friendly game is really an entirely different game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, in 1988, the mysterious Salio releases "Rygar" with the Japanese names slightly altered (though it's clearly based on the Arcade version, not the N.E.S. one). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, despite the Master System's technical superiority of the FamiCom this version looks [pretty] much like doggy doo. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And surely intro screen with the sunset and swords is neat looking. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But after that it's kind of lame. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Virtually all the background detail is lost and your disk armour looks really terrible. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's not smoothly animated at all. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 At times, almost looks like you're shooting fireballs at enemies. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And enemies don't really do that thing where they sort of fly backwards while fading out we kill them. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In this version, they just disappear. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I think much of the enjoyment he got out of the original "Rygar" was swinging around that damn yo-yo. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And that doesn't really translate well into this port. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are some other details that are missing as well - like the stone icons [that] the power-ups are found in, or when ya [reach] the end of a level ya pick up, like, a -- and raise up a large sensor [and] enter a room with a statue, and then you exit to the next level. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Among the various things you will pick up are the power-ups [to let] ya swing your disk armor in a full circle or will allow ya to, like, kill enemies [when] you jump on them. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also important is an item that lets you continue when you've lost all your lives. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, the question arises, who were Salio, and how did they end up being the first third-party publisher for the Sega Master [System]? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In Japan they were the [only] third-party publisher. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, they [only] released two games {for} the system (uh, this and "Solomon's Key", which we'll see later this episode). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Both were Tecmo games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And then they [only] released one other game - a P.C. Engine title in 1989. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, were they really just Tecmo? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess it could be. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 No one seems [to] know [for] sure. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though, you know, I looked on the back [of] the box and noticed Salio's address is in Chiyoda district in Tokyo - the same area Tecmo is located in. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, were they somehow connected like a short-lived front for Tecmo (like Konami had Ultra)? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Did the owners of Salio have some sort of ties [to] Tecmo? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess we'll never know. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The word 'salio' means 'jump' in Latin, by the way. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The word 'sautee' is actually derived from 'salio'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, the failure of this game [to be] very good means [that] "Rygar" never really had a definitive home version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [If] you wanna play the original "Rygar", I would recommend the Arcade version. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Blade Eagle 🇯🇵 // Blade Eagle 3-D 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 26 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here we have another 3D game for the Sega Scope (as they called those 3D Glasses). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The single cool thing about "Blade Eagle" is its name, "Blade Eagle". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That sounds [pretty] badass, despite just being a variation on 'bald eagle'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I've noticed that Shoot-'em-Ups don't really seem to be Sega's [forte] (at least not standard Shoot-'em-Ups). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Satellite 7", "Astro Warrior", "TransBot"... The Master System is littered with dull Shoot-'em-Ups, so let's add another one to that list. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So far, they are much better at off-the-wall Shooters like "Fantasy Zone" or "Space Harrier". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Maze Walker", the appeal here is definitely due to the 3D effects. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If this were a regular 2D game, you wouldn't spend five minutes playing it. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Enemies come down, you shoot at 'em, ... 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 A slightly larger ship appears from time to time; I assume those are the bosses. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 {At} some point, I seem to have received a power-up, because I was able to shoot a bit faster later in the game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's not that there's anything wrong with this game; other than it just being plain dull. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Rescue Mission 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Before we finish up, let's take a quick look at some Western-[only] releases from 1988. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's not really clear when these things actually came out so we'll just pick some at random. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Rescue Mission" is a Light Gun Game with a military theme. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just like Nintendo, Sega gave the Light Gun a big push in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Rescue Mission" opens up with you receiving a rather lengthy briefing from your commanding officer (so lengthy the guy couldn't memorize it; he had to read a piece of paper). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Let me summarize this rather hairbrained scheme. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Some soldiers are pinned down by enemy forces. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The first rescue guys they sent didn't work out. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, now they're sending in three more guys, apparently medics to go in and fix everything. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, how you going to do this? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 With an old-fashioned railroad handcar - as somewhat hilariously depicted on the box art. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, let's take a look at that cover again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's one of my favorite Master System covers. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The guy's all, 'Go! Go! Go!', when there are mortars going off all around him, guys firing machine guns, ... 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I hate to be the one to tell you this, dude, but when they give you a hand car instead of a tank, the army does not really want you to live. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Naturally as an extremely slow and unarmored target, enemy soldiers decide to take you out. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, the object here is to shoot any enemies or any projectiles while the handcar makes its way around. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing not to do is to accidentally shoot the guys you're supposed to be rescuing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I wonder if the same folks who did "Gangster Town" also worked on this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Both games that are very similar winged and haloed spirit that floats up when someone gets killed. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I give "Rescue Mission" one thing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's a bit different than most Light Gun Games we've seen so far (most of which are in the first-person perspective and involve you shooting at criminals or animals that suddenly jump out at you). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you help a wounded soldier, you'll wanna to pick up the items you leave behind. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you pick up the helmet all subsequent items will kill any onscreen enemies. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Rescue Mission" does get [pretty] hard quickly. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 On the second level, the enemies will have jetpacks of all things and they send more projectiles towards you. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have three lives. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 What really happens is once one guy gets killed the second guy in that group of three takes over (sort of, like the Bandai "Lupiun the III" game). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though the thing that springs to mind is, 'Why don't the enemy soldiers simply kill the guys you plan to rescue?'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They are unarmed soldiers standing in plain view. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That would certainly put and end to your mission. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, if you have any tolerance for escort-style game, they're Light Gun Games give it a try. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's [pretty] decent {but} isn't quite the standard Light Gun Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Poseidon Wars 3-D 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And our next non-Japanese release is "Poseidon Wars...". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not sure if this title screen is brilliant or retarded. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Rockin' music, though! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, the country's in some sort of crisis, so you decide to enroll in the Naval Academy. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, it takes four years to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, how do, you know, the crisis won't even be over by then? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In video games, the setup is supposed to be, 'You're the best pilot there is. We're sending you to destroy the alien nation single-handedly.', not, 'We're gonna send you to an institute of higher learning with hundreds of other students and then send you out as an inexperienced junior officer.'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though I guess "Poseidon Wars..." is more realistic in that regard. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One interesting that you may have noticed there was you can choose the mission from the title screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You don't actually have to play them in order. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, part of the problem with these Sega Scope games, or the Light Gun Games, is they're mostly really very simple games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, this could be like a FamiCom game from few years ago. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Really, mostly just, sort of, shoot everything that comes at you - end of story. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The 3D effects essentially, were the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Without that there's really not that much to comment on. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nowadays, people often wonder, you know, why the Master System failed, and the Nintendo Entertainment System succeeded. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Part of it would have been that Nintendo wouldn't just put out a game, you know, quite this uninvolving. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, there's really, really not that much to it. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, there's just one more non-Japanese release game to go. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Reggie Jackson Baseball 🇺🇸 // American Baseball 🇬🇧 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 We've got one last non-Japanese release today, "Reggie Jackson Baseball" - the first Sega Sports Game we've seen since the 'Great Sports' series petered out in 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also, the first Sega Sports game that carry the name of a real-life sports star, Reggie Jackson, who is curiously depicted with blue eyes on the title screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Aside from that, the animated intro is very well done, and the speech samples sound great. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Reggie Jackson, for those of you too young to remember, was one of the great Baseball players of the '70s and one of the greatest batters of all time, and helped lead both the A's and the Yankees to five World Series wins. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the European version of the game, he was replaced with a generic clean chip and player and the game was retitled "American Baseball". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game begins with the usual play options, including the watch mode, so common on Japanese Sports Games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 When playing against the computer, you can choose both your team and the C.P.U.'s team. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 All the teams here are based on real Baseball teams, but all the team names of the team members are actually all fictional. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, as has been pointed out, the little pictures of the managers do resemble the actual real-life managers of those teams. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That guy looks like Billy Martin of the Yankees there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One interesting twist you have is whether you want the fielding to be automated or manual. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, this looks [pretty] much just like every other Baseball Game of its era (maybe a little nicer looking). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game has given a realistic graphical style. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The C.P.U.s pitches are usually all over the place, alternating between fast balls [and] slow balls [with lots of] wild pitches, so be careful! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, when ya get a hit in, the camera [will] travel [with] the ball, [and] sometimes some rather extreme perspective is used as the ball becomes huge when it's up in the air. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Right there for example. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the game does have a few eccentricities - uh, one of which I found out the hard way, while making the video. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have to manually move your existing runners, it appears. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like the guy on first just stands there; he doesn't run second base. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Normally your guys already on base would start moving automatically. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 On the cool side, whenever a batter gets hit by a pitch, a huge fight will breakout. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Mysteriously, the batter (who is shown being carried away on a stretcher) is actually fine a moment later then walks to first base. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Another bizarre theme is the cheerleaders. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can also see them near the dugouts during the game, as well as on this jumbotron between innings. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Do Baseball Games have cheerleaders in Japan? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You also sometimes see, sort of, dancing mascots on the jumbotron. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing: While I didn't really take the time to fully master this game or anything, I didn't have much luck with pitching. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can throw a fastball, slow balls, curveballs, but the C.P.U. seems to hit [pretty] much everything you throw. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Doesn't matter whether it's over the plate or to the side; the C.P.U. will almost always get a good hit in. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I think I got maybe one strikeout while playing this. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, "Reggie Jackson Baseball", despite being not very well remembered title, is a decent little game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If anything, it's known as being sort of a dry run for Sega's next Baseball Game, "Tommy Lasorda Baseball" which came out in 1989 (one of the earliest titles for the Genesis). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, I'd say the era of licensing in Baseball Games has definitely begun. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hoshi Wo Sagashite... 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 We enter April 1988 with "Hoshi wo Sagashite...", a Science Fiction Adventure Game released [only] in Japan. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I really don't know the best way [to] translate [that title]. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Looking for the Stars' maybe? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 [For] some reason, most {of} the Master System's Adventure Games never made it out [of] Japan. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [But] we do have an unofficial translation from Filler and Hungdongs' Sega translation. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, we can enjoy the exciting "...Story of Mio", as their translation is called. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game begins with the bored and horny protagonist, Roy, about to visit his girlfriend on her home planet. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have the standard "Portopia"-style menu with many of the same options that we've seen over and over. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's 'Move', 'Look', 'Talk' and so on. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And there's another one here, 'Eat'! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I've actually checked through a walkthrough. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it turns out you [only] need to use 'Eat' , uh, exactly once in the entire game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now the plot involves a rare alien creature, you inadvertently, uh, end up in possession of, called a Mio. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's really just a lion cub with wings. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You obtained the Mio egg from this egg dealer while looking for a gift for your girlfriend. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Why an egg would be considered be a good gift is beyond me. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, you might occasionally encounter some problems with the game's interface. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's not always clear how to do what you wanna do in order to move the story forward. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like here, for example. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It} seems likely you should buy an egg from this guy, but how? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you talk to him, he'll tell you to buy an egg. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 When I try to take an egg, he told me to knock it off. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's money in my inventory and option to use the money on an object. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 When you use the money on him, he doesn't give you an egg. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It turns out, you need to use the money on him and then take the pink egg specifically. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, a bit of trail and error is required to just buy an egg. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Of course, these kinds of issues were certainly not uncommon in earlier Adventure Games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I tried using the money on the eggs, but that didn't work either. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 When I use the money on him, he just asked me which egg I wanted. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Finally I managed to pick up the pink egg. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now the same thing occurs when you meet your girlfriend. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 She asks you to come inside but the move option doesn't have an option to go inside. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It turns I need to show her the egg in order to go inside. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Once again, not exactly intuitive.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, part of the fun in Adventure Game is, sort of, fooling around trying to do weird stuff. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They're actually limited options for such amusement here, as far as I can tell. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though, for example, looking at Lila's torso will make her embarrassed. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... And you can also end the game by doing stupid stuff like hitting the egg. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, how sad! You made her cry. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But still, this is not exactly a Sierra On-Line game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, it's not like you have to be in constant fear of dying or permanently screwing up the game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though some perfectly reasonable actions will also have negative consequences. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Lila recommends calling the newspaper for information about Mio eggs. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But if you do so that will result in authorities taking away the egg. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, "...Story of Mio" uses the, uh, very much, sort of, the "Portopia"-style of conversation. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The idea is to talk to people until a new location or person opens up. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Opting not to talk to N.P.C.s a few times repeatedly, because they dribble out information one sentence at a time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ask them about the same thing three or four times. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And finally they'll say, um, 'Oh, so and so has it and is on this planet.'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Then it's back to the airport and head to that planet. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Having to hit the talk button over and over again almost seems more like filler, than anything else. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Right now I'm trying to, sort of, uh, get some information out of this old lady here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Turns out one of the main dude you're looking for is named Chaos, oddly enough. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, this game looks [pretty] nice. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, as I mentioned, it's not always super intuitive. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the story (trying to care for a baby alien creature) isn't really that exciting. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, we haven't really seen a whole lot of these Japanese Adventure Games actually playable in English yet, so it's definitely, uh, something worth checking out. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Solomon no Kagi: Oujo Rihita no Namida 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo | Aisystem Tokyo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Salio 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Another Japan-[only] game here from Salio (the second and last Salio game for the Master System). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once again, it's one that's already turned up on the FamiCom, "Solomon no Kagi" or "Solomon's Key". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Rygar", it's a Tecmo game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, maybe you remember this game from 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But if not, you control a wizard named Dana. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yep, but the poor bastard's name is Dana. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, Dana can be a guy's name as well as the girl's name. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, Dana's trying to get through these, umteen gazillion levels of this temple. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is, sort of, a Puzzle Platformer type game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a look at the first level of the FamiCom version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's what we have here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's the same as the first level for the Master System! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, unlike "Rygar", the Master System release seems to be the same as the older FamiCom one. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, when we take a look at the original Arcade game, well, their first level is completely different. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, despite being two years old (and not exactly a cutting-edge game technologically), the Arcade "Solomon's Key" is the best-looking of the bunch. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Master System game really looks just like the FamiCom one but with brighter colors. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, it seems the Master System "Solomon no Kagi" was based on the FamiCom release and not the Arcade version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, it's exactly the opposite of ports of other Tecmo titles like "Rygar" or "Ninja Gaiden". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Makes me again wonder, uh, how Salio and Tecmo were connected. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, you were trying to get a hold of the key, which will unlock the door. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Your special wizard abilities are that you can jump up the height of one block. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And more impressively, you can make blocks appear and disappear with [your] little wand. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 By using the button in conjunction with a D-Pad you can point your wand at the block above you or below you (or, of course, the one directly across from you). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Only] the orange colored blocks can be destroyed. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 After the first few levels, here, more and more monsters start appearing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can collect, uh, various items hidden [in] the levels. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 ???'s one that'll allow ya [to] throw, feels, like, a limited number of fireballs. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (You [can] see the fireball icon up there in the upper right corner.) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This will kill a monster but this is really more of a Puzzle Game, [not] an Action Game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The main focus is -- is, sort of, on figuring ways to avoid the monsters, not shooting them. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It's} definitely a cool [little] game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... It's difficult to say [that] this was [better than] the version on the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But it's notable [as] being one of the few games on both systems. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tensai Bakabon 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 June 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Woo-hoo! We are at game number 16, so we're going into overtime! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, not really. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's just that this episode was gonna be a little bit short, so I added a couple games. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, this cute little animated opening intro here means we have reached June 1988 and "Tensai Bakabon". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... What about May you ask? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, there were no Master System games released in May. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Imagining that happen, nowadays! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 A flagship console going a month and a half without a single release? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, once again, we're in the Japan-[only] Adventure, uh, Game territory here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Tensai Bakabon' means 'Genius Bakabon'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it's from a very long-running manga and anime from Puccio Akasuka. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The main character is not really "Tensai Bakabon" himself, but this character, right here, Papa (Tensai Bakabon's wacky father). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, like I said, this is an Adventure Game put into the side-scrolling format. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 To be within your right status looks like a typical Action Platformer game when it first started up. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean you can jump and kick. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But really everything happens in these menus. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 When you encounter another character, the Action menu--menu will pop up with [only] three choices. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Talk', 'Hit', and 'Use'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Right here, I get to the liquor shop and, uh, try to buy some liquor. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The liquor store owner will beat you up because you don't have any money. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing I will say - the character artwork is very good. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The, uh, Master System is capable of delivering these colorful, clean-looking characters - something that is really not always been the case, you know, video games we've seen so far. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Think of the many manga-based FamiCom games where the in-game characters [only] vaguely resemble the original artwork. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And this guy right here, you can actually beat him up and, uh, take money from him. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 He's, sort of, I guess your--maybe your [only] source of money in this game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's even these little, sort of, mini platforming sections (sort of). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, you can drop down manholes to get in these little caves. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, despite the fact that these looks sort of like scenes from "...Mario Bros.", there's really no action here; you don't find any enemies or anything in the caves. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though, the game does get a bit weirder later on. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And there's actually a Shoot-'em-Up section where Bakabon goes into outer space. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, in that last cave sequence, Bakabon's name is written out in the rocks for some reason. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, "Tensai Bakabon" looks like a [pretty] simple menu-based Adventure Game with streamlined menus compared to most others. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The town is quite small; there's [only] maybe half a dozen buildings or so. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I think he's been [pretty] much the entire first half of the game exclusively in that one town running around talking to folks collecting items and so on. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, as far as such games go, this seems to be [pretty] basic. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Later on, another 'Bakabon' game would be released for the FamiCom by Namco and that one seems to be a bit more well-known. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kenseiden 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 June 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 We've got some awesome music going on here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is "Kenseiden" a game with a bit of a cult following. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You are, of course, similar with the [Belmont] clan from the 'Castlevania' games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But you might not have heard of Simon's cousin, Larry Belmont. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Larry was kicked in the head by a mule at a young age, severely hampering his vampire-slaying skills. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Thus, Larry cannot move faster than a slow jog and can [only] jump about one foot in the air. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In shame, he moves [to] Japan to study swordsmanship and changes his name to Hayato. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, while Samurais mostly carry two swords, in Hayato's case, they [ only] trust him with the wakizashi (the shorter sword). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That means [that] unlike other Belmonts with their long ass whips, Hayato [can't] kill anything with it, right a bit of space. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In other words, I was gonna have a tough time tracking down and killing the evil Warlock in this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, 'can save me' (or 'Sword Saint Legend' - a sword saint being a term for a great swordsman) is Sega's take on 'Castlevania' - [right] down [to] the [design of] the staircases, [reanimated] skeletons, flying heads, annoying [little] guys [that] jump at ya... - it's all in here! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is one of the probably few secret areas in the game; that gourd will refill [your] Life Bar. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... Sega did change up the structure [of] this game just a [bit] by adding some nonlinearity. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 After each boss battle (and this is -- that's the first boss battle, there) you'll be able to [exit] the area. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This [will] take ya [to] the main game map. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But [rather than just] moving on [to] the next area, you [have] a choice [on] several different adjacent areas. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here, I [could] travel to one of three provinces. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The areas, by the way, are all provinces of Japan, uh, and, uh, Edo is your final destination. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Part] of the [problem with] "Kenseiden", as I mentioned earlier, is that Hayato is just a bit of a wuss. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 To make matters worse, whenever he takes a [hit], he [gets] pushed back a couple steps. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 He's immune to damage for a split second, but in cases where there are multiple enemies on the screen at once, what will happen is he'll get hit, pushed back (into another enemy), and then getting hit and pushed back again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [It's] actually quite easy to end up being bounced back [and] forth between a group of enemies. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The whole 'bounce back' factor can be really annoying, especially when you're trying to avoid a [lot] of obstacles (like in those rockslide areas). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, Hayato does learn a couple tricks. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 After each box he'll get a scroll that teaches them a new ability. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The first is a better jump. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And after that since new sword techniques. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, certain provinces have these training challenges, like we're seeing here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you make your way all the way through the level without getting hit by an arrow or spear, your Life Bar would be lengthened. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though these are a bit tricky, as, you know, arrows tend to appear on screen and right before they touch you (have frequently wire in mid-jump). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And additionally a bit of backtracking is required. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, the training level that a dead end on the map which means I then have to turn around and replay the same level I just went through. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'd say considered as a [pretty] decent game (though it does obviously pale in comparison to the "Castlevania" games). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The level design is [pretty] uninteresting. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It tends toward the, uh, 'walk left to right' school of game design, with an occasional group of platform or flights of stairs. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the levels are repeated. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This one right here, for example, is just a clone on Level 2. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game feature of the Master System's, uh, usual eye-popping colors. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, other than that, it really isn't too exciting visually. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The backgrounds tend to be[ pretty] plain-looking. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though the bosses are, you know, nice and big and the music is really great. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, if you're looking for a decent "Castlevania" knock-off, I guess this will have to do - as long as you don't mind dealing with Hayato's general gimpiness. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 5 Wrap Up ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Chronsega Episode 6" is gonna be an interesting one. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The third-party developers finally come crashing through the gates with games by Taito, Technos Japan, Compile, Irem, [and] Data East all appearing. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 At the same time, however, after [only] three years, Sega begins winding down the Master System in Japan, as its successor console hits the shelves. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yep! Sega goes 16-bits in 1988. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But before that happens, we'll, of course, have a few more episodes of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇🍌
