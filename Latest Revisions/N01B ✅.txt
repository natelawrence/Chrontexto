👓🏮🍊🎇# 📽️ Chrontendo Title Sequence ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "UFO" ♪ by ESG


👓🏮🍊{Dr. Sparkle Presents}

👓🏮🍊"Chrontendo 🍋 EPISODE ONE 🍋 Version 2.0"🍌


👓🏮🍊Index ☰️, Transcript ⌨️, 🍋 + Captions ⏱ in English 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🍋 from Nate Lawrence 🏮🍌

👓🏮🍊Translated from English 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🍋 to __________ 🏁 by __________ ⬜🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 1 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hello, everyone, 🍊 Doctor Sparkle, here, and welcome to 🍋 "Chrontendo Episode 1, the Revised Edition". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Now, what's this?', you say, 🍋 'Revised Edition?'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, yes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Back in 2007, when I did the very 🍋 first episode of 'Chrontendo', 🍊 I wasn't really satisfied with the results 🍋 (especially concerning the sound) 🍊 so I've gone ahead and basically 🍋 re-recorded "Chrontendo Episode 1". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's basically just a newer improved 🍋 version of that same original episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎆 Introduction to Chrontendo ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 For those of you just now tuning in, 🍋 'Chrontendo' is an attempt to play 🍊 every single game released for the 🍋 Nintendo Entertainment System 🍊 (or the FamiCom, as it was called in 🍋 Japan) and we'll be playing all these 🍊 (rather than just looking at them) 🍋 in chronological order. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This will hopefully allow us to learn 🍋 something about one of the most beloved 🍊 video game consoles of all time, 🍋 as well as a bit about the history 🍊 of Nintendo and, sort of, video 🍋 game development in general. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But first, let's start off 🍋 by taking a brief look 🍊 at the history of 🍋 Nintendo, themselves. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 History of Nintendo ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo was actually founded, 🍋 way back in 1889, in Kyoto. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The original purpose of the company 🍋 was to produce Hanafuda EX 🎴, 🍊 which is a sort of Japanese playing card. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Over the years, they diversified a bit; 🍊 they came out with western 🍋 styles of playing cards 🍊 and tried their hands at other things, 🍋 like a taxi company and a chain of hotels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, really, for the first half 🍋 of the 20th century, 🍊 Nintendo was primarily 🍋 a card manufacturer. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably the most significant person 🍋 in the history of Nintendo 🍊 was Hiroshi Yamauchi 🍋 (the grandson of the original founder). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When he took over the company in 1956, 🍊 that's really when Mint... -- Nintendo 🍋 began to change its focus. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One figure who was instrumental in 🍋 this massive change was Gunpei Yokoi. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He designed an enormously 🍋 popular toy, called the Ultra Hand. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After the success of the Ultra Hand, 🍋 Nintendo sort of switched its focus, 🍊 [and] wants to become a toy company. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yokoi, himself, designed 🍋 many of these early toys, 🍊 including some very early 🍋 versions of Nintendo light guns. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo also moved on into electronics 🍊 and, by the end of the '70s, had 🍋 moved into the arcade video game field. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As was standard practice, 🍋 most [of] their earlier Arcade games 🍊 were very derivative of other 🍋 Arcade hits, such as "Space Invaders". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, all this changed, mostly due to 🍋 a young man named Shigeru Miyamoto. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Miyamoto would eventually become 🍋 Nintendo's preeminent personality 🍊 and game designer 🍊 (and one of the most influential 🍋 figures in the history of video gaming). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 His career took off when he was called 🍋 in to design a video game that could 🍊 be converted from unsold copies 🍋 of a game called "Radar Scope". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Depending on whom you ask, 🍋 "Radar Scope" was either an 🍊 enormous hit in Japan that 🍋 failed to sell any copies in the U.S., 🍊 or was just an overall flop. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Either way, Nintendo of America 🍋 had a whole bunch of these things 🍊 sitting in their warehouse and 🍋 they requested a conversion kit, 🍊 so these could [get] changed 🍋 into a different new game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The resulting game, "Donkey Kong", 🍋 was released to arcades in 1981, 🍊 and was a huge hit in 🍋 both the U.S. and Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was unlike any other game 🍋 on the market and created 🍊 the vogue for what we 🍋 now call platform games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo followed up "Donkey Kong" 🍋 with more Arcade hits, 🍊 like "Donkey Kong Jr." and "Popeye". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for a while, 🍊 Nintendo had also been interested in 🍋 getting into the home console market. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They had released 🍋 some "Pong" clones, 🍊 under the name "T.V. Game", 🍋 in the late '70s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And shortly thereafter, 🍊 a series of handheld L.E.D. games, 🍋 designed by Gunpei Yokoi, hit the market. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yokoi would eventually design 🍋 something called the Game Boy, 🍊 but Game & Watch was 🍋 the first entry for Nintendo 🍊 into the world of portable gaming. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 Introduction to the FamiCom ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Finally, in 1983, Nintendo ve... -- unveiled 🍋 its cartridge-based console: 🍊 the Family Computer 🍋 (or the FamiCom, for short). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A few years later, it would be released 🍋 in the U.S. (in a re-designed form) as 🍊 the Nintendo Entertainment System. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Japanese FamiCom has a rather 🍋 eye-catching red and white color scheme 🍊 as well as two controllers that are 🍋 actually hard-wired into the console. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, back in 1983, the FamiCom 🍋 was {a} [pretty] sophisticated system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It featured an 8-bit processor, 🍋 2 kilobytes of RAM, 🍊 and could display 16 colors 🍋 and 64 sprites on the screen at one time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Japanese home video game market 🍋 was [pretty] much untapped at this point, 🍊 and the FamiCom was an instant success. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to 1983 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's start back in the glorious 🍋 year of 1983, on July 15th. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The FamiCom debuted that day, 🍋 with three games as launch titles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like most new systems, releases for the 🍋 FamiCom came [pretty] slowly at first. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were a total of nine 🍋 games released in 1983. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And a quick word about 🍋 the FamiCom cartridges: 🍊 The FamiCom games are a 🍋 completely different size and shape 🍊 than the U.S. 🍋 Nintendo Entertainment System carts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, they're sort of short 🍋 and squat and fit snugly into the 🍊 FamiCom game boxes (which tend to 🍋 sort of be longer than they are tall). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, well, let's get going. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Donkey Kong 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1983 July 15 🇯🇵 // 1986 June [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here it is! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The very first game for 🍋 the Nintendo FamiCom: 🍊 a port of their Arcade game, 🍋 "Donkey Kong". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was one of three 🍋 launch titles for the system. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Note the sorta weird music 🍋 playing during the title screen, 🍊 and this even has, sorta, 🍋 like, an attract mode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you don't touch anything, you'll start 🍋 seeing a little demo of the game playing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's almost like Nintendo thinks it's 🍋 making an Arcade game, somehow. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once ya press a button, the actual 🍋 game will start, and then you'll find 🍊 you're playing an extremely accurate 🍋 and convincing port of "Donkey Kong". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm going to assume that, perhaps 🍋 the major selling point of the FamiCom, 🍊 when it first came out was, 🍊 'Hey! You can play games like 🍋 "Donkey Kong" and "Donkey Kong Jr.", 🍊 at home and it's just like 🍋 playing the arcade version.'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This certainly makes sense. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you think about it, 🍋 two of the biggest selling titles 🍊 for the Atari 2600 were ports of 🍋 "Space Invaders" and "Pac-Man". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The original "Donkey Kong", designed by 🍋 Shigeru Miyamoto, hit arcades in 1981. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Am I the [only] guy who's ever 🍋 been bothered by the fact that 🍊 Donkey Kong looks completely different, 🍋 on the 'How High Can You Get?' screen? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, doing a side by side comparison 🍋 (here's the FamiCom version again) 🍊 you'll see just how close this thing was. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There were, [of] course, a few compromises. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example (I assume to save space) 🍋 the little, sort of, introductory sequence 🍊 with Donkey Kong climbing the building 🍋 has been cut and an entire level 🍊 (the so-called Pie Factory) 🍋 has been removed, as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But still, this must have astonished 🍋 gamers when they first saw it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As a point of comparison, 🍋 let's take a look at some of the 🍊 earlier home versions of "Donkey Kong". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, for example, is 🍋 the old [Atari], uh, 2600 🍊 (really not that old; it came out in 1982) 🍊 but it's [only] a rough approximation 🍋 of the actual "Donkey Kong" game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The ColecoVision "Donkey Kong", 🍋 by contrast, was [a] 🍊 major selling point for the console. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was considered near-miraculous 🍋 in its fidelity to the Arcade game, 🍊 even though, certainly, 🍋 there are some differences 🍊 (like the fact that [the] little barrels 🍋 don't explode when you hit 'em 🍊 with the, uh, hammer). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm going to assume that everyone 🍋 out there more or less knows 🍊 how to play "Donkey Kong". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You control Mario (or Jumpman, as 🍋 he was called in the original version). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya need to climb to the top of these 🍋 various levels, avoiding things like 🍊 barrels and, uh, other things 🍋 Donkey Kong throws at you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's the final level, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You gotta remove all those rivets 🍋 that are holding the platforms in place, 🍊 which will cause Donkey Kong 🍋 to fall on his head. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In terms of historical importance, 🍋 "Donkey Kong" was: the first platform game, 🍊 the game that sort of brought 🍋 Nintendo to America, 🍊 [and] the game that introduced 🍋 both Donkey Kong and Mario. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya might say that virtually all of 🍋 Nintendo's later successes were, sort of, 🍊 built on the foundation of "Donkey Kong". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, this is a [pretty] auspicious 🍋 start for the FamiCom! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Donkey Kong Jr. 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1983 July 15 🇯🇵 // 1986 June [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, naturally, the second game 🍋 to [be] released for the FamiCom 🍊 (once again, a launch title) 🍋 was "Donkey Kong Jr.", 🍊 the 1982 sequel to the 🍋 original "Donkey Kong". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As before, we have sort of that, sort of, 🍋 generic-looking title screen and, 🍊 like a little arcade-style demo mode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Donkey Kong [Jr.]" was perhaps 🍋 a bit harder [than] the first game 🍊 (certainly had a bit more 🍋 variety in the type of play). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing to remember: this 🍋 was actually a [pretty] new game; 🍊 it hit arcades in 1982. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's take a look at the 🍋 original arcade version, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Mario has captured Donkey Kong 🍋 and is keeping him in a cage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The main question here is, 🍋 "Who is the second Mario? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Is that Luigi, dressed in red?" 🍋 (always been [a] bit of a mystery). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game portrays Mario 🍋 as a whip-wielding villain, 🍊 sending all these weird little 🍋 creatures after Donkey Kong Jr. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Something else you 🍋 may have wondered is, 🍊 "What, exactly, is 🍋 Donkey Kong Jr. wearing?". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's got some little, 🍋 kind of, white outfit on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's odd that a monkey 🍋 would be wearing clothing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned, "Donkey Kong Jr." 🍋 is kind of a tough game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Falling more than about 🍋 one centimeter will kill you 🍊 and there's various things 🍋 that will fall on you or hit you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The gameplay has been changed a bit, 🍋 from the original "Donkey Kong". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's still some running and jumping, 🍋 but the game is also, sort of, 🍊 based around the mechanics 🍋 of climbing ropes or chains. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All the climbing actually reminds me 🍋 of the various vines and whatnot 🍊 you would find in 'Super Mario' games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like "Donkey Kong", there were 🍋 some cuts made to the home version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The little introductory 🍋 sequences are not there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You don't get to see Mario, uh, 🍋 pulling up Donkey Kong in the cage, 🍊 while some Bach organ music plays. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's interesting to note that, 🍋 while "Donkey Kong Jr." was 🍊 a [pretty] big Arcade hit, Nintendo's 🍋 future was a little shaky, at this point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were currently in the middle 🍋 of a lawsuit with Universal, 🍊 over the use of 'Donkey Kong'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Universal was claiming that 🍋 this was based on "King Kong" 🍊 which, supposedly, 🍋 they had the copyright to. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They sued Nintendo, 🍋 gave them a cease and desist order, 🍊 and this was not resolved until 1984. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (I think the appeals 🍋 actually dragged on 'til 1986.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo won and got 🍋 some damages from Universal. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so going back to the game, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We're about at the final level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is it, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It involves climbing chains and 🍋 pushing keys up into the locks, there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This will free Donkey Kong 🍋 and send Mario tumbling. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After this, the levels will just repeat 🍋 (just like in "Donkey Kong"). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah! Evil Mario has been defeated. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hopefully this is the last 🍋 we'll ever hear [of] that guy. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Popeye 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1983 July 15 🇯🇵 // 1986 June [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, the third and final launch title 🍋 for the FamiCom was "Popeye" 🍊 (yet another port of a 1982 🍋 Nintendo Arcade game - 🍊 this one, perhaps not quite so successful 🍋 as "Donkey Kong" or "Donkey Kong Jr.", 🍊 but I certainly remember seeing it quite 🍋 a bit in the arcades, back in the day). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All these games have 🍋 very similar title screens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo sort of was aiming for, like, some 🍋 kind of consistency across their releases, 🍊 with the virtually identical title screens, 🍋 the little music, very similar box art... 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once again, the Arcade game was 🍋 designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He originally wanted to make a, uh, 🍋 "Donkey Kong", based on 'Popeye', 🍊 but couldn't get the rights. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you look at the intro here, you'll notice 🍋 you'll see little things like, uh, word balloons, 🍊 and a -- a bit more of a 🍋 little story being told 🍊 [between] Popeye and Bluto 🍋 and Olive Oyl. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the FamiCom 🍋 version couldn't quite capture this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Popeye" is definitely the best looking 🍋 of the three Arcade games that are 🍊 on display, here, and the FamiCom 🍋 wasn't quite able to capture this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As we can see, 🍋 the visuals take a bit of a hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is not quite the accurate port that 🍋 "Donkey Kong" (and "Donkey Kong Jr.") was. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object, here, is to catch all 🍋 the various objects that Olive Oyl 🍊 throws at ya, while avoiding Bluto. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There is a spinach that'll 🍋 appear, once per level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If ya grab that, you can then knock Bluto 🍋 out and send him crashing into the ocean. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This'll buy you a few 🍋 moments of extra time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, you can't let 🍋 the objects fall into the 🍊 ocean now and get wet; 🍋 otherwise, you'll lose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later levels get a bit more difficult 🍋 (three levels altogether). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One interesting little footnote: 🍊 "Popeye", along with "Donkey Kong" 🍋 and a few other titles, 🍊 were supposedly co-developed by 🍋 a Japanese [electronics] company 🍊 called Ikegami Tsushinki. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They apparently did some of 🍋 the coding for this game and, 🍊 when Nintendo proceeded to 🍋 duplicate this code, Ikegami sued them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The lawsuit was not resolved until 1989. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, with "Popeye", that wraps up 🍋 the launch [of] the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's now fast forward to August 1983, 🍋 for the first original titles for the system. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gomoku Narabe Renju 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1983 August 27 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, Nintendo, so you just released 🍋 ports of your three big Arcade hits 🍊 for your new console; 🍋 what are you gonna do next? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, like video game publishers, 🍋 everywhere, you release some 🍊 versions of non-copyrighted board games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, it's "Gomoku Narabe Renju". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Gomoku' is actually a [pretty] simple 🍋 little game that's actually played 🍊 on a 'Go' board, using 'Go' pieces, but 🍋 it's much simpler than the game, 'Go'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The object, here, is that black and white 🍋 take turns putting down pieces 🍊 and you're gonna -- gonna 🍋 try to get five pieces in a row. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The rules are that black goes first. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there is sort of a catch. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It turns out that, if black 🍋 goes first, they can always win. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Therefore, this is actually a 🍋 variation of 'Gomoku', called 'Renju'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is 'Gomoku', with a few extra 🍋 rules and restrictions in place, 🍊 that prevent whoever goes first 🍋 from always winning. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Gomoku' (just like 'Go') 🍋 is an old Chinese game, 🍊 but the name 'Gomoku' is Japanese. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It means something like 🍋 "Five Pieces Line Up". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're a kid that grew up in the U.S., 🍊 you'll probably think this game 🍋 looks a lot like 'Connect Four'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a few different 🍋 options on this cart. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can play against the computer or 🍋 you can play against another person. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm playin' against the computer, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, you know, it turns out I'm actually 🍋 not a very good 'Gomoku' player. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's funny; I would always 🍋 beat my cousin at 'Connect Four'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 ([I] guess the computer's a 🍋 bit smarter than my cousin). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game does give you little hints, 🍋 like when the computer's about to 🍊 get five in a row 🍋 their pieces will start flashing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the first three games we saw 🍋 were all released in the U.S. for the 🍊 Nintendo Entertainment System, 🍋 in 1985, but "Gomoku Narabe..." is 🍊 the first Japan-[only] title 🍋 for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, when Nintendo of America 🍋 was picking out potential releases 🍊 for U.S. release, 🍋 they decided to pass this one over. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is something we'll see 🍋 a lot of in 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Certain games will have, sorta, like, 🍋 a universal appeal, like "Donkey Kong", 🍊 and certain games, Nintendo decides 🍊 simply [only] the Japanese 🍋 would be interested in playing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course game fans and 🍋 publishers often disagree, as to 🍊 what games they would like to play, 🍋 leading to a lot [of] frustration 🍊 in the United States and Europe, 🍋 over all the great games released 🍊 in Japan, but not over here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 With this one, though, I don't really 🍋 think that we're missing that much. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sure, this is a fun little game to play, 🍋 but nothing too spectacular. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mahjong 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1983 August 27 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Released the same day as 🍋 "Gomoku Narabe", is "Mahjong"! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you're like most westerners, 🍋 you've probably never actually 🍊 played the game of 'Mahjong'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You may have played that game 🍋 that comes on Windows computers, 🍊 but that's not the actual 🍋 game of 'Mahjong'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's just sort of a matching game 🍋 that, uh, uses the 'Mahjong' tiles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's been released under various 🍋 names over the years, such as 🍊 "Shanghai" or "Solitaire Mahjong". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Mahjong' is sort of like a card game, 🍋 [only] instead of being played with cards, 🍊 it's played with small painted tiles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are several [suits]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, here, you see I have 🍋 quite a few of the, uh, Bamboo [suit]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Other [suits] have a series of dots 🍋 on them or Chinese characters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is not the first 🍋 'Mahjong' video game; 🍊 'Mahjong' games were among the 🍋 very first video games made in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, here's 🍋 "Royal Mahjong", from Nichibutsu, 🍊 originally released back in 1981. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In real life, 'Mahjong' is 🍋 normally played with four people. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, since the 🍋 advent of computer games, 🍊 a certain, sort of, special variation 🍋 on 'Mahjong' has emerged, 🍊 in which you play one-on-one 🍋 head-to-head with the computer. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the odds are that you 🍋 probably don't play 'Mahjong' 🍊 and I certainly don't play 'Mahjong' 🍋 (seems like here in the United States, 🍊 the [only] folks who play it 🍋 are little old Jewish ladies) 🍊 so I can't really tell you too 🍋 much about whether this is 🍊 a good version of the game or not. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose it looks decent. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, in Asia, 'Mahjong' 🍋 video games are enormously popular, 🍊 so it's not too surprising that one of 🍋 the very first games Nintendo released 🍊 for the FamiCom was, 🍋 in fact, a 'Mahjong' game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It certainly paid off for Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was one of the biggest selling titles, 🍋 over the entire system's lifespan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, I should point out that, 🍋 over the course of 'Chrontendo', 🍊 we'll be seeing many many 🍋 more 'Mahjong' games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mario Bros. 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1983 September 09 🇯🇵 // 1986 June [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, hot on the heels of Mahjong 🍋 comes "Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No, no; not that game - 🍋 the original "Mario Bros.". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is notable for a lot [of] reasons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's the first game where Mario sorta 🍋 steps out of the shadows of "Donkey Kong" 🍊 (also notable for being the first 🍋 game where Luigi is introduced). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A few recurring themes in the Mario 🍋 series sort of make their debut, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once again, "Mario Bros." is a port... but it's actually a port 🍋 of a [pretty] recent title! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The arcade "Mario Bros." came out in 1983 🍋 (same year as this FamiCom version). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The FamiCom couldn't quite, 🍋 apparently, replicate that 🍊 rather fancy little 🍋 title screen there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Much like the 'Donkey Kong' 🍋 games and "Popeye", 🍊 "Mario Bros." is a 🍋 [pretty] good-looking port. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, the colors are a bit 🍋 more brighter, in the arcade version, 🍊 there's a bit more detail, but, uh, 🍋 compared to what we've been seeing, well... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, for example, is the 🍋 Atari 2600 port of "Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This came out in 1983 as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, while this is clearly "Mario Bros.", 🍋 it's certainly been compromised quite a bit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So what's goin' on here? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, back in "Donkey Kong", 🍋 Mario was apparently a carpenter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now he's gotten a new job 🍋 as a plumber 🍊 and there's some sort of major 🍋 plumbing emergency going on, 🍊 with all kinds of turtles and crabs 🍋 and fireballs coming out of the pipes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Mario's job? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, rather than to fix the plumbing, 🍋 better kill all the animals that're comin' out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, here's a bonus level here 🍋 where the object [is] to collect coins 🍊 (the coins being one of the things 🍋 that sort of debuted in this game, 🍊 along with Luigi, as seen here, 🍋 and, of course, the koopas, 🍊 which in this game are actually 🍋 called "shell creepers"). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Mario Bros." is a collaboration 🍋 between Shigeru Miyamoto 🍊 and Gunpei Yokoi. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently Yokoi came up [with] 🍋 some [of] the basic design ideas 🍊 like, uh, having multiple levels, here 🍊 (and, of course, Mario not dying 🍋 if he falls off one of the platforms). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, in comparison 🍋 to the later Mario games, 🍊 the jumping mechanics 🍋 are actually quite primitive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once in mid-air, 🍋 you cannot control your jump at all. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, "Mario Bros." was the last 🍋 of Nintendo's big Arcade hits 🍊 that were ported to the system, 🍋 which raises the obvious question, 🍊 "What were they gonna do next?". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Popeye no Eigo Asobi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1983 November 22 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, let's set the stage, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's late November 1983, 🍊 there hasn't been a new game released 🍋 for the FamiCom in two and a half months, 🍊 Nintendo has already ported 🍋 all its big Arcade hits to the system... 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 What are they gonna do now? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Start porting stuff like "Radar Scope"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They can't exactly ask Miyamoto to 🍋 crank out a new game every two weeks, 🍊 but, still, they have to have something 🍋 on this new console, don't they? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, the solution is obvious! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just rip some of the sprites 🍋 from one of their existing titles 🍊 and make [a] brand new game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Because, of course, 🍋 this is a Family Computer 🍊 (it's supposed to be good for kids, 🍋 not turn their brains into mush) 🍊 it's gonna be an educational game, 🍋 this time starring Popeye. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, as a result, we get 🍋 "Popeye no Eigo Asobi". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, if you don't 🍋 remember this game from 🍊 when you were a young 🍋 person, that's because 🍊 it was [only] released in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a game that's supposed to teach 🍋 Japanese kids English alphabet and words. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You start by choosing a category 🍋 and then a word will come up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then Popeye runs around 🍋 and selects the correct letters 🍊 (shows you the word in Japanese and 🍋 you have to translate it into English). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every time he gets a letter wrong, 🍋 Bluto will punch the punching bag 🍊 and knock Swee'Pea a little bit 🍋 closer to the, uh, edge, there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I love the, uh, charming 🍋 little skulls that appear, 🍊 whenever you choose 🍋 the wrong letter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nowadays, I think that the suggestion 🍋 of harming an infant in such a fashion 🍊 might be considered a bit 🍋 taboo for games, but, uh, 🍊 let's [see] what actually happens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Will Swee'Pea actually drown? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh! Thank goodness! 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 Saved... just in time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a few different 🍋 gameplay variations, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Other than the one we just saw, 🍋 this next one, here, doesn't actually 🍊 show you the word in Japanese 🍋 - [only] has the English words, 🍊 so it might be a bit difficult to 🍋 guess what the word is gonna be. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You're gonna have [to] pick 🍋 a few random letters first 🍊 and hope you get lucky. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the last gameplay variation 🍋 is one for 2 players [only]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You and Bluto compete to catch 🍋 letters that Olive Oyl is throwing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This one is set in the, 🍋 uh, Sea Hags level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I guess we do 🍋 learn something from this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even in Japan, educational games 🍋 are really not a whole lot of fun. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Baseball 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1983 December 07 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We enter the all-important 🍋 month of December with "Baseball". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This would be the Sp... -- first 🍋 Sports Game from Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Make a note of that music, 🍋 because we'll be hearing the 🍊 exact same music 🍋 in the game, "Tennis". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as we start the game, here, 🍋 notice that it actually allows you 🍊 to choose your team, represented 🍋 by those little letters, there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll discuss that in more detail, 🍋 in just a moment. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, it's a long-standing 🍋 video game tradition that, 🍊 when game makers 🍋 come out with a new console, 🍊 usually one of the very first things they 🍋 do is put out some Sports Games on it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And that's exactly what Nintendo 🍋 is doing; we're gonna be covering 🍊 "Baseball", "Tennis", and "Golf", 🍋 this episode. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If ya think about it, this makes sense. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, Nintendo didn't wanna 🍋 invest too many resources 🍊 into creating brand new games, 🍊 so they just sorta stuck with 🍋 some of the standard formulas, 🍊 while they waited to see how the 🍋 whole thing kinda worked out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Baseball' video games have been 🍋 around for quite some time, 🍊 going back to the very earliest 🍋 days of home consoles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There've also been some 🍋 'baseball' Arcade games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's take a look at some, now. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, for example, is "Double Play", 🍋 from M... -- Midway, from 1977. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of early 'baseball' games 🍋 tended to look kinda like this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Major advances in Sports Games 🍊 were made with the 🍋 release of the Intellivision, 🍊 which was known for its 🍋 reasonably realistic Sports Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here is 🍋 "All Star Major League Baseball". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was conkidered -- 🍋 considered to be [pretty] -- 🍊 [pretty] hot, stuff 🍋 back in the day. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is, I suppose, 🍋 a somewhat reasonable, 🍊 you know, facsimile of how 🍋 'baseball''s actually played. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, let's take a look at 🍋 something for the ColecoVision: 🍊 "Super Action Baseball", from 1983. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The ColecoVision was the 🍋 most graphically advanced 🍊 home console, at the time, 🍋 though in this case the game 🍊 suffers from a [pretty] 🍋 ugly color scheme 🍊 and horrible little, 🍋 uh, animations 🍊 of the characters running around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then, suddenly, 🍋 one year later we jump to this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Wow. 🍋 What a difference! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Look at the players! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They have, like, 🍋 uniforms on and everything! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, relatively realistic animations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, furthermore, the game even 🍋 has two different camera angles! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When you're batting or pitching, 🍋 the camera is sort of zoomed in, 🍊 right on the diamond; 🍋 when ya hit a ball, then, like, 🍊 suddenly it goes back out and 🍋 you can see the entire outfield. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can see a scoreboard 🍋 in the background, 🍊 you can see people in the 🍋 audience; it's very nice! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, like a lot of 🍋 early 'baseball' games, 🍊 the controls on this 🍋 are [pretty] simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You mostly just control 🍋 the pitcher and the batter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You use the button to either 🍋 swing the bat or throw the pitch. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The D-Pad'll let you move 🍋 your bat around a bit or 🍊 give you a certain amount of 🍋 control over the kind of pitch 🍊 (you know, fastball, 🍋 to the left, to the right). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have a very limited control 🍋 over the players in the outfield. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once they have the ball, use 🍋 the D-Pad to control the throw. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, pressing Up 🍋 will throw to second base, 🍊 pressing Right will throw 🍋 to first base, and so on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now of course, back then, 🍋 if you take a look at this game, 🍊 like, nowhere in the game 🍋 or on the box are there any 🍊 sorts of names of baseball players 🍋 or any of the sports teams or -- 🍊 or anything that would 🍋 have to be licensed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is in no way affiliated 🍋 with any sort of, like, 🍊 Major League Baseball 🍋 team or product, 🍊 but it still does 🍋 (in sort of a sly way) 🍊 refer to actual teams. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, for example, it shows you the 🍋 first letter of each team's names. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here, for example, "D" 🍋 is presumably the Dodgers, 🍊 based on their 🍋 uniform color scheme. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, even though the game doesn't 🍋 actually mention the Dodgers, 🍊 you can still sorta feel 🍋 like you're playing them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, still, I don't believe there's 🍋 any sort of, like, differences 🍊 between the teams, in terms 🍋 of stats or anything [like] that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [only] real differences are 🍋 simply the colors of the uniforms. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I'd say "Baseball"'s, 🍋 all in all, a [pretty] good game, 🍊 and for Nintendo's first Sports Game, 🍋 it is, uh, [pretty] impressive. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Donkī Kongu Junia no Sansuu Asobi 🇯🇵 // Donkey Kong Jr. Math 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1983 December 13 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For our final game of 1983, 🍋 we have one that you probably hated, 🍊 if your parents got it 🍋 for ya, back then. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's 🍋 "Donkey Kong Jr. no Sansuu Asobi" 🍊 or, as we call it in the U.S., 🍋 "Donkey Kong Jr. Math". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, yup, just like that "Popeye..." 🍋 game, this is an educational game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it was undoubtedly 🍋 a quickie game that, uh, 🍊 was made simply so they could 🍋 re-use some of the sprites 🍊 from "Donkey Kong Jr." 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, so anyway, 🍊 if you don't recall this game, 🍋 this is how it works. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It displays a number, 🍋 up at the top of the screen, 🍊 and you're supposed to jump 🍋 around and collect the numbers... 🍊 the mathematical symbols, 🍋 in order to get everything to 🍊 add up to that particular number. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 here we're supposed to get 77. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We already have nine, so we're 🍋 gonna grab the times symbol, 🍊 and then grab 8. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That'll take us up to 72. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then, all we have [to] do after 🍋 that is to find 5 and add that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is a 2-Player game [only], 🍋 so the pink Donkey Kong 🍊 (I assume that's 🍋 Donkey Kong Jr.'s sister) 🍊 should also be trying [to] do the 🍋 exact same thing at the same time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a second option 🍋 on the title screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's simply the exact same game, 🍋 except the numbers involved are larger. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's one last final option as well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Either way, this is probably not a game 🍋 you really would have enjoyed playing, 🍊 you know, back in, uh, 1985, when 🍋 it came out in the United States, 🍊 and it's probably not a game 🍋 that you'd really enjoy playing now. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Presumably Nintendo created 🍋 these games, so they could 🍊 (like I said earlier) re-use some 🍋 existing sprites and to make a game 🍊 that was, in theory, "educational", 🍋 but they [pretty] much dropped 🍊 the whole educational game, 🍋 uh, thing almost immediately. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 From this point forward, 🍋 generally speaking, 🍊 educational games would 🍋 be left to other publishers. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to 1984 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 By the time 1984 opened, 🍊 it was [pretty] clear the FamiCom 🍋 was gonna be a success in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Despite that, this st... -- year still 🍋 started kinda slowly for releases. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, [only] six games were 🍋 released in the first half of 1984 🍊 (as compared to nine games 🍋 for the previous six months). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, we really won't see the 🍋 pace of new FamiCom games 🍊 pick up until [pretty] late in 1984. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tennis 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 January 14 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So let's get January 1984 🍋 rolling with "Tennis"! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was, in fact, the [only] 🍋 game released in January. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing you may have 🍋 noticed here, is Nintendo's 🍊 sorta tryin' to go for, like, a 🍋 house style, with their title screens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They all look [pretty] much the same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They've all got a very simple logo, 🍋 couple different play options, 🍊 the "Copyright Nintendo" 🍋 against a black background, 🍊 usually a short little 🍋 musical tune [will] be playing... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually they would 🍋 get a bit more creative, 🍊 but for the time being, 🍋 this is sort of, like, 🍊 the look that they were going for. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the FamiCom box art had 🍋 a very similar feel to it, as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All the box art 🍋 kind of looked the same. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, anyway, here we have "Tennis" 🍊 (which is, obviously, based on 🍋 the real life game of 'tennis'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I've gotta confess; 🍊 I usually don't really like video 🍋 games based around 'tennis'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess part of the problem is that, 🍋 you know, you ha... to -- you have to 🍊 sort of depict a 3D reality 🍋 (a ball moving towards you) 🍊 you know, in a 🍋 two dimensional video game, 🍊 which is really not that easy, 🍋 especially back at this time, 🍊 but here Nintendo does manage 🍋 to do a [pretty] admirable job. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They've depicted the tennis court 🍋 from [a] top down perspective, 🍊 but it's sort of slightly angled. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a bit of 🍋 perspective in the court. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For the tennis ball, they actually 🍋 use several different sprites, 🍊 so it gets bigger, 🍋 as it comes towards you, 🍊 and as it recedes 🍋 it just becomes a tiny dot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a shadow on the ball, 🍋 which gives you some assistance 🍊 interpreting how high 🍋 off the ground the ball is 🍊 and the shadow also 🍋 gets smaller and larger. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, from a strictly 🍋 technical perspective, 🍊 the game is [pretty] impressive 🍋 in the way it tries to depict a ball 🍊 moving back and forth in space. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, something else 🍋 interesting, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The referee looks a lot like Mario! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Well, he's this little 🍋 short guy with a mustache.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's not dressed like Mario, but 🍋 this does appear to be Mario's first, 🍊 kind of, cameo appearance 🍋 in a Sports Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo would later go on to 🍋 put him in all their Golf Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, it appears, 🍋 even at this early stage, 🍊 Mario was essentially 🍋 the Nintendo mascot. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game plays [pretty] simply. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Move your, uh, 🍋 figure back and forth, 🍊 using the D-Pad; 🍋 use the button to swing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you hit the button, like, hard 🍋 or s... -- or softly, that'll, sort of, 🍊 control the strength of the -- 🍋 of the swing, just a bit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The title screen allows you 🍋 to select the difficulty option. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Back then, video games had a 🍋 whole lot [of] difficulty options. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, they still do nowadays, 🍋 but [in] the days of the 2600, 🍊 for example, there were always, 🍋 like, fifty different options 🍊 on every video game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, while "Tennis" 🍋 isn't exactly fantastic, 🍊 it's, uh, still plays [pretty] good, 🍋 and I'd say it's a lot better 🍊 than some of the other 🍋 third-party 'tennis' games 🍊 [that] would eventually 🍋 come out for the system. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pinball 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 February 02 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so you've done 🍋 some basic board games, 🍊 you've got a few Sports Games 🍋 on the system, so what's next? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, something a lot of 🍋 video game developers would do 🍊 would be to create a 'pinball' game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At this time (the early '80s) 🍋 'pinball' was still quite 🍊 popular in the arcades. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot [of] decent-sized 🍋 video arcades would have 🍊 some pinball tables in there, 🍊 as well (and, of course, 🍋 they had been [in] arcades 🍊 much longer than video games). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thus, we have Nintendo's "Pinball". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, something that's a 🍋 little cool and different, here, 🍊 is that this game ha... -- 🍋 actually has two screens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's sort of, like, 🍋 a top half and a bottom half. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When the ball drops down below, 🍋 it goes into the lower screen, 🍊 and if you shoot back up, 🍋 it goes back [to the] top screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This allowed Nintendo to, sort of, 🍋 create a bigger pinball table. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, how does the thing control? 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 Well, it's sort of a unique setup. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 With your right hand, you can 🍋 hit either of the two buttons; 🍊 this will control the right flipper. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 With your left hand, 🍋 you control the D-Pad 🍊 (doesn't matter which 🍋 direction you push it in); 🍊 this will do the left flipper. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, this gives the game 🍋 somewhat of a feel, 🍊 like a r... p... -- real pinball machine. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you saw the 🍋 American cover, there, 🍊 a moment ago, 🍋 you might [be] wondering, 🍊 "Why is Mario on the cover? 🍋 What's he have to do [with] this game?". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, he actually does have 🍋 another cameo, just like "Tennis", 🍊 though this one's 🍋 a bit more hidden. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess this might be 🍋 one of the first examples [of], 🍊 like, a hidden mini-game, 🍋 inside a larger game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, it's really 🍋 not that well hidden. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, if you play 🍋 this for a little while, 🍊 you'll eventually come 🍋 [across] it, mostly by accident. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the bottom screen, 🍋 kind of near the upper 🍊 right hand corner, 🍋 there's, like, a little hole 🍊 that you can 🍋 shoot your ball into. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you get lucky and 🍋 get your ball there 🍊 you actually go into this 🍋 little mini-game which is, 🍊 kind of, sort of, 🍋 like "Breakout". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 What it is is Mario will be 🍋 holding a platform on his head. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can move him 🍋 back and forth, uh, 🍊 try to bounce the ball 🍋 off the platform, 🍊 and free Pauline 🍋 from the prison above. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this was a bit before 🍋 Princess Peach entered the picture, 🍊 so, Pauline is still Mario's 🍋 main love interest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, anyway, I guess 🍋 that Pinball's probably 🍊 a [pretty] minor 🍋 early FamiCom title. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] certainly wasn't bad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the other hand, like... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In 1983, E.A. had released 🍋 "Pinball Construction Set", 🍊 which is a game that's a lot 🍋 more fondly remembered. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, later on, you'd see stuff, 🍋 like, for the TurboGrafx 16 🍊 (like "Alien Crush") which were 🍋 much more interesting games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Still, Nintendo hasn't 🍋 exactly made a whole lot 🍊 of Pinball video games, 🍊 so I suppose that, in a way, 🍋 this is sort of a unique title. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Wild Gunman 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 February 18 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The other game to be released in 🍋 February of 1984 is "Wild Gunman". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Wild Gunman" is interesting 🍋 for a few different reasons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, this is not exactly 🍋 a port of an early Arcade game, 🍊 nor is it based on a 🍋 board game or a sport, 🍊 so I suppose it's one of the earlier 🍋 original titles for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But also, check this out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Fire!" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, there's an honest-to-God 🍋 speech sample in this 🍊 (almost unheard of, at the time). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were a few games 🍋 for the Intellivision 🍊 that used its special 🍋 speech [synthesizer], 🍊 but it was still [pretty] rare. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as I mentioned, 🍊 "Wild Gunman" was 🍋 more or less an original title, 🍊 but it was based on 🍋 a much earlier 🍊 (sort of, not video game, 🍋 but arcade) game, 🍊 called "Wild Gunman", that re... -- 🍋 Nintendo released, back in 1974. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This had an actual 16 millimeter 🍋 f... uh -- film that played, 🍊 and then you shot at it, 🍋 though the basic idea is the 🍊 same as the FamiCom game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, if you've seen 🍋 "Back to [the] Future: Part II", 🍊 you will see a special, 🍋 uh, "Wild Gunman" 🍊 free standing arcade cabinet, 🍋 that was never actually 🍊 produced for real arcades. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently it was made just 🍋 for the movie, for some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, perhaps most interesting 🍋 of all was the fact that 🍊 you control this game, 🍋 by using a light gun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, this game was the debut 🍋 of the Nintendo light gun. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, take a look at what 🍋 the original Japanese 🍊 FamiCom light gun looks like. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, wow, it looks 🍋 just like a real gun! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It looks like a Colt or something 🍊 (really, nothing at all like 🍋 that crazy, uh, orange Zapper 🍊 that came with the 🍋 Nintendo Entertainment System). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess, uh, in the United States, 🍋 at that time, you really couldn't 🍊 get away with making your 🍋 toy guns look like real guns. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, how does the game actually play? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, very simply, each round 🍋 one of these bad guys marches out 🍊 and ya have to shoot him! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, don't worry, 🍋 [you] don't actually kill them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You know, you always just, like, 🍋 shoot their hat off or their pants off 🍊 or something like that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now it is possible to shoot too fast. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you shoot before the, uh, 🍋 guy is ready, you'll get a foul 🍊 and you'll lose the round. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Likewise, if you get shot, 🍋 you lose the round as well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's also a 🍋 harder difficulty setting, 🍊 in which they come out 🍋 two at a time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And finally, difficulty option C 🍋 is the gang setting. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's where you're 🍋 not out in the desert; 🍊 you're actually in a town, 🍋 in front of a saloon, 🍊 and the bad guys will, sort of, 🍋 open up the various windows 🍊 and doors and shoot at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This particular kind of layout 🍊 would, sort of, be the standard 🍋 for most light gun games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] usually involves quick reflexes 🍋 and having to shoot [an] enemy 🍊 as soon as he 🍋 appears on the screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Wild Gunman" isn't 🍋 exactly the most interesting 🍊 or exciting light gun game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It is the first one on the system, 🍋 and, I mean, back then, of course 🍊 (well, Nintendo had been 🍋 developing light gun toys 🍊 and whatnot, for quite some time, 🍋 as well as light gun Arcade games, 🍊 but) a light gun 🍋 home console game 🍊 was [pretty] much 🍋 unheard of, at this time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The light gun would go on to 🍋 become quite popular in the U.S. 🍊 but not so much with 🍋 this game, but rather 🍊 with the next game 🍋 we're going to see. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Duck Hunt 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 April 21 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As ya may have noticed there, 🍋 a second ago, 🍊 "Duck Hunt" came 🍋 out on April 21st. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's over two months 🍋 after "Wild Gunman". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why the big d... -- long 🍋 delay between games? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I don't really know, 🍋 but it couldn't have been 🍊 because they were putting a 🍋 whole lot [of] time into this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Duck Hunt" is probably, 🍋 about the simplest game 🍊 Nintendo ever released, 🍋 though I mean, 🍊 I may [as] well admit, 🍋 [it] does look [pretty] nice. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd say the most memorable 🍋 thing about this game 🍊 is probably the way 🍋 that dog sticks its head up 🍊 and laughs at you, 🍋 every time you miss a duck. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, 🍋 it has that sort of catchy 🍊 (but incredibly short) 🍋 piece of music that plays. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Out of all the games 🍋 Nintendo developed, 🍊 this must be the one 🍊 with the least amount 🍋 of music written for it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you had a N.E.S., 🍋 back in the day, 🍊 you probably 🍋 remember this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, when it was first 🍋 released in the United States, 🍊 this game was a pack in title, 🍊 in the version of the Nintendo 🍋 that came with the Zapper. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure a lot [of] people never 🍋 bought another Zapper game, 🍊 so this is the one 🍋 they probably think of, 🍊 when they think of 🍋 the light gun games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose there is a certain 🍋 sort of genius in its simplicity. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Really, all that 🍋 happens in this game 🍊 is two ducks fly up 🍋 and [you] try to shoot 'em. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you miss, 🍋 the dog'll laugh at you! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there is a slightly more 🍋 challenging mode in this 🍊 (the one that probably most 🍋 [of] you guys didn't play); 🍊 it's the, uh, clay pigeon shooting. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a bit more difficult, 🍋 but the screen is also 🍊 incredibly dull 🍋 and boring looking. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, for such a classic title, 🍋 I really don't think Nintendo 🍊 put a whole lot [of] time into this! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, at some point, 🍋 someone at Nintendo realized 🍊 that what players really wanna 🍋 do is to shoot the darn dog, 🍊 so, when this came out 🍋 in the arcade version 🍊 (it was, like, one of those, 🍋 uh, 'Play Choice 10' titles) 🍊 you actually could 🍋 shoot the dog, 🍊 though, of course, 🍋 he would get upset if you did. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, and we do actually 🍋 have one more light gun game 🍊 coming up, 🍋 in just a few minutes. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Golf 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 May 01 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The [only] game to be 🍋 released in May of 1984: 🍊 it's Nintendo's "Golf" (the third 🍋 title in Nintendo's sports series). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing you might notice, here, 🍊 is that "Golf" is entirely devoid of 🍋 any sort of music, whatsoever. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] mean, there's some sound 🍋 effects, but there's no music 🍊 during the title screen 🍋 or during the game itself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This might be 🍋 considered evidence 🍊 that Nintendo were 🍋 stretching themselves a bit thin, 🍊 when it comes to 🍋 getting out all these games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, anyway, Nintendo's "Golf" 🍋 introduces a control scheme 🍊 that would become 🍋 [pretty] much standard 🍊 for Golf Games, on the system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You use the D-Pad to select 🍋 which golf club you wanna use, 🍊 and you use the Left and Right 🍋 on the D-Pad to control, sort of, 🍊 the general direction 🍋 of your swing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Golf" also uses a very 🍋 interesting mechanic 🍊 to actually control your swing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You press the button once 🍋 to move your club back. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've got it back far enough, 🍋 press it again to move forward, 🍊 and then press it a third time, 🍋 right when the arrow reaches 🍊 those... little group of white lines, 🍋 on the meter below you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The second button press will 🍋 control the power of the swing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The further you let -- 🍋 you let it go back, 🍊 the stronger your swing will be. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Press[ing] the button again, 🍋 when the little arrow's 🍊 right in that little group 🍋 of white boxes, there, 🍊 will make your swing more accurate. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you press it too early or too late, 🍋 you will either hook or slice the ball. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But this rather 🍋 unique control scheme 🍊 makes "Golf" a little revolutionary. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Of] course there had been Golf Games -- 🍋 Golf video games before this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, there were 🍋 some games on the 2600 🍊 and there were some 🍋 arcade Golf Games, as well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But this mechanism you use to 🍋 hit the ball is actually quite new. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some of the older arcade 🍋 games used a trackball. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That is, you hit the ball, and 🍋 then you'd move the trackball 🍊 as fast [as] you could, in order 🍋 to get the golf ball to move. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, there are lots 🍋 of nice little realistic touches, 🍊 like you can tell which 🍋 direction the wind is blowing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are water traps, 🍋 sand traps, all that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, in comparison to 🍋 using the regular golf clubs, 🍊 putting is a little bit different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you see, there's no white boxes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can't really, sort of, 🍋 cause your ball to go astray, 🍊 using putting, uh, but you can 🍋 hit it not hard enough or too hard 🍊 and it'll go' right past the hole. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And also the greens tend to, 🍋 sort of, have a, like, 🍊 a little bit of a slant to them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The arrows on the green will 🍊 show you which direction 🍋 the green is sort of graded. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, when [you] hit your ball, 🍋 it won't necessarily 🍊 go completely straight; it can go 🍋 downhill a bit and miss the hole. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, 🍋 as you may have figured out, 🍊 I guess this guy is 🍋 supposed to be Mario 🍊 (probably looking as 🍋 unlike Mario as he ever has). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also [very] clearly depicted here 🍋 as being sort of a chubby fellow. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the Japanese box art, 🍋 you don't see his face 🍊 and he doesn't look 🍋 like Mario, whatsoever. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the U.S. box art, he was 🍋 clearly drawn as being Mario. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess it is a little 🍋 weird to see Mario, 🍊 dressed up in civilian clothing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In Japan, this game 🍋 was quite successful. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It sold, I think 🍋 several million copies 🍊 (one of the better-selling games 🍋 [of] the system, as far as I'm aware). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It certainly influenced 🍋 enough other Golf Games 🍊 (most of the subsequent games 🍋 on the FamiCom really seemed, 🍊 kinda like a slight 🍋 variation on this one). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo, themselves, would go on 🍋 to release numerous Golf Games, 🍊 all of which were 🍋 very similar to this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By today's standards, the game 🍋 is a little on the simple side, 🍊 but it still plays [pretty] well. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hogan's Alley 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 June 12 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 From June 1984, 🍊 it's our last game this episode, 🍋 "Hogan's Alley" 🍊 (the game that's so complicated 🍋 it actually requires a individual, 🍊 sort of, training screen that 🍋 shows ya what targets to hit 🍊 and what targets not to hit). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Hogan's Alley" is, once again, 🍋 a light gun game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The object here is to, well, 🍋 basically shoot the bad guys. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is sort of like 🍋 a training simulator, 🍊 here, for cops or 🍋 something like that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These little, uh, 🍋 cardboard figures slide out 🍊 and you want to shoot 🍋 the ones that look villainous, 🍊 and, uh, not shoot the ones 🍋 that look like friendly old men 🍊 or little ladies or cops. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [If] you'll look down at 🍋 the bottom, there, 🍊 you'll notice there's a, 🍋 uh, a miss counter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can [only] miss 🍋 so many times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That means hitting 🍋 the wrong target 🍊 or not hitting 🍋 the right target. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] think you can get 🍋 about ten misses 🍊 and then the game ends. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, ya might be wondering, 🍊 "What exactly does the name 🍋 'Hogan's Alley' mean?". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, a 'Hogan's Alley' is 🍋 sort of a general term 🍊 for these firearms 🍋 training places, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There actually was an 🍋 original 'Hogan's Alley'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] believe it was designed 🍋 by the U.S. military. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You'd go in there and, 🍋 suddenly, uh, various, like, 🍊 cutouts of people would 🍋 pop up and you'd have 🍊 to shoot the right ones. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess this was to train 🍋 your reflexes and judgment, 🍊 when it comes to 🍋 handling a firearm. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You've probably seen 🍋 things like this 🍊 (maybe on T.V. or movies) 🍋 where someone has to, 🍊 you know, train (become 🍋 an F.B.I. agent or a cop 🍊 or something like that). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I believe that the F.B.I. had 🍋 a 'Hogan's Alley' in place, 🍊 about the same time 🍋 this game came out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The police officer, here, 🍋 is sort [of] interesting. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's smiling. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the other hand, he's also, 🍋 sort of, holding his billy club 🍊 and putting it [in] 🍋 the palm [of] his hand, 🍊 almost like he's kinda 🍋 thinkin' he wants to, like, 🍊 smack ya on the head with it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He does seem just a bit menacing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay. So, then there's 🍋 the 'Hogan's Alley B' option. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, instead of a 🍋 standard shooting range, 🍊 you're actually in some 🍋 sort of m... -- alley mockup, 🍊 and the little, ah, figures 🍋 appear in the windows 🍊 and doorways and 🍋 try to shoot at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually an awful lot like 🍊 one [of] the options 🍋 in "Wild Gunman". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even at this stage, 🍊 Nintendo is not above 🍋 re-using the same ideas. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is probably 🍊 a bit more interesting 🍋 than the first option. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a bit more variety; 🍊 you have, you know, 🍋 actual backgrounds in it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing [I've] always wondered: 🍊 That one gangster - 🍊 is he dressed up, 🍋 wearing a tuxedo? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was nice of him 🍊 to put on such a formal 🍋 get up, for this occasion. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one other thing that 🍋 is quite n... -- notable, here, 🍊 is that, you know, 🍋 as the scene switches, 🍊 you'll see what appears 🍋 [to] be the earliest instance 🍊 of sideways scrolling 🍋 in a FamiCom game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing about the FamiCom: 🍋 It was designed so [that it] 🍊 was very efficient 🍋 at sideways scrolling - 🍊 something that some 🍋 of the other machines 🍊 available at the time, 🍋 like the M.S.X. computers, 🍊 really could not do. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When you think of the system, 🍊 you tend to think of all 🍋 those, like, uh, scrolling, 🍊 uh, games like "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a little unusual that 🍋 the FamiCom has been 🍊 out in the market for a year, 🍋 and this is the first game 🍊 that we've seen that 🍋 actually utilizes scrolling. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, there's one final variation, 🍋 here, and it's called 'Trick Shot'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is where ya shoot at cans 🍊 and try to keep 'em, sort of, 🍋 you know, up in the air 🍊 and get 'em to 🍋 land on a platform. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll then get some points, 🍊 depending on which platform 🍋 you land 'em on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, why does the 🍋 music from this 🍊 sound like something from 🍋 an old 'Small Faces' song? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe it's just a coincidence. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 1 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so that wraps up 🍋 the last game, this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, what did we learn, here? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, while none of these 🍋 games are exactly bad 🍊 (I mean, they're all 🍋 reasonably well made) 🍊 none of 'em [are] really... 🍋 that exciting. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, I think probably 🍋 the game that most folks 🍊 would remember would 🍋 probably be "Duck Hunt". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nothing wrong with "Duck Hunt"; 🍋 it's just a very simplistic game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was something that was 🍋 kind of, like, you know, 🍊 good to pull out at, 🍋 you know, parties 🍊 or some'm or 🍋 for a [bit] of fun, 🍊 but it's not really 🍋 a game that I think 🍊 people would normally put on 🍊 a list of all-time favorite games, 🍋 or anything like that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, you know, 🍋 a few of these games, 🍊 such as "Golf" and "Mahjong", 🍋 ended up being 🍊 very successful, 🍋 [at] least in Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, for most of us, 🍋 I think we'd still, sort of, 🍊 think of the FamiCom 🍋 as being in, sort of, like, 🍊 [an] experimental stage, 🍋 at this point 🍊 (hasn't really 🍋 found its groove, yet). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya might say the 🍋 really interesting things 🍊 didn't start to 🍋 happen until 1985. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, there ya have it! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Chrontendo Episode 1: 🍋 Revised Edition"! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hopefully it turned out 🍊 a bit better than the 🍋 original Episode 1, 🍊 and maybe someday 🍊 I'll get around to re-recording 🍋 Episodes 2 and 3 as well! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the meantime, 🍋 keep an eye out for 🍊 actual brand new 🍋 episodes of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇🍌
