👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 35 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Today we finish up August 1988 and move into September! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A couple notable things this time around: 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We are going to be introduced to one of the longest-running Japanese R.P.G. series, we've also bought a couple Sports Games, and [only] one Military Strategy Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also Konami and Pony Canyon totally dominate this episode with three games each. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Almost half the games today are from those two companies! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, let's get rolling. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mad City 🇯🇵 // Adventures of Bayou Billy 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 12 🇯🇵 // 1989 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, we're going to start off with one of the big games this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, it's a Konami game, "Mad City" ([I have] no idea what that name is supposed to mean). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The viewers will more likely know this under the Western release title, "The Adventures of Bayou Billy". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] got a fancy new title screen and even some speech samples. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, "...Adventures of Bayou Billy" is one of the most hated Konami N.E.S. games for a good reason. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just too damned hard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll discuss that in just a moment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First, let's note that Konami clearly modeled the protagonist on Paul Hogan's Crocodile Dundee character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you weren't around in the '80s, you might not realize just how goddamn popular the 'Crocodile Dundee' movies actually worth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first movie made over $300 million, which is about what the 'Twilight' movies make nowadays, in today's money. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can really see the resemblance there in Billy's death scene. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like I said, most everyone hates this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we're actually going to be playing the original Japanese version, which has been translated into English. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game was changed up quite a bit for the U.S. release (mostly by making it considerably more difficult). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even weak enemies take way too many hits to kill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it seems that the food and weapons are more, uh, common and the Japanese version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While still a difficult game, it's more playable than "...Bayou Billy". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You may have noticed the "[OH] GOD!" dialogue balloon a moment ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this may have been written by the same guy who wrote "I essentially Nicole". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, "Mad City" starts off as a Technos-style Beat-'em-Up, in which your character can move from the front to the screen or the back of the screen by pressing Up or Down. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to be lined up vertically with your opponent or to actually hit them, especially when using the knives or the gun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Billy can perform a Punch, Kick, or a Jumping Kick. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also pick up weapons, which (hurray!) are usable until the end of the level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They don't disappear after a few moments, like in so many other Beat-'em-Ups. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Between levels, you get those little intermission screens, where the bad guy taunts you with your tied up girlfriend in the background. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These, of course, would be found later in many other Beat-'em-Ups, as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the weird thing about "...Bayou Billy". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's mostly a Beat-'em-Up but Konami threw in a few Light Gun levels and Driving levels to, sort of, mix it up a bit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Light Gun levels are okay, I guess. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I find to be, sort of, tedious. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can use a Light Gun or a D-Pad depending on which game option you choose in the main menu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the D-Pad makes it a bit more difficult. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This helicopter boss I guess is [pretty] cool-looking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the driving segments really don't work that well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your object is delayed to beat the timer while avoiding getting killed by other vehicles and old-fashioned looking bomb dropping parasol wing aircraft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which makes you wonder what time periods is going to take place and anyway? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, for some unknown reason, Billy has machine gun mounted to his jeep which you can use to shoot the other cars. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also toss sticks of dynamite at the planes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you reach New Orleans. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your fight your way down Bourbon Street, get the best weapon of the game, the whip, which is very useful for taking down enemies without getting too close to them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you get to the seconds of Light Gun section. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here I think I'm actually Using the D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really hard to control. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The crosshairs across the screen really quickly, so it's difficult to aim precisely. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a certain amount of luck required in this level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it'll randomly drop help refills or ammo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if they don't drop any extra ammo you can run out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I did die a couple times playing this to the lack of ammo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you get the toughest and most infuriating bosses in the entire game, especially the little guy who throws knives that are really hard-to-hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game can get a little tricky in places. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fortunately, you will pick up some extra lives along the way and you make the last boss with a whip and the bulletproof jacket, you're [pretty] much good to go. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Facing against the final boss and his luxuriously decorated mansion and then it became, sort of, a cliche and Beat-'em-Up, but it was still [pretty] fresh, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He does move [pretty] quickly fat guy,. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the last boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, with the whip and some patience. You can defeat these guys who were they're supposed to be no problem. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here's the, sort of, a cool thing left out in the U.S. version. I believe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are multiple endings depending on what you do at the very end. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you're reunited with your kidnapped girlfriend and do nothing special, you get the standard happy ending. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And just like "Castlevania", there's also a mock credit sequence At the end. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Billy's full name is given as unfortunately Billy West. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So nowadays he shares the name with the prolific cartoon voice actor. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game does share a few things with Konami's 'Castlevania' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like the whip looks just like belmonts whip. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The multiple endings to similar "Castlevania II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The music is fantastic - definitely the funkiest music we've heard on the N.E.S. so far. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the second ending. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to hold down select an up when Annabel hugs you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A dialog is different, but it's still a happy ending. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'd say where "Mad City" fails, the driving and shooting parts don't really seem fully developed and function more, sort of, filler. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the U.S. version is even worse because all the enemies take way too long to kill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Takes forever to like kill a screen full of guys. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Does seem, sort of, a bit Like filler to me. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and here's the bad ending. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to avoid letting Anabelle touch you just walking around in circles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you get the sad ending. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's actually another ending if you play the practice rounds before you start the main game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also a [pretty] worthless quiz section as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So my final opinion, the U.S. version is too tedious and unbalanced. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese game is [pretty] fun, though it certainly falls below such Konami classics as "Castlevania" or "Contra". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, I'd recommend if you want to play Konami's first ever Beat-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Before they perfected the formula a few years later, go ahead and give it a shot, especially the Japanese version. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Konamic Tennis 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Konami's 'Exciting Sports' series is dead and in its place is virtually identical series of Sports Games, all of which say, 'Konamiku' in the title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is clearly a pun on 'dainamiku' (or 'dynamic'). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So 'Konamiku' is a portmanteau of sorts between 'Konami' and 'dynamic' is usually transliterated as 'Konamic'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we're going to be calling this one "Konamic Tennis". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe the Japanese "Blades of Steel" was actually the first game to use this title, though I didn't notice the 'Konamic' in the name when I covered that game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, you have your usual options Tounament, Single Game, you choose your team. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everything looks [pretty] much like every other F.D.S. Sports Game we've seen so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is actually the fourth Tennis Game for the FamiCom, I believe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo, Bandai, and Jaleco all had Tennis Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main innovation here is the animation your character when you're serving the ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As always, serving, by the way, is very finicky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a very brief window to hit the balls, it's coming down. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise, we'll either hit the net or go out of bounds. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When playing on the near side of the screen, you need to press the button right when the ball touches the service line. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have two types of swings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They seem to result in a fast low ball or a high slower ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The high swing causes a really goofy sound effect. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also an 'Exciting Mode', in which a second person inserts his copy of the game and you can play against his team. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The fact that it's actually called 'Exciting Mode' makes me wonder if Konami was still confused over the name switch from 'Exciting...' to 'Dynamic...'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than that, it appears to be just a regular old Tennis Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hototogisu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tamtex 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, here we have one from Irem. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A reasonably good-looking intro starts the game off, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You may have noted the developers name was Tamtax. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They should change that name if you'd asked me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But they were some sort of internal development division within Irem. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Hototogisu". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll be up front; this is yet another Sengoku Era Strategy Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So basically we're looking at Nobunaga's Ambition Part Six. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably the most interesting thing to most viewers is the very cool opening sequence, which makes medieval Japanese warfare look like was straight out of an anime or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Music's [pretty] good too. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, like we were saying, definitely not a bad intro. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though one thing that puzzles me is the name. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Hototogisu' is the Japanese name for a kind of cuckoo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What this bird has anything to do with Samurai warfare is beyond me. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Interesting, there's a "Samurai Sword" in "Final Fantasy XI" called the 'Hototogisu'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe a cuckoo is considered to be some sort of a badass bird in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well anyway, is this game any different than all the others? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eh, maybe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's a bit more complicated and supposedly historically realistic than some of the other games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As always, to choose your daimyo; there are about 40 choices altogether. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, then it's... collect taxes, engage in diplomacy, and warfare, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Supposedly, this is a decent reputation in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, Irem released a sequel on the PSP not that long ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though the game is somehow -- mixes in collectible cards into the Strategy genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you might know, collectible card Arcade Games became [pretty] popular in Japan a few years back. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The world was not able to get deep into this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, I foolishly, sort of, fight for building my army. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a bad move. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you actually must see more kowtow to you, so there's actually a 33 part Let's Play on YouTube. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As for me, I'll just summarize. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, it does appear to be a [pretty] good-looking Military Strategy type game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Eggerland - Souzouhe no Tabidachi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL Laboratory 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, here's an unusual situation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last episode "Chrontendo Episode 34" had an 'Eggerland' game from HAL. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now today we have another one - except instead of being on a cart, it's on disk (or rather the Disk Writer). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last one came out August 9th, and this one's on August 20th. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So two 'Eggerland' games in a two week period. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like I said, that's a bit unusual. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this new one is a totally different game from the last Last one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It has, interestingly enough, an animated intro (something missing in the last game). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I thought Lolo is always trying to rescue his girlfriend in these games, but she doesn't seem to be very kidnapped and actually waits for him outside the castle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, the structure of the game has been changed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The previous two took place in a maze-like castle will be true interconnected with other rooms through a series of doors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Often a room would have more than one door so you know how to figure out how to get the key in each room, but also how to make your way through the castle in the maze-like layout. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here there are no doors; everything is strictly linear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After getting a key, you simply move on to the next level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This new game is also much shorter than usual. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think it's [only] around 50 levels, and it's also noticeably easier in the last few 'Eggerland' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On a positive note, this one does have the construction mode missing from the last game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which makes sense considering the FamiCom Disk System ability to save your data. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So in other words, this is, sort of, like a budget version of "Eggerland". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was never released in boxed form; you actually had to get it by taking a blank disk to a Disk Writer machine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it would have been much cheaper. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sort of like the '80s Japanese equivalent of the PlayStation Network or an Xbox Arcade Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Pinball 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Soft Machine 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Coconuts Japan 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, another title from Coconuts Japan and the mysterious C-Dream. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might remember these guys from that weird Pachinko game where you control a living Pachinko ball who likes to play Pachinko. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So wait a sec, what's with the Mahjong stuff in a Pinball Game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the goal of "Super Pinball" is to obtain the missing Mahjong piece as in the introduction. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To playing pinball in order to complete your Mahjong hand. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, I know that makes literally no sense whatsoever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now remember that Nintendo "Pinball" game from "Chrontendo Episode 1"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When will this is really, sort of, a pumped up version of that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually has kind of like an automotive thing going on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are two main screens, just like "Pinball" (the Nintendo "Pinball"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If your ball drops down to the bottom of the top screen (we're on the top screen here), it'll end up in the bottom screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are various ways to earn clients through the lighting up the four buttons at the very top of the top screen, or going down the shopper app. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But just like Nintendo's "Pinball", there are some harder to find screens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are six all together (that I know of) and I've gone to the trouble of reaching all '60s for this video. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The ramp on the very level to get back to the top screen, but eventually you can use it to get the very top screen (this one right here), which can also be reached via very hard-to-hit ramp on the regular top screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Knocking down those fingers in the upper left corner quite a few points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then we have the U.F.O. screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not even really sure how I even got here. Tie the truth. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then we have the screen with the brain at the top. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you hit one of the beam buttons, it'll fire a laser and blow up the robots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you get the ball on the right top where the brain is, you'll get to the highest screen, which I think is called complete crush. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or into a walk, either destroying the robots and then hitting the brain, or knocking out all the blocks on complete crush will reveal the Mahjong tile. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which is, of course, the point of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, when you lose, you get this crazy picture of a schoolgirl type posing on a completely boxy looking sports car. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, it's not clear to me who C-Dream are or what they did. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Game Developer Research Institute as attached the name Soft Machine to this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Perhaps the [only] game developer named after William Burroughs novel). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's really hard to say who did exactly what still it's a surprisingly good Pinball Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what I found actually more fun than the Mark Flint "Moon Ball" game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ys 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cosmia" ♪ by Joanna Newsom

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 26 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nihon Falcom | Advance Communication 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Victor Musical Industries 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Many of you will undoubtedly recognize this title screen as belonging to "Ys" (or more precisely "Ancient Ys Vanished"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first game in Falcom's cultish series of Action R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll admit, the title screen looks kind of goofy here, sort of, poorly drawn compared to some of the other versions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the FamiCom "Ys" never came out in the West. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we're looking at an unofficial translation from David Mullen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ys", by the way, isn't of a legendary city that vanished into the ocean, sort of, the Atlantis of Brittany. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I thought I read somewhere that the game designers claim not to been inspired by the story of Ys. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the video game story about a mythical civilization called ease is just some sort of weird coincidence. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game actually plops you down in the middle of town with no backstory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You follow the U.S. usual procedure of talking to everyone until you come across the fortune teller who gives you your quest information. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now conveniently, the game starts off with 1000 Gold, which sounds great, but the cheapest weapon here costs 500 Gold. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the world of Ys has suffered some sort of severe inflation in comparison to 'Dragon Quest' and "Final Fantasy". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also some sub quests. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, talking to the guys in the tavern will fill you in on a missing ring. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably the first thing do is try to scrape up enough Gold to buy some decent equipment. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you'll need to kill some monsters, but for God's sake, don't forget to equip everything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is done (sort of, counter intuitively) by going into the proper option in the menu and hitting Down on the D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A little box will appear around the weapon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know why you don't quit that by hitting one of the buttons like every other R.P.G. ever, but there you go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, as mentioned, "Ys" is an Action R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You attack by running into monsters, though it's best to do so from the side or the rear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you do hit one from the front, you want to do so with your character slightly off-center, rather than head-on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will help you avoid damage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But here's the great thing: Unlike say, "Sylviana" your health recharges while standing still in the sunlight. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no Inns or anything like that in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the negative side, you start off very weak and... you see the Experience Meter? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, you need to get 100 Experience Points reach Level 2. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And your first guys in immediate fight drop like 2 Experience, each. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So yeah, the game is kind of grindy. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌠 A Virtually Definitive Tour of the Many Versions of Ys ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the thing about the first "Ys" game is that it's been released and released probably more times and just about any other video game ever (except for maybe "Pac-Man" or something like that). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game has also been expanded and changed quite a bit over the years. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess settle down for a second, because we're going to go through a virtually definitive tour of the main versions of this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ancient Ys Vanished" was first released by Falcom for the P.C.-88 in June 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This version became, sort of, the standard template for the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For a P.C.-88 game, the graphics are [pretty] decent and most notably, the music was very darn catchy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now immediately afterwards, the version for the sharp x one computer was released, which is almost completely identical. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then a couple months later it reached the FM-7 and the FM-77. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again looks just about the same. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It also cannot for the P.C.-98 but that one looks just like the P.C.-88 version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now things were change a bit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In December 1987, a version for the M.S.X. 2 came out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was the first release that actually changed up the graphics a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like the corporate graphics that appear when he talks and when we're all redone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But did suffer from, sort of, like weird M.S.X. scrolling and movement. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this was the FamiCom version we're playing today. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then in October 1988, Sega released this one (a port) for the Sega Master System (again with altered graphics and completely different character portraits). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And some of the game layout was changed a bit as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This version even came out in the States. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Surprisingly English version for DOS also emerged in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again with completely reworked graphics and really bad sound. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All these were [pretty] similar and presentation for the most part. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A huge step forward came in 1988 when alpha system developed these books one and two for the P.C. Engine and TurboGrafx C.D.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this was a brand new intro. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's more in-game story, there's all these fancy cutscenes, some voice acting was used. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the hugest upgrades in the music and the fact that it combined both "Ys" and a sequel "Ys II" into one game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is -- (I'd say) is in many ways the definitive version of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, all the in-game portraits have been changed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, as we know this one came out in English as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, despite this being so good, newer versions did eventually appear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ys" went high-res in 1991 when it was released for the Sharp 68000 computer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, I'll admit, I don't like the graphics and the character portraits are absolutely terrifying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, again, the big chunk of the game were changed around quite a bit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then another [pretty] substantial reworking occurred for the Sega Saturn on the Falcom Classics discs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll leave that chick on the title screen looks a bit sexier now. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, the graphics were completely changed but the music doesn't seem that impressive. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now all this is well and good but I'd say that far and away the, uh, the best version out there (other than maybe the P.C. Engine one) is the "Ys Complete". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, it has new graphics, good music, more story content, cutscenes, animated intro, very nice looking game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is for Windows. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bob has been changed very cool and beautiful 2D sprite work. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was never-released outside of Japan but an excellent unofficial English patch does exist. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you know after this welcome never stops. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This later came out for the PlayStation 2 Japan, and more recently reached cell phones and the DS. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Though the D.S. version was, from what I understand, considered somewhat flawed.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's probably a few that I missed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There probably been more ports and re-releases of "Ys" than there have been actual sequels. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Ys (Review Resumes) ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, speaking of flawed, the FamiCom version isn't really that hot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was ported by an Advanced Communication, same guys who did "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's not surprising your character moves sort of stiffly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Often had difficulty correctly entering doors is one like lineup correctly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your character moves slowly in all the earlier versions, but he seems do less damage and take more damage than some of the Computer versions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Making Leveling Up take much longer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As much as I like "Ys", I don't really care for this particular version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we'll save a more thorough discussion until we happen to reach it in 'Chronturbo'. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kame no Onaeshi: Urashima Densetsu 🇯🇵 // Xexyz 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 26 🇯🇵 // 1990 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atlus 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson 🇯🇵 // Hudson Soft 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have here a new Hudson Soft game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's been a while since we've seen new FamiCom game from them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Come a no longer ha who Rashida Densetsu" (which means something like turtles gratitude legend of Tsushima). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The opening sequence shows or Shima rescuing said turtle, who I guess choses gratitude by giving him a spacesuit and sending him on some kind of galactic rescue mission. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Who's this urashima guy and what's with the turtles? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, Lucia mataro is a figure from Japanese folklore. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Suffice to say that he rescued a turtle and got to go underwater and meet the sea Princess and that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, the name over Shima and the opening sequence were stripped from the U.S. release and the title was changed to the nonsensical-sounding "Xexyz" (just a wild guess on the pronunciation there). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, there's a turtle in the title sequence and the game itself seems to be about the same. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still full of seafood monsters and fairies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyways, "Xexyz" starts out rather dickishly by dropping enemies directly on top of you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you're a "Xexyz" neophyte, like me, you'll probably lose half your Life Bar trying to get out of these guys' ways and shoot 'em. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Xexyz" also has a hell of a lot of doors to enter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Within the first few minutes, you get some plot info, weapons upgrades, new weapons, items shop, mini-Boss, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thus you spend more time on the first level entering the various rooms than you do actually, you know, shooting enemies and platforming on the main level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If this seems just a little out of whack, well, I guess almost everything in this game feels a little off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Do those weird half hearts doors or mind dueling thing? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the very similar doors and "biosensing dan"? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well turns out that Hudson hired Atlas to work on this, and this does seem [pretty] reminiscent of their earlier game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They also shoehorned in some weak Shoot-'em-Up segments and will try to countered some rather suspicious deaths. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Watch this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wait, what killed me? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's see it again in slow-mo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No enemy projectiles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Somehow I pass through the platform and then Blam. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Normally you can touch the platforms, but I guess at the edge of the screen, they suddenly become deadly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seems like a programming bug to me. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the end of each two-part level, you hop on a flying saucer and fight a gigantic boss, which generally look [pretty] cool. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After defeating these guys, a Princess will thank you, offer you a weird sea creature vehicle to ride on, and then you'll flop to the next island. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But first there's another Shoot-'em-Up sequence, you face another boss, and then you land on the island to start the next level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game can be visually creative at times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like here, for example: You rescue a Princess from mini-Boss who has seemingly frozen in her in her bathtub. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After beating the mini-Boss she then thaws out, even wearing a shower cap. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, in strictly visual terms, "Xexyz" rates [pretty] highly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each level (at least the outside parts) has its own unique look and feel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The indoor parts seem a bit more similar, but there's still lots of different enemy types. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yet to me, the game just doesn't feel quite right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your jump is [pretty] weird and hard to get used to. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It makes certain platforming sections [pretty] damned irritating. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enemies are often hard-to-hit and can take too many hits to kill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you die you start off back in the very beginning of the level with a crappy weapon and you had to find an Item Shop and then buy a better weapon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The same, sort of, problems are actually true with the Shoot-'em-Up parts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have speed and power-up capsules, but even powered-up your ship is still super lame and boring. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's just too damned hard to kill the enemies coming atcha. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like here I'm shooting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why doesn't anybody die? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All in all, the games start to feel [pretty] tedious [pretty] quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A shame because with a bit of work, this could have been really good. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm gonna classify this as a near miss. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Dyna'mix Badminton 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 26 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Pax Softnica 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by VAP 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh boy! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you thought "Konamic Tennis" was less than thrilling, how about "Super Dyna'mix Badminton"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And why is there an apostrophe in 'Dyna'mix'? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's supposed to indicate a missing letter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is just randomly inserted between two syllables. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Unless it means we're supposed to pronounce the name 'Super Dyna-Mix'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, as you see, the game was published by VAP, the guys behind "...Super Monkey Daibōken". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is, uh, not promising. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you choose between Coat 1 through 4. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This changes the background, so let's assume they mean 'Court' instead of 'Coat'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here's the funny thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can choose to name boy or girl as your player. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The cover art even shows a cute blonde girl whose skirt is being lifted up exposing her backside. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you might think that VAP is going for like a sex appeal angle, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But nope, no one even bothered to draw a female sprite. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have the exact same character for either sex. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The [only] difference is the game length. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this was developed by, uh, Pax Softnica, whose other credits include working on Nintendo's "Ice Hockey". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently they didn't learn how to design a good Sports Game, since "Super Dyna'mix Badminton" is [pretty] dire. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even more so than most Tennis Games, you have to completely ignore the ball (or shuttlecock in this case) and focus entirely on the shadow. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have no way of knowing if you're going to hit the shuttlecock if you don't look at the shadow instead. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then, even then hitting it is tricky. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to be really close to the shuttlecock in order to hit it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, if you look at the demo, it appears they're hitting the shuttlecock once it's actually behind their backs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm sure that with some practice, you could overcome the game's peculiarities and master it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But unless you're some sorta huge badminton fan, you're better off playing something like "Super Dodgeball" instead. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 FamiCom Meijinsen 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SNK 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by SNK 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well SNK shows up again with "FamiCom Meijinsen", which is a 'Shogi' Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It has a [pretty] decent title screen! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Meijinsen', by the way, is a pro 'Shogi' tournament. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now I don't know who developed this, since programming the AI on something like this is a little different than what's usually required for most video games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Certain developers tend to specialize in the arcane knowledge required to make a good Chess or a good 'Shogi' game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So maybe SNK brought in outside assistance for this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have all the usual options 1-Player, 2-Player, Tournament. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can watch the FamiCom play itself, you can choose among several different players, and there are some instructional scenarios to improve your skills, supposedly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you know, just like Mahjong, I don't play 'Shogi' myself, and I have no way of judging the quality of the game other than on completely superficial criteria. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shogi, as you may recall, is a distant cousin of Chess and plays somewhat the same as Chess does, [only] the pieces tend to move up quite a bit differently. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If anyone out there is actually a decent 'Shogi' player, hey, then give this game a try and leave your thoughts in the comments on the 'Chrontendo' blog. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Matou no Houkai: The Hero of Babel 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Carry Laboratory 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, we have the first of three Pony Canyon game today, "Matou no Houkai: The Hero of Babel" (which might be translated as 'Collapse of the Demon Tower'). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one was never released in the U.S. (for good reason, as we'll see), but note the developer's name right there on the title screen, Carry Lab. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A semi-obscure Japanese software company. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've actually seen one of their earlier games already, "Mystery Quest" (one of the more blatantly Mario-inspired games for the FamiCom). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It wasn't a terrible little game, just not very original. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So how does "Matou no Houkai..." hold up? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it, sort of, fails in the originality department. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems to be inspired a little (no no, make that a lot) by "Castlevania II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The tower looks very similar to the castles from that Konami game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the similarity actually goes a bit further than that, I'm afraid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And maybe there's also a bit of "...Zelda" thrown in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Notice that you have Experience Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Every hundred points or so you gain a level in your Life Bar goes up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's where we, sort of, come to the first sign of trouble. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're like, maybe a minute in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need a key to leave the first area. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In order to get the key you need to find the (wait for it) -- the Holy Water, which is available inside that very first room we come across. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you can't get the Holy Water until you have 50 Experience Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, first thing in the game we need to start grinding. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This would go by much faster if those little blue blobs actually respawned more frequently. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so we got 50 Experience Points; we'll go in and get the Holy Water... which is used to put out the torches. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, unlike "Castlevania", you can't destroy the torches with irregular weapon you have to throw Holy Water at them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 WP is consumed when you use the Holy Water (or other Special Weapons). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's just like the hearts "Castlevania". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot of times, the torches will actually drop WP refills as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game has the annoying habit of making enemies, sort of, materialize right where you're standing... or even dropping them on you from the ceiling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, you take a lot of really cheap hits in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now I should point out these levels look bigger than they really are. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The screen wraps around from left to right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So when you see what looks like multiple doors on one particular level, that's really just the same door. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The levels are very small, horizontally speaking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, for the record, how can a chest drop out of a torch? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I assume that was laziness on the developers' part. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They didn't want to draw unique sprites for each item you pick up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's just a generic chest sprite instead. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You frequently get luck increases in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I have no idea how the game mechanics actually work. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the game gives you a very high Luck Stat (not that it seems to have any effect on combat). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here's the first boss and, uh, Wow! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this guy is actually much more awkward than fighting Death in "Castlevania". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 He flies around the ceiling a lot, but occasionally he'll materialize down where you can actually reach him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you moved so slowly that he's usually gone by the time you get to the other side of the room. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think the [only] way to kill him is either by luck or memorizing where he's going to appear and then start walking there early. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you can be standing right next to him when he materializes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So that's "Matou no Houkai" in a nutshell - a lame "Castlevania" ripoff that manages to make your character away stiffer and slower than even Simon Belmont. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kick and Run 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 13 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoa, they just sorta ripped off the baseline from "Sunshine Your Love" there in the first couple seconds of that musical theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Kick and Run" for the F.D.S. from Taito. Whoopie. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In past episodes, I've complained about Taito's lack of interest in creating any good original console games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that really isn't going to be remedied today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Kick and Run" is, once again, an Arcade port of a not too terribly exciting Soccer Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have your usual options: You pick a country, game style, number of players... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You [only] have two game types, Tournament or, uh, Kicking Practice. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Little animation of players running out in the field and there you go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the original Arcade Game was already two years old. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And really isn't in the same class as something like "Rainbow Islands" or even "Wardner no Mori", in terms of memorability. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really just a plain old Soccer Game with cute graphics. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One nice touch is the way the players react after a goal. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The goalkeeper or pounders hit on the ground or kick the goalposts. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game actually plays a lot like "Soccer League Winners Cup". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (That was the Data East game we saw last episode.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hell, after playing this, I might even be tempted to call "Winner's Cup" a "Kick and Run" clone. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All in all, "Kick and Run" just sorta handles better than "Winner's Cup". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really not that bad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose it's a decent, no-frills Soccer Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Maniac Mansion 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 13 🇯🇵 // 1990 September [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by LucasFilm Games | Jaleco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, this next one, sort of, weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's "Maniac Mansion" from Jaleco - based, of course, on the Lucasfilm's groundbreaking 1987 Computer Game - the game that was first in a run of a series of really great point-and-click Adventure Games from that particular company. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start, as always, by choosing your characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Guess these three are as good as any. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this, we have the standard animated intro of the viewer crashing outside the mansion, and then the music starts up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then it gives you the original game's credits. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then we get a scrolling title screen that ironically shows the chainsaw being used. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ironic because the chainsaw is [only] in the game to tempt you; it can't actually be used. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, you say, 'Well, there's nothing weird about "Maniac Mansion". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I played this game on the N.E.S. all the time when I was a kid.'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, but the odd thing is, the Japanese "Maniac Mansion" is completely different than the one that was released in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the version that everybody knows and loves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was done by LucasArts and Real-Time Associates in 1990. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The graphics and music are all completely different from the Japanese release. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now we have the Japanese version again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Maniac Mansion" was ported for the system twice - each version completely independent of the other (something that doesn't happen very often). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese version seems [pretty] faithful to the original. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Seen here is the, uh, DOS version.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You use the words in the menu to build commands. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, clicking on 'Use' and then 'Key' and then 'Door' will unlock the door. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, for the Japanese game, some graphical changes have occurred. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rooms such as the kitchen (that take up several screens in the original game) are now [only] one screen in size. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the Japanese don't like scrolling and their Adventure Games or maybe it was just easier to make. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The commands have been simplified a bit from 15 to 12. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have open, push, pull, go, friends (meaning, you know, new kid) Close, use, read, give (or transfer, maybe), take, turn on, and turn off. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In some ways, this is actually more faithful to the original than the American N.E.S. game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The statue (which Nintendo of America didn't like) was removed for the U.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here it's still in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is not terrible by any means. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though the characters all look, sort of, the same. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They lack the individuality found in the American versions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's still an interesting side note to the "Maniac Mansion" story. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Konamic Sports in Seoul 🇯🇵 // Track and Field II 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 16 🇯🇵 // 1989 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami game numero tres! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How do they keep pumping these things out? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know, but here's another 'Konamic' Sports Game: "Konamic Sports in Seoul", this game was clearly designed to coincide with 1988 Olympic Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I bet you didn't know Konami had their own airline, now did you? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It starts off with the typical Konami animated intro, including an excruciatingly long March. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This thing just goes on forever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, in the U.S. this was not released until next year, well after the Olympics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami ended up releasing it as "Track and Field II", which makes sense since the U.S. version of the first game was called "Track & Field" instead of "Hyper Olympic", as it was called in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a couple of different modes, but the game really works much like the first "Track & Field" meaning there's going to be a lot of button mashing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everything, however, has been graphically overhauled with more modern-looking bigger characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll just go ahead and run through the events, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fencing is, sort of, a very simple Fighting Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can block and attack high, low, or middle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What you're trying to do here is hit your, uh -- your opponent five times in order to win (of course, without hitting you first). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Diving game is really simple! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You just jump off, hit Left or Right on the D-Pad while hitting a button, and you'll do some spins and jackknives. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually [pretty] hard to lose, but it's a bit trickier to get to get get a good score. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe when you land in the water, you'd have to be as straight as possible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's a matter of timing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Shooting Game is a bit more difficult, especially when the clay pigeons are fired at extreme angles toward the left or the right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You won't always have time to get your crosshairs over to the side in order to get a good shot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, with practice and some luck, it's really not that tough to qualify. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taekwondo is, once again, sort of, a Fighting Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can duck, jump, punch, and kick. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Playing against the CPU, however, it's [pretty] darn easy to, sort of, spam with kicks and eventually you'll win. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Pole Vault is, in the grand "Track & Field" tradition, a button masher. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Press the A button as fast as you can to build up speed and then B twice to perform the pole vault. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can run fast enough this is incredibly easy to qualify. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Canoe event probably has the controls that are hardest to get used to. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All you really have to do is navigate your canoe through a series of gates within a certain time including some gates where you have to pass through going backwards or loop around and go through the other direction. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The controls work a little differently than you might think, but one to get used to them, it's actually [pretty] easy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Archery is [pretty] cool! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to adjust the angle of your bow (both Up and Down, Left or Right), based on things like wind direction and wind speed as well as the distance to the target. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then, uh, button mash to fill up your Power Meter and go! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the Hurdles event. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The competitors look like women in this one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, it's just straight button mashing with timed jumping. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is one of my least favorites. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like Diving, you need to execute a series of tricks using button presses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though the score you get seems, sort of, arbitrary. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I got low scores a few times and then and then suddenly got a higher score than last time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No idea why. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Triple Jump this is the same guy from the Pole Vaulting game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just like Triple Jump from the first "Track & Field". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It requires some button mashing to build up speed and then a few time button presses to do the jumps. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The key is to get going really fast and when you jump, don't do it at too high an angle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise you just won't get enough horizontal movement. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is my least favorite right here - the Hammer Throw. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To build up power, you need to do quickly press on the D-Pad while rotating in a counterclockwise direction. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, you're rubbing your thumb really fast in circles on the D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The friction will cause your thumb to heat up quite a bit so this game is definitely the most uncomfortable on the hands. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And finally Swimming. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is another button masher, [only] it's A and B alternately this time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also a 2 Player-[only] Arm Wrestling Game (which isn't an Olympic sport, as far as I know). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, there you have it - "Track & Field II" - really just like the first "Track & Field" [only] with fresher graphics and some new events! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Reigen Doushi 🇯🇵 // Phantom Fighter 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 16 🇯🇵 // 1990 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Marionette | SRS 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 // FCI 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We are approaching the end of today's episode, but we still have two more Pony Canyon games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first one is "raging Doshi". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not quite sure how to translate the title, but as you can see here, the game involves jianchi (Chinese hopping vampires). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, take a look for the Paragon Films credit on the title screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, for some odd reason, this actually got a U.S. release under the name "Phantom Fighter". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though I really don't think it made much of an impression over, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've never even heard of it until I did this episode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kanji, by the way, is the Japanese name for a jianchi. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have a main town area, which has many doors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each will lead you inside a building and will usually contain a vampire. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Before you enter the room, you actually do have the option of getting a little message that tells you what's inside. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game then becomes a mini Fighting Game (granted a very slow paced one). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The character is very weak at the beginning of the game, and is virtually evenly matched with the vampires. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After defeating a vampire, he'll burst into flame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in the case of this building the temple where we are here, your health will be refilled. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They'll need to return to the temple frequently to refill your Health Meter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, this is the [only] place where you can refill your Health Meter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, unfortunately you can't just leave a room. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to talk to your assistant and choose a 'Leave' option out of the little menu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this gets aggravating real fast. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So does having to walk all the way back to the temple every time you want to refill your health. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the last vampire game we saw, "Qian Season Two", was based on a low budget vampire movie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it turns out that "Regan Doshi" is the official game adaptation of the greatest Chinese vampire movie ever, "Mr. Vampire", which was titled "Reagan Doshi" in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This 1985 when we kicked off the whole Action Horror Comedy genre in Hong Kong, and made a star out of lamb Ching, who plays the spirit-busting priest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your character in the game is based on lamb. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game's opening animation is even taken directly from the movie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a scene with a vampire burst out of his coffin. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, don't be confused by the very similarly titled "rakin Doshi", an Arcade Game, which is copyrighted in 1988 as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This oddball game was apparently the first Fighting Game to use digitized graphics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it does have a jianchi theme, but it's really completely unrelated (at least officially) to the FamiCom game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Phantom Fighter" as a game can't really even come close being awesome as Mr. Vampire is is the movie, but it's not really terrible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is [pretty] simple and straightforward. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Entrance doorway on the street by vampires and pick up an ancient scroll afterwards. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some rooms were a party to fight multiple vampires in a row, and your award will be these red jewels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you have all three red jewels, you can then head to the cave it into the street and fight a special boss vampire. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then move on to the next town. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what are the ancient scrolls for? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, they actually serve as form of currency in the training halls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Using the by improved combat techniques, such as double punches and kicks and things like the wolf move, which is just an increase in speed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the game resembles something like "Double Dragon" where you gradually improve on your combat as the game progresses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, you actually have to answer some goofy trivia questions in order to enter the training Hall. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So again, Phantom fighter is a decent if not exactly thrilling game,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like several other Pony Canyon games ("Dr. Chaos" being one), it was developed by Marionette and SRS. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 According to the Game Developer Research Institute, Seishi Yokota from SRS design a graphics of both this and "Dr. Chaos". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they do actually have, sort of, a similar feel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While this doesn't exactly follow the plot of the movie, Mr. Vampire, your character is recognizable as lambing chains, Dallas priest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And even Louis subplot concerning that took a dislike ghost find its way to the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It certainly seemed worse games based on movies. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kujaku Ou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Graphic Research 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting how so many seemingly obscure Japanese releases, this episode, are either available as official Western releases, or have English translation patches. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's the case with this game, right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Kujaku Ou" (or '"Peacock King"'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Never-released outside of Japan, we do have a translation, courtesy of snark. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the temple being struck by lightning was no coincidence but indicative of some sort of evil, supernatural forces. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You peacock are sent out to investigate. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You naturally hit the beach and start looking around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's the first thing you always do when investigating some sort of supernatural activity, right? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, head to the beach. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Kujaku Ou" is clearly a standard "Portopia..."-style Adventure game, but it does actually throw in some rather hastily conceived R.P.G. elements (namely the turn-based combat). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In certain areas, you'll encounter a monster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most of these, um, encounters are unavoidable battles at certain set places. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I guess sometimes enemies appear, sort of, randomly in certain areas. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Tombs & Treasures" from last episode, combat's [pretty] darn simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And normally just consists of hitting the fight button over and over again, except for certain boss-like enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You actually have Hit Points and Magic Points (or C Points, as the game calls them). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the game doesn't even bother to display them on the battle screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mostly though, you just spend time looking around until something appears, talking to people, which opens up new dialog options and areas and then moving on to new areas and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first guy you meet will tell you about the mayor and the mayor will tell you about the morgue. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you'll find a large suspicious fishscale on the body, that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The fact of the game, sort of, casually throws around lots and lots of names and places and the opening act might make you think it was based on an existing work, which is correct. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Kujaku Ou' was a manga series, which was made into two movies in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first was this typical anime deal (sometimes known also as "Spirit Warrior"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much more surprising was the live action film, a Japanese Hong Kong co-production that starred none other than "Kung-Fu" movie star u and v. o. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And associated Sammo Hung, who even had an appearance and Mr. Vampire. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On a side note, "Peacock King" was directed by lamb boy, who later made an extremely infamous movie called "The Story of Ricky". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might recognize this particular scene, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was incidently also based on a manga. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, there were also some more video games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... "Kujaku Ou" for the M.S.X. was released almost simultaneously with the FamiCom game and appears to be exactly the same game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even the graphics are almost identical. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, we have the Sega Master System "Kujaku Ou", released about a month later by Sega. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one actually came out in the U.S. as "SpellCaster". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The intro makes it look like we're going to be playing the exact same game, but it turns out to be an Action Game instead. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there were also some sequels a little later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Going back to fighting the topless demons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the game tries to recreate some of the horrific aspects of the comic, which is full of all kinds of geeky demons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the game gets more interesting later, I mean, granted does have things like flushing mermaids, but for the most part, it seems [pretty] darn tame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game does suffer from an overall, sort of, low budget vibe. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, after the game's first act, we get sorta this "Final Fantasy"-style delayed intro (which features all this really ugly and indecipherable imagery). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe this would make sense to fans of the comic, but to me just looks like a bunch of ugly graphics. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As mentioned, the Adventure Game elements are [pretty] basic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You just, sort of, look, talk, and move for the most part. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not always clear what to do, but is more due to general bad design rather than a, sort of, puzzles which are difficult to solve. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you reach a dead end, you generally have to go back and talk to someone again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The R.P.G.-like battle system is also very simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 People complain nowadays about stuff like "Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest" (you know, that they dumbed down R.P.G.s for Western audiences). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But Japan got lots and lots of this kind of stuff as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There aren't any healing items or Experience Points or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your health is replenished and you Level Up and set points in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while it's possible to die, your strategy is simply to use the fight option against regular enemies and pray (that is used magic) against boss-like enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What praying actually does is summon some sort of godlike being to perform a powerful attack, but there's no on screen representation of this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The text just tells you that so and so unleashed a powerful bolt of lightning or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Don't expect any fancy schmancy summoning animations. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It is cool to play this wacky little game in English. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not exactly good or fun, but exists as a fine example of an unusual middle grade Japanese license game. 🍇🍌
