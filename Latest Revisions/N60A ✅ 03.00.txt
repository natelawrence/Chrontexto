👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 60 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey everyone, we have another very long [episode today]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [1990's] been [kind] of a taxing year so far, with "[Dragon] Quest IV", "Power Blazer", "[Crystalis]", "Ninja Gaiden II", [and] now "Final [Fantasy] III". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, things [are gonna] chill [out] a [little] bit after this - [which is] a good thing, since "Final [Fantasy] III" nearly [killed] me. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We [also] have some *[total] garbage* [from] Bandai, *and another [Imagineering]* game, *also* the first entry in a *long*-running Tactical R.P.G. series. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright! [Let's get started]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kurogane Hiroshi no Yosou Daisuki! Kachiuma Densetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Make Software 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nihon Bussan 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey! Let's [start] off [with] the [most] boring game this episode, "Kurogane Hiroshi no Yosou Daisuki!...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And this] is the [second] *Horse Racing* Game of [1990]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And, just like] the first one, [it] uses the name [and] likeness of a real-life individual - in this case, Hiroshi Kurogane. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's him [depicted] on [the title screen]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [if] you remember the "Isaki Shuugorou..." game from ([what]?) three episodes back, [you'll recall there] were tons of menus [and] options [to] go through [to] take [out] loans [and] place bets [and] all [that kinda] thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, this [game] is almost all menus (like, *so many* menus). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This looks way more [complicated than the last] game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Hiroshi Kurogane] is [actually] a manga [artist and not] one [that probably] many people [outside] of Japan [will] be familiar with. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He seems like a reasonably well-respected [artist] who works [in] a [humorous] style, sometimes in historical [settings]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [his] stuff is [pretty different] from the horny teenagers [and] Sci-Fi or [Fantasy settings that] are [popular] among Western manga fans. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He was [apparently] a good friend of Koichi [Sugiyama] and was *also* a *gambling* addict, [which] explains the horse racing connection. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Apparently], he [put down] a [lotta] money on horse racing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, *as* I mentioned earlier, *lots* of menus! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I [was] watching a playthrough [of] this, [and] the guy [literally spent *20* minutes] in the *menus* [before] the first horse race [started]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [So, you've gotta] do a [lot] of [optimization] on [your horses or whatever]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {I} [mean], *look* [at] this! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Geez! [I've gotta] *name* all {of} these *horses*!? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, once you've [gotten your] horse stats all fixed [or whatever], you [can actually start] racing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] here's [the] funny thing; [just like] the last Horse Racing Game, it's [not exactly] visually striking. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's functional, and [it] does also play the "[William] Tell Overture" during the race. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm [kinda] curious now [if] every Japanese Horse Racing Game [uses this] piece [of] music. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I [suppose we'll] find [out] *eventually*? 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryū to Hikari no Tsurugi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Intelligent Systems | Nintendo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Also released] on April [20th], we have "Fire [Emblem]...", the [first] game in a [beloved Tactical] J.R.P.G. series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it -- it's [a beloved] series *now*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Back [in 1990], this game was [not] considered [to] be [that] hot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'Fire [Emblem]' series was [definitely] a grower, [not] a shower. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Over the years, [it] gained a strong following, [not only] in Japan [but surprisingly] in the U.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There [has] never been an official English [*release* for] the original *FamiCom version*, [but] there is a [pretty] slick translation patch. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [we're gonna] check this [out] a [little] bit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The opening intro goes through the various classes [and] such [that are available in] the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And these are very much [rooted] in [traditional] Western [Fantasy]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have paladins, various types of knights, [multiple kinds] of archers, [priests], clerics, the whole nine yards. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The look [and feel of] this game is very much a [medieval] Western [Fantasy setting]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, we have some brief expository dialogue [between] the two main characters, Marth (sometimes [translated as] Mars) and Sheeda (a Princess whose castle [is] being attacked by [pirates] as [the] game opens). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A few dialogue [boxes later], the action begins. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya need [to defeat] the enemy forces [and] take back the castle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, as [you can] see, [we're] on a [little] island, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The castle [is] on the western side [of] the island and is surrounded by pirates. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There're around 14 enemies, and [your] own forces [are only] 7 in number. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But], of course, you [will] triumph because you are [smarter] than a [computer]. (Hopefully!) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [this] is [completely] turn-based. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Ya] move [your] guys around, [and] when you've [completed] your turn, the enemy then does their turn. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Sheeda], here, is equipped [with] a flying horse [and can] travel [pretty] far each turn [and can] move over [otherwise] impassable terrain. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you [engage] an enemy, we go [to] the [combat] screen, [which] is [completely automated]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [and] the enemy each [get] a turn, though the attacking player often gets to attack twice, depending on the weapon (I *think*) and [as] well as their [Agility] stat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once [you're] done moving [your characters], you [can end] the turn and then the enemy has *their* turn. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from [*fighting*], you [can] do other [things], like [visit] the houses [that're scattered around] the [land and get some] hints. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Fire [Emblem]..." was [developed] by Intelligent Systems, who worked on a number of N.E.S. games, including "Metroid". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though Intelligent Systems is technically a [separate] company from Nintendo, [but that] has close connections to Nintendo R[&]D 1. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game was [produced] by Gunpei Yokoi [and] designed by Shouzou Kaga. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Intelligent Systems also [produced] "{FamiCom} Wars", an earlier [Military Tactics] Game, which we [covered] back in "Chrontendo ... [34]". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yeah, [and] this dude, he [just] gives you [10,000] Gold. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [That] seems like a lotta money, [but] you'll [notice that] the enemies [don't drop] money when you *kill* them - just Experience Points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [whaddaya need] money for? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, [mostly] weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Ya] see, years [before] "...Breath [of] the Wild" [and] "Dark Souls", "Fire [Emblem]..." had breakable weapons - specifically weapons [that] have a limited number [of] times [they can] be used. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] you [can actually] see [how] many uses [are] left, [you know, just] by looking [at] the weapon stats. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This [first] level [is *pretty*] simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] enemies [won't] charge [at] you all [at] once, [so you can] take [them] on [in] small groups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing [that] bugs me: These guys [are supposed to] be [pirates, but] on the World Map they look [sorta] like Iron Man, [for] some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The [pirate] boss [will remain] within [the] castle walls for [protection]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you [defeat] him, you have [beaten] the level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Gazack (as [he's] called) is [reasonably] tough [but] can be taken down [just] by throwing [your] guys [at] him, one [at a] time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [as] soon [as ya enter] the castle, the King gives you a [little] speech [and] you [can] save [your game]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like many [Strategy or] Tactics games, this [is] divided [into] smaller episodes or scenarios [or whatever]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some levels [will] give [ya] new characters, like Oguma, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a [total] of [25] levels, [with] the last one [involving] a huge castle [that ya hafta fight your] way through. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I looked up [a complete] playthrough [of] this [and it] was about [22] hours long, so it's a [pretty] damn long game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Now, ya] do [get] a few [totally] badass [dudes] in [your party] in this level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Doga is a tank-ish character [in] heavy armor who [could just] *wreck* some dudes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Characters [can] also carry more [than] one *weapon*, though they [can only] *attack* [with] one weapon during a [battle]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] switch weapons [at the beginning] of [your] turn. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] in [the] box near the [bottom of] the screen, you have these bars [indicating] how [your] stats compare [to your opponents']. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And also] when [you're not fighting], you [can] move the cursor [around] the map [and] check [out] enemy [stats]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the type [of] terrain [that you're] standing on also [impacts your] stats, giving you bonuses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, standing in the forest gives you a [15% defense] bonus. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [game] very helpfully shows you a box [displaying this information] on the screen [for about] half a [second at] the [beginning] of each [battle]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Also], in some levels, you [can recruit certain] characters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [These] guys [will] all have names, unlike the generic bad guys, [and] a [certain] character [will] need [to] talk [to] them in [order to get] them [to] switch sides. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Unfortunately], this dude died [immediately] after I [recruited] him [when] attacked by [multiple] pirates. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And here's [the] thing about "Fire [Emblem]...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can't just] throw a Phoenix Down [or] cast a Revive spell [or] something [on this] guy; he's almost [permanently] dead. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Technically], there is [an item] much [later in] the game [that can revive] someone. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] doing so [would] be [pretty] much [pointless] because [he wouldn't] have been earning experience [for] most [of] the game [and] he [would] then be too underpowered [to] really be of much use. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Permanent] death is one [of] the hallmarks of the 'Fire [Emblem]' series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though if an [important] character like Marth dies, you [get] a Game Over [and] then you [hafta] reload from [your last] save state. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I [mentioned] earlier, another [absolutely] wacko thing [that] "Fire [Emblem]..." does is [making your] weapons wear [out] over time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [So, you'll] need to buy weapons [from an] Armory, which appears on [certain] levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And [unfortunately] here, all [we're] being offered is [just] generic lame weapons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And also, in] the style of the "[Dragon] Quest (F... --) IV" inventory, a [character can only] hold a [certain] number of weapons [and] the character [that bought] the weapons has [to] walk [up to the] character you [wanna] give the weapon *to*, in order [to actually] make the *transfer*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, you [literally] need [to] have both characters in [adjacent] squares. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And while this is (I guess) realistic, it's also a pain [in] the ass. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's another [dude that] you [can recruit] if [Sheeda] talks to [him], though he looks like an *[absolute] wiener*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Fire [Emblem]..." was [not] very well-received upon its initial [*release*], with [Famitsu] giving [it] a mere 26 [out] of [40]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Initially, sales were sluggish, [but] over time [it improved, resulting] in a sequel being [released for] the FamiCom [in] 1992. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Since* then, the 'Fire [Emblem]' series has slowly risen [through] the ranks [to] become [actually] a reasonably successful R.P.G. series. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Fire [Emblem]..." was among [the] very first N.E.S. games [to get] remade [for] the *Super* FamiCom, with Intelligent Systems [starting] work on a 16-[Bit] version [in 1992]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Released [in] January [1994], "Fire [Emblem]: Mystery of the [Emblem]" is a two-part game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [first part] is simply a remake of the original, [and] the [second] half is a sequel [of] sorts. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is reasonably faithful [to] the original, [but] with more colors, higher resolution graphics, [and] some minor gameplay changes (such [as] showing the range [that your character can] *move* on the *map*). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It also introduced] the [*Support*] system, in which nearby [*friendly* characters can] influence a [*battle*]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "...will of Anri the Great has fallen..." 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the [weird] thing is, there was [an] anime spin-off of this game, [which] was [released] in the [United] *states*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "...Gharnef, and death rule half the world..." 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The "Fire [Emblem]..." cartoon [was] the first official 'Fire [Emblem]' *product* [to] make its way *over* here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Princess!" 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "I hope you [have] lots of hay, ['cause] we're [coming] with you!" 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Ah? Ha!" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was followed [in 1996] by the oddball "...Genealogy of [the] Holy War", which wasn't even [originally] conceived as a 'Fire [Emblem]' game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [technically] a prequel, taking place, [like], a [thousand] years [before] the [*first*] game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] this [was the first] game to [introduce] the Skills mechanic, which [are] special abilities [that] characters [could] learn - *almost* [kind] of like *magic*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It *also* introduced] the series' "Rock, Paper, Scissors" [hierarchy] of weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game was [actually] very [popular], becoming the best-selling 'Fire [Emblem]' game [at that] *time*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The [sequel], "Fire [Emblem]: Thracia (Thracia?) 776", [was not] so lucky, selling [only] around [100,000] copies, [probably] due [to] being released very [late into] the Super FamiCom's *lifespan*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This thing [hit] the shelves [in] January 2000, or four years after "Super Mario 64" [and] *three* years after "Final [Fantasy] *VII*". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [That] said, [today it] is a fan [favorite and] was [*critically*] well-received [at] the time ('Famitsu' gave [it] a [35 out] of [40]). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The series then moved on [to *handheld*] devices, [starting with] "...The Binding Blade" in [2002], which had begun life [as] a Nintendo 64 [title]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] was [followed] by a prequel, "...The *Blazing* Blade", in [2003], which (*incredibly*) received a U.S. *release* (the first 'Fire [Emblem]' game [available outside] of Japan). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The U.S. [release] was *clearly* due [to] the success [of] "*Advance* Wars" for the Game Boy *Advance*, which was [also developed] by [Intelligent] *Systems*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Despite] being [released] one day [before] the World *Trade* [Center] attack, "[Advance] Wars" was a *critical* [and] popular *hit* in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [by] this time, the 'Fire [Emblem]' series offered a [pretty] smooth [experience], with tutorials, fancy [battle] animations, the whole nine yards. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After a GameCube and a *Wii* game, 'Fire [Emblem' settled] into a [comfortable] groove [with] a series of D.S. [titles]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First up was "...*Shadow* [Dragon]" (the *second* remake of the original game) done [in] a style resembling the Game Boy *Advance* games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike the original, "...Shadow [Dragon" kinda eases] you in slowly, with a long opening [tutorial] level, [and] lots of dialogue explaining what's going on - a *very* [different] experience from the original *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After this, there were D.S. remakes of "Fire [Emblem] *Gaiden*" [and] the [second] part of "...The Mystery [of Emblem]". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By [2012, the] series was facing [declining] sales, [and] Nintendo was on the verge of [canceling] the series *entirely*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the [next] game, "...*Awakening*", ended [up] being a substantial hit, selling over 2 million *copies*, and [lifted the] series [out] of its cult status and [into] the mainstream, with gallons of jizz being spilled by Western *game* [critics]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] had fancy anime graphics, 3D models, the game threw in mechanics from many [past] games, and (counting, ah, D.L.C. [and] all that [kinda] stuff) it had something like [150] playable *characters*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [2015's] "...*Fates*" was [an] even *bigger* [critical and popular] *hit*, selling over 3 [million] *copies* - a [proverbial 20]-year [overnight] *success*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Oh no!" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] was [followed] by "...Three Houses" for the Switch [in 2019]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [At] the [moment], the entire series is [relatively accessible to] English-speaking *fans*, [with virtually] all of the Japanese games having received fan *translations*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Okay*! so [goin' back to] the *game*, here's the [next] boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He [can] be [kind] of a tough *dude*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [You] *do* have *archers* who [can] attack him from a *distance*, though *this guy* is [actually] *capable* of doing the same [to your] *archers*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Gordon*, here, [got] a lucky [shot] in (a [*Critical*] Hit). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Sometimes enemies will drop weapons, [as] well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Generally* speaking, [*most*] levels have [you] being attacked [from multiple] *sides*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [you often hafta] take care [of] the [nearest] group of enemies *quickly*, so [ya don't get] overwhelmed by [fighting] two groups [at] once. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] *game* does give you *healers*, which [can] be used [to] heal wounded *units*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [There's] also these [little] fortresses [that will] gradually heal you if you placed [your unit *inside*] of them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *[But], of course*, [it can only] hold one [unit at] a time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, [certain] classes can *Promote*; that is, they [can] *upgrade* to a *new* class. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though Promotion is [somewhat] limited [in] this game, compared [to later] games [in] the series. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, here's another [little] bit where [Sheeda can recruit] someone. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Whoa ho ho! "You [can] do anything ya want [to] me." 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hmm! Sheeda is a very kinky girl, [it sounds] like. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [*Eventually*], you'll have so many *characters* [that] you'll need [to] *choose* which one [ya actually wanna] use in a [particular] *level*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing [about] "Fire [Emblem]..." is [that] you [can't] really [brute] force [your] way through [it]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya *[pretty] much* [hafta] think *tactically*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Placement] of [your] characters [is] very *important*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *One [unit* can only] occupy a space [at] a time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no stacking of *units*, like there are [in] many [*Computer* Strategy] Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] you do [wanna kind of] arrange [your] units so [that] *individual units* [can't] be attacked by multiple *enemies*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I [didn't get] too far [into] the game because, *quite frankly, I am [not]* normally very good [at] these [kinds] of [Tactical] *Games*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm [not] really a tactical *thinker*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I tend [to] play *impulsively* in video games, and this [will just get ya] *killed* in "Fire [Emblem]...", unlike "Civilization" [or] something where [ya can] just create more units if [ya get] massacred. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, [while] this [is *probably* not] anyone's [favorite Tactical] R.P.G., "Fire [Emblem]..."'s eventual success inspired [the] likes of "Final [Fantasy] *Tactics*" [and] "*Tactics Ogre*". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If [you're] *curious* [about] the series, [you *might*] be better [served] by [starting] off [with] one [of] the *Super FamiCom* [or] D.S. games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pin Bot 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Alright]! Let's take a look [at] some Western [releases for] *April* - or 'U.S.-[only] games' as I [erroneously] sometimes call them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Many [of] these did, in fact, [get released in] *Europe*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] wasn't all Speccy [and] Mega Drive over there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ooh! [And] hey! We [got] a sexy lady robot, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sure would [like to] bone [that] robot! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Pin Bot" is a Pinball video game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But], unlike most Pinball video games [we've] seen in 'Chrontendo', it's based on a [specific] real-life *Pinball* table, hence the credits for [Williams] on [the title] screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *One strange thing*: [While] "*Pin [Bot]*" was [released] in [1990, and] the back of [the] box has a [1990 copyright] date, the [title] screen shows a *[1988]* copyright [to] Rare, [which] makes me wonder [if] the release [for] this [got] postponed [for] some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the layout of [the] table on-screen is a [little] strange. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] table [is] too long [to fit vertically], thus the camera [will] pan *upwards* when [the] ball [is in] the upper [part of] the table. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *But* you [*presumably* will not] want [to] lose [sight] of [your] *flippers* [while] playing this, so the [screen] is actually sliced in *two*, and [*only*] the upper portion pans up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *lower* section [of] the table is always *visible*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [This is] a [pretty] unusual [solution that] I [don't think] we've seen [before, and] it's made more visually legible by the [fact that] Rare drew the table in *perspective*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [So], you [can] easily see where the [split] is. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I [mentioned], this is based on a [real table] - in fact, a very well-known [Williams Pinball] table [from 1986, which] was *really ambitious* for [its] *time*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] has [a] number of speech samples, and something of a plot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Your] object was [to] travel from planet [to] planet. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The visor thing [can] be [activated and will open] up when you [activate certain] lights. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Rare's recreation of "Pin Bot" is reasonably accurate, though a number of alterations were made. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can definitely] tell [this is] a Rare game because [of those little effects] they throw in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, here on the Game Over screen, when you enter [in your] initials [for] the high score, they took the time [to] add in, like, [an animated] cursor, [which] changes perspective as [it] spins around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A... -- And this is like Rare in a nutshell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It -- It always feels] like their true passion is [creating] clever [graphical effects], rather [than], you know, making a fun game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But "Pin [Bot]" is [actually pretty] decent! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's [quite] a [lot of] stuff going on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [As mentioned] earlier, you travel [from planet to] planet, [starting with Pluto and] ending [with] the Sun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's, [like], a [little] galaxy on the table [that] shows you where you [currently] are. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can actually] get, uh, two balls [in] play *simultaneously*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] the game throws [in] various gimmicks, like a normal ball [being replaced] by a, like -- a polygonal [shaped] ball. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Later there will] be enemies on [the] screen [that can] do awful things [like destroy] one of [your] flippers. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also [of] note: [It] uses [an] eye-catching blue [and] purple color scheme, which [ya might remember] became faddish a couple {of} years ago. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, [for] a while, [it felt] like every album cover [or] movie poster was all blue [and] purple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [So, ya might] get some unintentional mid-[to]-late-2010 vibes [from] "Pin Bot". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Overall, {it's} [not] a [bad] Pinball game, [and] if [you] like [video] game Pinball [for] some reason, ya know, you'll [probably] like this, I guess. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Double Dare 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, hey! [Another] Rare game! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The rate [at], which Rare pumps these things out is astonishing! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Not] a [bad music] track [from] David Wise ([what] there is of [it, at] least). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [For] some reason, you [can only] play [with] 1 [or] 2 Players, [despite] there being [a total] of 4 [contestants]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And [it] appears [that] host Marc Summers did [not] allow his [likeness to] be used for this thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {The} [weird] thing is, though, [that] the host is wearing a *polo* shirt, rather than the tie [and] jacket Summers wore. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Yeah], I [definitely want] a [different] character. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ditch this geek. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, this [dude looks] cool. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The other team [looks like *total*] dorks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Now], there're various sorts of challenges [in this] game, [and] they [mostly] suck. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... [But] this one [is] extremely unfair. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, look [at that] - one -- one try! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Double Dare"'s a [*pretty*] simple trivia game [with] a few unusual [enhancements], as we [shall] see. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like a lot of, [like], trivia Game Show adaptations, the N.E.S. version gives you [multiple] *choices* for the answer, [and] you simply need to [select] the correct *one*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the original *T.V.* show, the team [wouldn't] be [given] any choices; they [just] had [to] know the answer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And], of course, many [of] these questions [would] be [pretty] difficult for [today's] kids. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [the] game's big gimmick is [that instead] of [answering] the question, you [can] pass [it back to] the other team using the *Dare* option, which *doubles* the *stake*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *However*, [that] team [can] then go [right] back [and] *Double Dare you* (which passes [it] back [to] you) [and] this doubles the money *again*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If the Double Dare is [incorrectly] *answered*, the other team [gets] the *money*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here's where the game goes off the *rails*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you are *Double Dared*, you [can] then choose to take the physical *challenge* [instead] of trying [to] *answer*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Which] means you need [to perform] some [ridiculous] task in a [certain period] of time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These often (in the -- the actual *T.V.* show) [involved] *throwing* things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here, [for] example, ya need to throw a [water] balloon into a [basketball] hoop. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of these physical challenges [are] really annoying, due to the game's, like, weird angle [and] speed meters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I never [really] could [get] the hang of using these things. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The [original] Nickelodeon *television* show ran [from 1986 to 1993] and was an [immediate] success. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from the *trivia* questions and physical *challenges*, the show also had [an obstacle] course, [in] which [contestants] had [to] make their way through a number of [wet and] slippery [environments]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As time [went] by, the show became *increasingly messy*, [presumably inspired] by the [popularity] of the green slime from 'You [Can't] Do [That] on *Television*'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In [1993 it was] rebranded as (I kid you not!) 'Super Sloppy Double Dare', and turned into a virtual *orgy* of goo [and] liquids. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The scatological *implication* of the show was *magnified* by the [fact that] the [set] used, like, square [tiled] walls [and] floors, which made [it] resemble a *bathroom*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's almost *Cronenbergian* in its sliminess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] perhaps we might [find] similarities [between] this [and] the performance [art] of the Vienna Actionists, such [as] Otto Mühl [or] Hermann Nitsch. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] I do [actually] *wonder* [if] there [is] some *connection* between kids *watching this stuff* [and] the [sudden popularity] of bukkake porn in the U.S. [in] the [late '90s], early [*2000s*]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Pornographer] Jeff Mike (the man who [brought] the genre to the [United] *states*) says [that] after releasing his first bukkake video in [1998], he was [quote]-unquote "bombarded [with positive] responses", [almost] as if there was [an] existing *audience* [just *waiting*] for this [kind] of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [What] could've [possibly warped] the [*minds*] of *viewers back then*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hmm. I wonder who. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Now, the first] video game [version] was [released] for [computers in 1988] by [GameTek, with exactly the] same box [art] as the N.E.S. version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The DOS version is pretty damn ugly! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] the questions seem a [bit] easier since they focus more on general *knowledge* rather than the very specific '80s T.V. Pop Cultural references in the *N.E.S.* game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Obviously], the graphics [and music are] much nicer [in] the N.E.S. version, [but] the game still [kinda] stinks! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First [of] all, why is my teammate *super* high? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [We're] on T.V., lady; [we're] tryin' [to] make *money*! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Get your] act together! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Here's* a tough one in [*2021*]: "What type [of product] does [Inspector] 12 check out?". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Beats the heck [outta] me! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {It} turns [out it's] a reference to Hanes underwear ads [from] the [1980s], which suggest [that] old ladies [just totally] maul [your tighty whities before it ends] up touching [your] junk. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Is [this] also kind of a [weird] sex thing? Maybe? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The physical challenges [in this] game are [*pretty*] annoying. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As mentioned earlier, there're all sorts of challenges on the T.V. show, [but] the video game focuses [mostly] on throwing things [at] a target. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Cake] Catch, [for] example, has you catching *cakes*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [You] jump off a [trampoline and] try [to] catch a cake [in] *the air*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Many times [it will just] pass [right through your] body like a ghost cake. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think [you might hafta] catch the cake [while it's] above [your] head? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Other physical feats you must accomplish: *Bowling* ([which] is *[pretty] easy*, actually). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also [Putty] Golf where you play [miniature] golf with a [weird]-looking [egg](?). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] *Ring Toss*, which is [*totally*] messed up! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] *rings* have a shadow, [which] is [*completely* deceptive]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Check this [out]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] see the ring in the air above the "*U*" in the 'Double Dare' *logo*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *shadow looks* very close [to] the back *wall*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It looks [like] the ring [is gonna] miss you by a *mile*, but [it] lands [*perfectly* on your] head. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] then this *next* ring looks *much closer*, [but just totally] *misses* you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Rare, you *really* screwed this one [up]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Some [of] these*, though, are *super easy*, like, um... "Pie In Your Pants"(?) in which... well, they aren't even *trying* to [hide] the sexual [connotations, here]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or *Kangaroo* Catch, which is the same as Pie [In Your] Pants [only] you're tryin' [to get] a baby *kangaroo* down [your] pants. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Jesus! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Playing against the computer is] *tricky* because [it apparently] *randomly* gets answers either right or *wrong*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, Dare [and] Double Dare options are *risky* since [it will just] randomly know an answer [that] no 13-[year]-old [in 1980 would] know (like [what] Chubby Checker's [real] *name* is). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Anyway*, I *rallied* [in] the end [and just stomped] these dorks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [After] the game, you [get] the [obstacle] course, and *naturally* Rare makes [this] really *weird*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You *move* by [rapidly hitting] the D-Pad, [alternating between] Left [and] Right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I mean this] causes you [to] move to the right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And [just] -- using the D-Pad like this [just] feels *really* wrong. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I -- I [can't] think of any other game (off the top [of] my head) [that] does this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, like most Rare games, [this is] a weird combination [of elements that feel pretty] *slick* ([like the] *music*) [and] things [that] feel just [completely unpolished], rushed, [or just] plain wrong ([like] the physical challenges [and] the obstacle course). 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dynowarz: Destruction of Spondylus 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Advance Communication 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh boy! Here [we] go! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A *classic* [kusoge] game, a *premier example* of a game [designed to] rip off *kids* (or [at] least rip off their *parents*), "*DynoWarz*: The Destruction of Spondylus"(?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The name [feels exactly] like some long-[forgotten] *toy* line or [Saturday] morning *cartoon* show. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] *no*, this is, [in] fact, a [completely original property, courtesy] of *Bandai*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And, you know], based on [the] *packaging*, [it] looks *promising* - a dude in Space Armor [shooting] a [cyborg *dinosaur*]? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *[That's pretty] badass*! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] look [at] the back - "[giant computerized *dinosaurs*]", "the [deranged] Dr. *Brainius*", "[forbidden robotic] *experiments* on human [*subjects*]", "[Cyborasaurus must] be *unleashed*!"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [screenshots] make [it] look [kinda like] *"Metroid"*! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, [forget] all that! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "DynoWarz..." is the most basic [and repetitive] entry imaginable in the '[walk] to the right [and] *kill* stuff' genre of video game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] I hope [you] like this room because you'll be seeing [it] a lot. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *[Right] off* the [*bat*], you'll realize [that] the *platforming* is [not great]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Ya] go through several *rooms* of this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most rooms have either a few [of] these flying things or a stationary *laser cannon [or] two*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And [there're also gonna] be [some platforms] over a *pit*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Because most* enemies [are in] the *air*, you'll need [to] *jump* [while] firing [in] order [to] *hit* them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *After* a few screens, [you'll] come [to] this robot [*dinosaur*, and] we [get] this *one cool [shot]* of [it] powering up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is [Cyborasaurus, apparently] the most powerful [robot dinosaur] in *existence*, though [it doesn't] come [with] any weapons... other [than your little] tiny Tyrannosaurus arms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Yeah], you [actually] have to *punch* enemies [until] you find a weapon [to] pick up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And you're] *also* gonna need [to] duck a *lot* because many [of] the dinosaurs are [*shorter*] than you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Okay*, so *here* we found a weapon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There're *four* weapons [in] this game, [and] they are *all* very boring. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This one [just] shoots a [projectile]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] this one [is] *worse*; [it] shoots a [rocket]-powered fist [that] moves in a *rectangle* [and] then [*returns* to] you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It *functions*, I guess, essentially like the *first weapon* [but with] a slower [rate] of fire. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also worth [noting]: There are bottomless *pits* and enemies [can] push you [into] them, which will [instantly] *kill* you, [of] course. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have [infinite] *continues* ([as] far [as] *I* [can] tell), [but ya] do [hafta -- to start] the entire level *over* whenever ya *die*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [At] the end of each level, [you have] a boss of sorts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One weird thing [about] these [fights]: The bosses tend [to] move [pretty] slowly, [but often] when you [hit them with] a laser [or] something they [will] *briefly* [speed] up [for] a second. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This [*might*] be a *glitch*; I'm [not] really *sure*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, [the] *boss* [will] always *drop something*, [but] I have *no idea* [what it] *is*, [and] the manual does [not] seem [to] mention it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, for the [second] half [of] a level, you [are] on [*foot*] again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] if this [looks familiar, that's] because, yes, this game [uses] the same [handful] of *rooms* over [and] *over* [again]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [There're only], like, six [or] seven room layouts in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Finally, ya reach the *boss* room [and] this "Metroid"-looking thing shoots [at] you, [and] you [just... shoot it] back(?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you [*defeated*] it (*well, here's* the kicker), you then [hafta] walk *back* through the *rooms* [that] you [just] *cleared*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no enemies, [but] you'll [hafta] jump across all these pits again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] in the [event that you] fall [into] a [*pit*], you'll [hafta start] this section *over* and then re-kill the boss thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, *once [ya* return back to] the *surface*, you *beam out* [to the next] *planet* [and] repeat for the next *six* planets. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And [*here's*] the thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [At] *this point*, you've seen the [entire] game (meaning *all the levels* are functionally [identical]). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sure, the colors [and] *textures* [are] different, [but] they all play [the] same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Going [forward], there are no new [elements introduced into] this game [at] *all*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This [isn't] like "Super Mario Bros." where [ya have] a [water] level, or a fiery level, or the hammer Bros. [suddenly] show up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [just] nothing [but] walking left [to] right, shooting [at dinosaurs]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like [quite] a few Western-[only] games, there is no in-game *mention* of the story [at] all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Everything [is explained *only* in] the manual. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [if] you [wanna] know [what] the hell Spondylus is, you'll need [to] check [out] page 3 [and] learn [that it] is an [artificial] solar system whose [computers have] been infected by a *virus*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This sounds, [actually, kinda] like "*Power* Blade"! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the evil Dr. *Brainius* has sent a bunch of Robosaurs to *Spondylus* [to] stop you, I assume. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Your] name [is] Dr. *Proteus*, by the way. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] I assume [that that] blob-lookin' thing you [shoot] at, [at] the [end] of each level, are... the viruses? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, literal biological viruses [in] the [computer]? [Not computer] viruses? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, [and] by the way, these flying things are [referred] to [in the] manual as '...the Flying [Hounds of Destruction]...'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] the [platforms that] you jump on, those are the '...[Platforms] of [Deception]...'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [this was published] by *Bandai* [but] was developed by none *other* than Advanced *Communication*, the guys behind "*Photon*: The [Ultimate] Game [on Planet] *Earth*", and "Dr. Jekyll [and] Mr. *Hyde*". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] I guess it's [kinda] cool [to] see this k.. -- sort of old-school *garbage* in [*1990*]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This really feels like a game [from] the [*1980s*]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [in] *my opinion*, "DynoWarz..." had a -- [sort] of a "Dash Galaxy" vibe, where they [created] a game [that] really makes no sense, [and] then tried to come up [with some kind] of ridiculous explanation [as to what] the game is *about*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] also has very weird *jumping physics*, [and] the *platforming* is, *far [and] away*, [the worst part of] the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *[Seriously], check* this [out, right] here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing [that] bugs me on a purely [philosophical] level is the [*utter*] waste of *screen* space. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the dinosaur... levels, all the action happens [in the bottom] third [of the] *screen*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All [of] the space *above this* is [not] used [at] all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Even* the flying enemies *[don't] really* enter [this] space, which *gives* [the] game a really archaic feel to it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Even* "Super *Mario* Bros.", back [in 1985], had figured [out] ways [to] use the upper two-thirds [of the] screen, as have [later] games (such [as] "*Castlevania*", "Ninja *Gaiden*", "*Contra*", ...). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But *here* the *majority* [of] the screen *real estate* is [completely] wasted in the [dinosaur] sections. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another [problem] is weapons *pickups*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They all look [kinda] the same, and [ya can't] tell [what] they're [supposed to represent] when [you] *see* them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ideally, pickups should be easily *recognizable*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Think of the Fire Flower in "Super *Mario Bros.*" or the sub-weapons in "*Castlevania*". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In *addition*, two [of] the weapons are [absolutely] *useless*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [peashooter and] the Laser are *really* the [only] two worth *using*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *Launch Fist* is very *slow* [and] has [to] return *back* [to] you [before] you [can shoot it] again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the *Bombs* are thrown [in an] arc, so (unlike the *Laser*) it's very [possible] to miss the [*target*] if [you're] using the *Bombs*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] power these weapons up one [or] two times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] if you *die* you lose [your] *weapon*, which means *that* you [*can't*] screw up a *single* jump when going through the *base sections*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Otherwise], you'll start the *[dinosaur] section* [in] the next *level* with [just your] punching fist. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, a few other things [to] note: [That little] spaceship *thing* [you] see [at] the top [can] be used once per *planet*, [but *only*] in [the beginning] of the [*dinosaur*] levels; all [it] does will [just destroy] everything on screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, *by* the *way*, in the *manual* the [*dinosaur*] sections are [referred] to as [*Dinosaur Mode*] (which makes sense, I *guess*). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] the parts where you're on *foot* - believe [it or not], the manual calls this [quote-unquote] "Man Mode". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *So, Level* 7 is the final level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After [completing] the [dinosaur] section, you once again make [your] way [through several] rooms of [bottomless] pits [and] enemies [that] you [can only hit] by jumping up [in] the air. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing [that's] a [little] funny: The enemies [that] fly around over the pits [can] drop, like, a health [or] Shield refill, [but] you [can't] pick [them] up because they [just] fall [into] the pit [and] disappear. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As [for] the final boss, it's [just] the same virus thing, [exactly as] in the [last] six levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once again, you [just] jump up [in] the air [and shoot 'im]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the game's [not] over yet. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even on [the last] level, [ya need to] go back [through] the previous *rooms*, jump over all the *pits* again, [and] if you fail [to] make a jump you'll have [to] play [through this] entire section again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "DynoWarz..." is [not] *officially [beaten* until ya] go all [the] way back [and] jump [into your Cyborasaurus and] then use the [teleporter platform]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, finally "The End". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The programmer [didn't want to] use 'is real name on this, I guess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] this [last] screen here [is just] like twisting in the knife. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [definitely] one of the least enjoyable [and] most frustrating games I've played [recently], due [not only] to every aspect of "DynoWarz..." [just] sucking, [but] also due to the extreme repetitiveness of the *game*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You essentially play the same level seven times [in] a row. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But, ya] know, [little] kids love repetitive stuff, so [I'm] sure a [lotta] people have nostalgic feelings for [this] game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] if you try playing this [for] the first time as [an] adult, you [will absolutely hate] it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ghostbusters II 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Imagineering 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Activision 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh boy! Another entry from 'the house of [Kitchen]', "[Ghostbusters] II". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Now, before] we go any further along, let's address the mystery surrounding this *logo*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Namely, what's goin' on* [with] the lower *half* of this *ghost*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Is [that] a *foot*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Does [he only] have one *leg*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or, as ya know, cartoon [ghosts are often] drawn [without] legs, having sort of a *tail instead*(?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] mean, [probably] this is *originally* derived from the idea [of ghosts] wearing a... ragged *shroud* or a *burial* cloth. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *this is* the *official* "[Ghostbusters] II" *logo* as [it] appears on *posters* [and] such. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] also does appear on the Ecto-1 in the movie *itself*, [indicating that] the [Ghostbusters *themselves*] were aware [that] they were in a *sequel*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the opening credits in "[Ghostbusters] II" clearly show a two-legged *ghost* with his [right] leg *partially obscured*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Who [decided to remove] the [second] *leg* [and] *why*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I *guess* [we'll] never know. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "[Ghostbusters] II" is [kind] of a... screwed-up game [and it] has this weird attract screen sequence. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] starts off [with] a [little animated] *intro*! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, [not] *bad*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Then [it]* goes into this long demo of the game's *driving* sequence [and] gives you [some] *gameplay* tips. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And this] *lasts* for, uh, a good full *minute*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Then* the game *credits* roll. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] game was [designed] by Dan *Kitchen* (Gary's *brother*) and developed by *Imagineering*, of *course*, published by *Activision*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We [recently] covered Imagineering's "A Boy [and His] Blob" and "[Destination] *Earthstar*". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] then, after the credits, the game's actual *intro* starts *up* where the [*plot* is] explained. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Was [this written] by Travis *Bickle*? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] then [repeats] the *whole sequence* [until ya hit] the [Start button]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *whole thing* is, like, a good three [minutes] *long*, which has [got to] be the *record* [for] the longest *attract* mode sequence on an *N.E.S.* game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And *this] is the [only] way* [to] see the game's *intro* [with the plot] summary. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If [ya hit] a [button at] any [point] *during this*, the game [will] officially *start* [and] you'll miss *all* of this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Okay*, so *once* the game [itself actually] starts, you'll [get] this *monologue* from '*Vigo*, the Scourge of *Carpathia*'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then a scene of the [Ghostbusters descending into] the sewers or the subway or whatever the hell [this] is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Apparently, in] the movie, [the Ghostbusters] have new weapons [that shoot] *slime*(?). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [I'll] be honest; I *saw* "[Ghostbusters] *II*" in the [*theater*] when [it] came *out*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I have not *seen it* (or [*probably*] even [thought about *it]) since* then. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And if you were to [ask] me [to] summarize the *movie*, I'd say, "Well, there's an evil *painting* [that's] going to [destroy New] York, [and the] statue [of Liberty] comes [to] life, and... that's [actually] all I [remember].". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "[Ghostbusters] II" is [what] I [would] call a modular game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It has two [distinct] styles of *gameplay*: One {is} where you walk from [right to] *left*, [shooting enemies] *above* you [and] avoiding *obstacles*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *second* mode is the *driving* sections, where you avoid [obstacles in] the *road* by changing *lanes* [and] *occasionally* having [to] jump over large *holes* [in] the ground. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *[I'll] be blunt*; this game is [*frustrating, repetitive*, and just] plain *obnoxious*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *driving sequences* [remind] me of "*Battletoads*" (though [not *quite* as] bad). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These sections *do [require] memorization*, [and] they [kinda] feel like they were added in [to] keep you [from] finishing the *game* too quickly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are *tons* of [different] types of *enemies* [and] *some'll kill* you, while some [will] merely slow you *down*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] regardless, the sheer amount of [fast]-moving shit this game throws [at] you is [just] obnoxious (like these damn *briefcases*, [which just] move *way* too fast). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *One* way of dealing [with] these obnoxious enemies is by [setting] up a *Ghost* Trap. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I [don't] remember [what] these things were [actually] called in the *movie*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And apparently] this level is set in a [courthouse]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Okay*, here's [another] driving *sequence*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Then*, okay, this is [definitely] a subway. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I feel like I'm back in, uh, "A Boy [and His] Blob". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *So much stuff* [just] comes *rushing* [at] you [in] this *section*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] mean, look *how fast* [that *bat*] is. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Okay! Now* we have the statue [of] Liberty level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is similar [to] the on-[foot] levels, except [you're] attacked [only] by enemies *above* you [and] there's no jumping, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Suddenly*, the game, [like], turns [into] "*Galaga*". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All these [ghosts] move around [in patterns and] you [shoot them] down. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing [that's just], uh, [bizarre about] this level is how [it starts] off [with] these relatively... aggressive enemies who'll [just constantly] swoop down [and] *attack you*, [which] leads to [pretty] much unavoidable *deaths*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] *then there's* much *mellower sections* where they [just] fly overhead [and it's] more like a [*shooting*] gallery. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, [in *most] levels*, when you [shoot] enemies, they *explode* into a [little] tiny bloody [*explosion*]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] here the [enemies] shrink [into] a [little] gray *wisp* [and] *vanish*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a *tiny detail*, [but it] shows [just] how [inconsistent] the design of *everything* is [in] this *game*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It feels like] three [different] games were [designed], then [separately] just cobbled [together to] make one *long* game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Someone* (maybe Frank Cifaldi) said these games [from] companies like Imagineering *feel like they* came [from] a universe where Nintendo [and] "Super Mario Bros." didn't *exist* [and] the gameplay [styles just] continued to evolve from the Atari 2600. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the *movie* [got] a *huge* [promotional] push. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After all, the *original "Ghostbusters"* was Columbia's biggest moneymaker *ever*, [and] they were *banking* on "[Ghostbusters] II" making a ton of money, as *well*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [*Unfortunately* for] *Columbia*, "[Ghostbusters] II" [underperformed at] the *box* office. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "...uh, several hundred people. [And] they [sat] through the [entire] movie; they were there [to] have a good time. There was *one laugh* -- *one laugh* in two hours." 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Still*, there were [multiple different "Ghostbusters] *II*" games [released] on various [platforms, starting with 1989's "Ghostbusters] *II*" from *Activision*, developed by *Dynamix*, the guys behind "*MechWarrior*" [and] "Betrayal at *Krondor*", among other things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *This was much more* faithful [to] the *film* [and] *seemed* more [interested in accurately representing] scenes [in] the *movie*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] also makes use of *voice samples*, scanned [*photographs*, and] *so* on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "We got one!!" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There *may [have]* been a *foot [fetishist]* working on this, *though*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {I} mean, this [is definitely] a very interesting way to depict the Statue [of] Liberty scene. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Also*, [notice] the N.E.S. controller, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though [in] the movie [*itself*], uh, [instead] of having a [regular] N.E.S. controller, [it] was a N.E.S. *Advantage* [that] appeared. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {It's} [kinda] weird [that] the *DOS game* shows a regular N.E.S. *controller* [and] the N.E.S. version *doesn't*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In October [1990], a game called "[Ghostbusters] *II*" was released in *Japan* for the *Game* Boy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] had the [exact] same box [art] image as the N.E.S. game [but] was a [completely different] *game*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] was [developed] by *HAL* [and] featured chibi versions of [the Ghostbusters] walking through various movie locations [and] busting ghosts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Activision* [later released] this in [the] *U.S.*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Also*, we have the confusingly named "*New* [Ghostbusters] *II*" [released] by HAL in Japan [in] December [*1990*]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [This] is [just] an expanded version of [the] *Game Boy* [title], with... six levels [instead] of *three*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was [not released in] the *U.S.*, [probably] because Activision already had a *different* 'Ghostbusters' game released here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And *finally*, Sega [put out] their own '[Ghostbusters]' game on the *Genesis*, which *doesn't appear [to] be* based on any specific ['Ghostbusters' *property*]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But [this] is all [still] clearly [part] of the ['Ghostbusters' *marketing*] blitz of [1989 and 1990]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, once you've [finished] the [endless] statue [of *Liberty*] section, you end up [at] the [*Museum*]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, *ya know*, maybe [I was] a [little] bit too hasty [about] the N.E.S. version [*not*] having any [foot fetish] content. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so another on-foot section (*this time* [through] the *Museum*) [and], once again, all sorts [of] annoying crap is flying *around*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I *should* [point] out this game's *rather* generous *system* [for getting extra] *lives*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every 20 '[Ghostbusters]' logos [that] you *collect*, you'll [get] an extra *life*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] in the second half [of] the game, there's, like, a [*lot*] of these things, *especially* [in] the Statue of [*Liberty*] section. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the on-[*foot] section*, you [can] also suck them *up* by [setting] ghost traps. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, *really, you* [can] rack up [*quite] a few* extra lives if you actively try [to collect] these things. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I have no idea [if this is] something [that's actually] taken [from] the *movie* [but for] the very final level, *each* [of] the four [Ghostbusters] has [to] go through [the Museum] Level, one [at] a *time*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [essentially], you have to play this level four times [in] a row. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, ya know, I [assumed] that "Double Dare" [would] be the [only] *video game* where I'd have [to] bring up *bukkake, however*, well, here we are. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Yep! The End!* 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No final *boss fight; that's it*! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [That] was [also], I guess, [kinda] the case for "[Destination] *Earthstar*". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once ya knocked [out] the last enemy *base*, the game was [just]... *over*, rather anti-*climactically* (no pun *intended*). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Alright*, let's proceed [to] something [completely] *different*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ivan "Ironman" Stewart's Super Off Road 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tradewest 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey, it's our last U.S.-[only] game [for] the month of *April*, "Ivan 'Ironman' Stewart's Super Off Road". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why does [this] look like the Del *Monte* logo? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Published] by TradeWest [and] developed by... (take a wild guess) Rare - their *third game* this episode! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And this] game is [just] *full* of smokin' [hot] chicks [in] *swimsuits*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya *get [to] choose* the *country* ya *represent*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, [note] the *Leland* logos on this screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This 3D [lettering with] the [reflections and] stuff [just] *looks* like [it] was [designed] by Rare. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] didn't appear [in] the original *Arcade* game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [this is] a Racing Game in the style of Atari's '...Sprint' game series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We covered "Super Sprint" [several] episodes ago. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Ya] drive around [in] a [little] track, [which] is [sort] of awkwardly [designed to fit] a rectangular Arcade [cabinet or] T.V. screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *gimmick* is [that] the track [is] full of *bumps*, inclined *surfaces*, [and] *rocks* - simulating the rough terrain of off-road *racing*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [your] truck bounces around, [while you're] *driving*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] go over the obstacles like *rocks* [but it *will*] slow ya *down*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya *win money* [at] the end of each *race*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] you [can] use this to either upgrade [your tires], shocks, [that kind] of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, [your Acceleration] and your 'T.Speed'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Ivan 'Ironman' Stewart was a [real] *person* - an off-road *race* driver who racked up [an] *impressive* series of *trophies* [from] the ['70s] through the [*'90s*] in competitions like the Baja *500*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In [1989] Leland [released] "*Super* Off Road" as an *Arcade* game - one [of] those big 3-Player cabinets. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This [portrait] of [Stewart] is *way* more [flattering than] the one [in] the N.E.S. game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] this also lists [Stewart's] various *racing* accomplishments. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *Arcade game* uses these big blue pools [of water], something which is [completely] missing [from] the N.E.S. version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Also], the [swimsuit] models show off a [bit] more *skin*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *The whole Arcade game* is [obviously] a [lot] more pleasing [to] the *eye*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] this was successful [enough to get ported] to [pretty] much every [Computer] system. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Sensitive viewers might want to shield their *eyes* from this next *image*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, this is the Z.X. *Spectrum* version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Ouch!* 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Various sequels* have trickled [out over] the *years*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Super *Nintendo* [got] a *version*, [and] the *N64 had a 3D version*, there were cell phone ports. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So this game actually had a [pretty] long *lifespan*! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Due to the color limitations, I guess, the N.E.S. version [didn't] have any pools [of water]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But [it] did have the option [for] 4 Players, as the rather ugly *box cover* points out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, the Drew [Struzan]-esque painting [is] fine [but], damn, there's a [lotta text] boxes [and] logos crammed [on this] thing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I [suppose the strategy for] winning this thing is [to] use the Nitro [strategically]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have [several] tanks of *Nitro*, which *gives you* a [sudden] burst [of] *speed*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the *upper* middle area [of] the screen, [it] shows [the] number of *tanks* [that] you have, [and] you [can] buy *more* or (even better) pick up tanks [for] *free* on the *racetrack*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] also pick up extra *money* sometimes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 {It's} [*not*] a bad game, I *guess*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It's just] one [of] those things [that] were [apparently] much more [entertaining] back [in] the day. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Final Fantasy III 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Square 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Square 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, here we are - the last game of April 1990 and one of the last big games for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, we'll still have "MegaMan III" and "Chip 'n' Dale" and "Dr. Mario" coming up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are plenty of cult classics like "Gimmick" or "Little Samson", not to mention Western-[*only] releases* like "StarTropics". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, for the [most] part, the '...Mario...'s, the '...Zelda's, the 'Castlevania's, and the 'Dragon Quest's, and the 'Final [Fantasy]'s - all that stuff is moving to the Super FamiCom (which, as I [will remind] you, is a mere six [months] away from where we are, this episode). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Final [Fantasy] III" was, of course, [not originally released in] the U.S. [but] has been unofficially [translated] several times over the [last] couple decades. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm using the Chaos Rush patch from [2019]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Final [Fantasy] III" returns somewhat [to] the style [of] the first game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Rather [than] having predefined characters in [your party], as you did [in] "Final [Fantasy] II", you choose four [party] members from several classes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] you need to give them names [and] so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It also] brings back various [concepts from] "Final [Fantasy] (I)" such [as] Crystals, the four Warriors of Light, [and] so on, [but it] does add one very [significant] change in the mechanics. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The story begins in [medias] res with four orphans falling down a hole and landing in a cave. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] the first thing ya need to do is give these [little] shits [some] names. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then ya [start looking] for an exit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [*immediately*] come across some [appropriately] disgusting-looking [monsters], which ya need [to] *fight*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you'll then [find] some Potions [and] a Shield. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This came out a [little] over two [months] after "Dragon Quest IV" but the two games could [not] be more different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, "Dragon [Quest] IV" begins with a cutscene, laying out the plot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You then begin the game by exploring [the] castle, buying equipment, traveling to [a] nearby village, climbing down a well, then exploring a cave, and finally reaching the [first] boss. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By contrast, in "Final [Fantasy] III" the first boss [fight] happens about four minutes [into] the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, you [will] have found (in a previous room, uh) an item, which casts a powerful wind spell, which allows you [to take] down this [giant] turtle relatively easily. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After this encounter, the first of [several] Crystals [in] the game [will] appear. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Final [Fantasy' just] loves Crystals, especially *talking* Crystals. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This Crystal [basically] tells ya the world is going [to] end unless you four dudes do something [to] save it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, quite frankly, the Crystal is [pretty] vague [about what exactly you're supposed to] do. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] then we cut to the opening credits [and] *theme* music. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The usual suspects show up here - Sakaguchi, Miyamoto, Terada, Tanaka, {music} by Uematsu, and programmed by Nasir Gebelli. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [at] this point, technically you can leave the cave, but this [wouldn't] be a proper J.R.P.G. if [it didn't] have you searching [for loot at] all times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, let's poke around, find a [hidden] passageway, open up some [treasure] chests, you'll find money (or Gil, as the game calls it) and some [equipment] like a Longsword [and] Nunchucks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, now here comes the [important] part. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Final [Fantasy] III" would've been a [perfectly] fine [8-Bit] R.P.G. if [it just] carried over the mechanics of the first. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But], ya know, what elevates [it] above the 'Dragon Quest's [and] the earlier 'Final [Fantasy]'s and all [the] other J.R.P.G.s [that] we've seen so far is the job system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Final [Fantasy] (I)" and "Dragon [Quest] III" gave you options [to] upgrade your class. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, in "Final [Fantasy] (I)" you could upgrade the Warrior [to] the Knight, or the Black Mage [to] Black Wizard, which gave ya new abilities. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Dragon [Quest] III" you could change class [at] the Dharma Temple, [resetting] you [back to] Level 1, [but] keeping the spells [that] ya learned. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On the other hand, "Final [Fantasy] III" allows [ya to] change [your] class [at literally] any point in the game, as long as you have the [necessary] Capacity [Points]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 New jobs [are] made available [throughout] the game by each [of] the four Crystals. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [at] this point, the [Wind] Crystal has given us the first five basic jobs - [Fighter], Monk, [White] Wizard, [Black] Wizard, [and] Red Wizard. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Winning [battles] gives both Experience [Points and Capacity Points]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Capacity Points are what] you spend when you want to change class. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Different] jobs [can] use [different] types [of] equipment [and cast different] magic spells. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By the way, your [default] job [at] the [very] beginning is the Onion Knight, which is the [absolute worst] job. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [probably] the [first] thing you wanna do here [is] switch [to] something [better]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so once [you've got your party set] up, you'll leave the cave, and head back [to your] hometown, and [speak to] the village [elders], who tell you [that] you now have a huge responsibility to save [the] world [and] so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And], of course, since [you've also found] some scratch in the cave, you [can] buy spells [in] the Magic Shop, as well as some additional armor [and] weapons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Spells [and equipment can only] be [used] by [certain] jobs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And [while ya don't], like, actually lose magic spells by switching jobs, there are some jobs [that can't] use magic or [can only] use limited [*amounts*] of magic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [if] you are a [White] Wizard, [and] you know the Heal spell, [and] then you switch to a [Black] Wizard, you [won't] be able [to] cast Heal [until] you switch [back] to a [White] Wizard or another job [that actually] has the ability [to] cast [that] spell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You don't *lose* the spell, per se; you [just can't] cast it when [you're] in [certain] jobs. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, once ya [talk to] everyone [and root around in] the grass, looking [for] hidden [items], you [can] head out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] there's a lot of [hidden items] in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I [hit] the jackpot, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [before] long you'll find a village where everyone's been turned into a... ghost(?), I guess, by a Genie. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In [this] bar [you'll find] Cid, in his second 'Final [Fantasy]' appearance. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He [lends] you [his] airship, which [just] happens {to} be [parked in a] nearby desert. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once ya [board] this thing, [you're] basically traveling in style. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] this is [just] one of several airships [that] you [get] in [this] game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Final [Fantasy]' loves airships [like 'Dragon Quest'] loves wagons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Final [Fantasy] III" opens up the [World] Map [to] you, [bit] by bit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Much [of] the game [is about] finding ways [to] get [to previously {inaccessible}] areas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here Cid's ship [can't] fly [over the mountains] and [can't get past that giant] rock, [so you're pretty] much boxed in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But you can get [to this] castle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As it turns [out], everyone [at] the castle is [also] cursed by [the] Genie. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He gets around! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] he's taken the Princess to [his] cave. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, [while you're here], you [should, of] course, [investigate] the castle [for] loot! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's [Blizzard] magic, which [can] be [used] by a Black Wizard. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This, of [course, will] cast an ice attack. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As always, the [art] is excellent, with tons of creepy monsters, and all ([or] almost all) [of] the [art] being used is [brand] new. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As [before], enemies [can hit] you [with status elements but it doesn't] seem [quite as] bad as in "Final [Fantasy] (I)" where it seemed like you were [just constantly getting] poisoned [or] blinded. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Genie (or 'Djinn', [as this translation] calls him) uses a bunch of magic attacks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] once [you defeat] him, Sara seals [him with] a magic ring [and the] curse is lifted. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As thanks for saving [everyone], the King gives you a canoe (also found [in] "Final [Fantasy] (I)"), which allows [you to] travel in rivers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Before] ya leave, you [can visit the] Princess [and] sleep in her bed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, after using [Cid's airship to destroy] the [giant] boulder [blocking your] way, you [can] use the canoe [to] reach this mountain. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In a [bit straight out] of "Sinbad...", Bahamut grabs you [and] puts you in [his] nest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Up [to] this [point], "Final [Fantasy] III" [felt] like a standard R.P.G. with its 'village, dungeon, village, dungeon' rhythm, [but] here things start [to get a little] bonkers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll meet Desch (or Dash, as [he's often] called) who is suffering [from] memory loss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 His [sprite] looks confusingly [like] the [Fighter's] sprite [but] the Amano [artwork] is [significantly] different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We then [get in an impossible battle] against Bahamut (who, [in] 'Final [Fantasy]', is a dragon [instead of] a sea creature). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya need [to] Run from the [battle]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And running in this game is [not] fun, since it fails almost all the time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Desch teaches you the Mini spell [for] free, since [that particular] spell is *required*, [in order to progress] the [plot]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, ya [shrink] down [to] Mini size [and] enter the Gnome Village. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] Gnome Village is [hilarious] because the shops [and] stuff [are] all full-size [but] the people are tiny. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And look how] frickin' adorable you are! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, ya need [to] cure this guy and he'll show you a [secret] passage, which is filled [with] monsters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, in mini form, your attack power drops to [literally] nothing, thus [your] best option is [to] Run [from] every single [battle]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Final [Fantasy] III" [can] be [just] a [little sadistic, but] one of the [worst] parts are the Mini sections, [and] there are several of them in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] mean, on one hand, it's very clever. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It completely] changes the dynamics of [the] game [for] these [parts, but] it's also sadistic [because] you are [virtually] helpless [in] mini form [and] attempting [to] Run [from battles frequently] fails, [so] you [can just get] pounded by enemies, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, once [you're out] of that tiny passage, you [can] recast Mini [and return to your] full-size form. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {It} turns [out] you've entered a [pirate lair], though the game calls [them] Vikings, [not pirates]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As always, you wanna [just completely] ransack the place, looking [for] hidden treasure everywhere. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Ya definitely will hafta] purchase stuff in "Final [Fantasy] III", but a [lot of] the best weapons [and] armor you find in treasure chests. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, I [just] found some [pretty] sick spells, here, Thundara and Blizzara. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's how 'Final [Fantasy]' spell naming conventions work. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, Fire, [for] example, goes [from] weakest to strongest as Fire, Fira(?), and Firaga. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They [just] keep adding extra syllables [onto] the word. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The pirates need [to] retrieve a stolen eye from a statue, which [has] been taken by a Rat who's hiding in this temple, however you need [to] shrink down to Mini size [to] find [him]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] this [part, right] here, is [kinda] where the game [just totally starts] punching you [in] the nuts, since you [hafta] run [from] monsters in this dungeon, and then [fight] the [Rat] boss [in] mini form. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] then, when you [fight] the [Rat] boss, you [can] really [only] use magic or [items], because you have no attack power; [you're] stuck [in] mini form. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] the game gave me a random [encounter] one step [before] the boss [battle]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One funny thing, though, is when you die [in] mini form you become [flattened], like a pancake. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [This] is [just one of] those details [that] makes "Final [Fantasy] III" so much fun. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] the job system [is actually kind] of handy [in] this case because [you] can change [all your fighters] to magic users [for] this part. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] one very [critical] thing [about] "Final [Fantasy] III" is flexibility [and not forgetting to actually] use [the] job system. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, you've upgraded [from] a canoe to a [boat] now, so you can explore new lands. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can find] the [Chocobo Forest] nearby, with [Chocobos] making their second appearance in [the] series. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For some [important] plot exposition, we head to Gurgan Gulch (or Gulgan Gulch, as [it's referred] to [in] the English version). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A Gurgan was mentioned in the intro, at the very beginning of the game, [and] they are kind of like monks [or] something who [can] see [into] the future. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And they also give ya the Toad spell, which is yet another shrinking spell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, [you've] got to head off to a flooded tower [and] turn [into] Toads [so] you [can] swim [underwater]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On top [of] the tower, you'll [encounter] Medusa, [for] some reason. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [J.R.P.G.s just] love throwing in monsters [from different] cultures in a [completely] willy-nilly fashion. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 She's not too tough, like [most of] the bosses so far, [and] the game [kinda] lulls you into a false sense [of] security but, um, the bosses [will get] much rougher soon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After she's dead, Desch's [memory will suddenly] return. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And it] turns [out] he's the guardian [of] this tower, and he overslept, so now [it's gonna] blow up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He jumps [into the] furnace [to] fix it [and] so the tower will not fail [and] cause the continent to fall outta the sky. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, so [apparently] the whole world [that] you've been exploring is on a [floating] landmass. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, Desch is yet another character death [in what's] becoming [sort] of like a -- a 'Final [Fantasy' tradition, at] this point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Ya might recall that] a whole bunch [of] dudes died [in] "Final [Fantasy] II". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, keep exploring [the] area [and] you'll [find] this place, where the famous Gysahl Greens [are] grown. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing ya have [to] do here - this dude sells Magic Keys. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Buy about 10 of them because you'll need them way [later in] the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And ya won't hafta] worry [about] having a Thief [in] the [party to] open [locked] doors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And], speaking of Thieves, you [can] sneak [behind] this poor old dude [and] steal the contents of [his] treasure chest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Some] more classic 'Final [Fantasy]' moments here: [This] lady [will] dance and you [can also] play the piano. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And then there's also] a [hidden] passageway [that] leads [to] this person, who suggests [that] you write [to] the Square development team [with your opinions about] 'Final [Fantasy]'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One interesting [bit] of trivia is [that] much of the [work] done on "Final [Fantasy] III" was done [right] here, in Sacramento, California. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nasir Gebelli [apparently] had [some] problems [with his] work visa in Japan [and got] kicked outta the country. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, he [returned] to his hometown of Sacramento, [and] Square [set] up a [temporary] office there [in] town so [that] they could continue work [on] the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Final [Fantasy] III" is, I suppose, one of the city's major Pop Cultural [exports], along with... (I [don't] know) the Deftones [and] the movie, "Lady Bird"(?). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [At] this time, Square had (*perhaps*) too much on [its] plate. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It certainly] seems [that] Square was planning on [releasing] "Final [Fantasy] III" in the U.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This [is] a promotional image, which [certainly suggests] that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] eventually they decided to focus its energies on the upcoming *Super* FamiCom projects, like "Final [Fantasy] *IV*". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And], of course, Square released [an *enormous*] number of R.P.G.s over the [next] couple years [for] the Super *FamiCom* [and] *Game* Boy (like, 7 games in 1990 [and] 1991, alone). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] seems like every single 2D 'Final [Fantasy]' game has [been ported] a million times, but "Final [Fantasy] III" was unlucky when [it] came to ports [and] re-releases. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A WonderSwan version was planned [but] never [completed]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And it] was never even officially canceled; [it just] disappeared [without] a trace. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unofficial fan translations [have been released] since the 1990s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] we did [not get] an *official* English *version* [until 2006], when a 3D remake was [released] for the Nintendo D.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Great, [so now we] finally get [to] see [exactly what] the characters look like. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Instead] of [fat] babies running [around] in their Underoos, they all have, like, these boy band haircuts. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In many ways, this game is [pretty faithful] to the original, however there are a [lot] of [significant] changes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In modern day era [J.R.P.G.s ya can't just start] the game [with] a full [party]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Ya hafta introduce] the characters one by one [and get] their backstory [and] everything. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here you [actually] play [through] the [first] dungeon with a single character. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] feels [like] the encounter [rate] is [quite] a [bit] higher. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But], as [before], the boss [fight] with the giant turtle is made [possible with] a couple {of} Antarctic [Winds]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the Crystal is much less talkative [and] you [don't get] the ability [to] change jobs [at] this point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [fact that] in the original "Final [Fantasy] III" [it], like, [introduces] its [unique] game mechanic maybe 5 minutes into the game - that might seem a [little] weird for audiences in the 2000s (an era in which J.R.P.G.s just require, like, a ton of buildup [for absolutely] everything). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Final [Fantasy] XIII" is perhaps the worst example [of this]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A [lotta] the minor details are the same, however (the [placement] of secrets [and items, for] example). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Ya meet] the second [party] member here, [and], of course, [he] has [to] have a character [arc to] go through. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He [leaves] town [and] you follow him so [he doesn't get into] trouble. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [He] wants [to] enter the [cursed] town on a dare [to] show [that he's not] afraid. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And, apparently], you need [to, like], grind more [in] this game, because I got [instantly] wasted when I [encountered] the first enemy, entering the Genie's cave. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, over the years, [this] version [got ported] many times [to] things like cell phones, the P.S.P., (the, uh, 'Oh Yeah', [as] I believe [it's pronounced]) the [Ouya], as well [as just] Microsoft Windows [platforms]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Finally, in the summer of 2021, Square released a [port] of the original, done [in the] style of the Super [Nintendo] 'Final [Fantasy]' games, [so] you [can] now easily play an official English 2D version of "Final [Fantasy] III" after [about 30] years [since] the [original release]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though [it] does offer some modern amenities, for [today's] spoiled crybaby gamers, such [as auto] battles, a [World] Map, [and] quote-unquote "rebalancing". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One [of] the [biggest] changes is that [Capacity Points have] been [removed], so you [can] change jobs [as] much [as] you like. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's [also] new music ([that] kind of sucks, [in] my opinion) and a font [that literally] everyone hates. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so after [some] more tromping through various dungeons, you'll encounter the Salamander, the [second] boss (who's holding a Crystal hostage, I guess?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each of these four Crystals unlock new jobs, so we get [to] power *up* now. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We have *Ranger*, *Knight*, *Thief*, [and] *Scholar*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ranger (which [probably] no one [actually] uses) attacks with bows, [but] then you have to buy [expendable] arrows [to] use [as] ammunition. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Knight is a [straight] upgrade from the [Fighter]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy becomes a physical attack powerhouse. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He looks like the [Fighter but he] has, like, a cool cape [and] headpiece. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Thief [can open locked] doors [and] steal [items from] monsters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] the Scholar uses books to attack monsters with [and] to cast magic spells. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, [for] the [moment], I'm leaving everyone [but] the [Fighter] in [the] same job. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [in] addition [to] Gnomes, in this game, there [are also] Dwarves, who all say stuff like 'Lali-ho!'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When you [retrieve] their horn, they [will] give you a *ton of treasure*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Just] be aware, a [lot] of armor [and] weapons are specific [to certain] jobs, so you'll find [lots] of loot [that] you [just] can't use [and] will end up selling. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing I *detested* about "[Dragon] Quest IV" was the *inventory*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each character has a small number of slots, which [get] filled up very easily, [and] you'll [often] have to juggle [items] around, [from] character [to] character, when ya need [to] have [an item] transferred [from] one character [to] the other. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] was perhaps the thing I [hated] most [about] "Dragon Quest IV" - the damned inventory system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Final [Fantasy] III" solves this [in] two ways -- or, rather, three ways. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, 1: You have a single shared inventory; [items are not held] by individual characters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if you have an unequipped weapon [in] the [inventory], any character [capable] of using [that item] can equip it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The weapon does [not have to] be [placed] in their inventory *first*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There [are] a [total] of 32 [inventory] spaces. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'But [wait', ya] say, 'that's [like] -- there were, like, [eight characters in "Dragon Quest] IV". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] they, uh -- [And] they each had [eight] spaces; [that's] twice as many [as] "Final [Fantasy] III"! *Right*?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *True*, [but] here's [the] thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Equipped weapons [don't] take up *inventory* spaces [in] "Final [Fantasy] III". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 When [you're] playing "[Dragon Quest] IV", equipped [items] take up, like, *half* of each character's *inventory*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, there's a huge amount of space freed up by [not] having weapons take up [inventory] spaces. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] finally, the *big* one: Each of the [32 inventory] *spaces* can hold 99 of any [particular item]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, five *Potions* [don't] take up five *spaces*; it takes up *one*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Thus*, you can (*in theory*) have 99 *Potions*, so you *could* carry a [*total*] of 3,188 [*items*] in "Final [Fantasy] *III*" if you [include] equipped armor [and] weapons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And furthermore, even if [your] inventory is full, you [can] still stash stuff [into] the [Fat] Chocobo, who makes [his] first appearance in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Later in] the game, he [actually] hangs [out] on [your] airship, so [he's] basically [an] infinite storage unit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so goin' [back to] the plot here, this guy, Hein(?), who's a very, uh, fashionably dressed ghost sea captain. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And he's] a [little] tough; he's very [difficult to hit] with physical attacks [and] he's [only vulnerable] to one type of magic attack, which [will] change every turn. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] this is, like, the one time where having a Scholar in the [party] comes [in] handy since he [can] *scan* Hein [and] tell [ya what his] current [vulnerability] is. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [After] this, [the] game [will] throw a *big* switcheroo [at] you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, once [you get] this special [part for] the ship, Cid [will] turn [it] into a combination ship/airship. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And at] this [point] you [can get] on the airship, fly [into the] clouds, [and] leave the floating island, [and] enter [the] real world. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You [don't] have a World Map [in this] game [but you] do have a Sight spell, which shows you [your immediate] surroundings. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so once [ya find] this [specific little] island, here, you [can] look [for] the 3rd Crystal - the [*Water*] Crystal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But ya] need [to] rescue some chick named Aria [first]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And], yeah, we have a -- another [dramatic] death, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Alright]! Next up, we [hafta fight] the 3rd Crystal boss, Kraken, who's [not that] tough. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Killing him causes, [like], a big earthquake [to] happen, and you wake up in [an] inn, three days [later]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The good news is [that] the [Water] Crystal has unlocked new jobs, including the [absolutely] Tank-like [Black Belt] job, [and] some [weird] jobs like Geomancer, who uses Elemental Attacks [that don't require] Magic Points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I have a [lot] of [Capacity Points] by now, so I [make] the very unwise [decision to] change my Red Knight into a Magic Knight, which I [believe] was called a Dark Knight in the later remake of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Magic Knights are great, except [that] they have very [limited] choices [for equipment]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, [at] this point in the game, there are no weapons [or] armor [that] they [can] use. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, one [great] thing [about] "Final [Fantasy] III" [is that] you [can] change [your] mind [quite] easily, [as] long [as] you have [enough Capacity Points]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Most [of] the second half [of] the game is spent [out in this] large world, which has three big continents [and several islands], as well [as] some [underwater] locations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [If] we look [at] a [picture of] the [World] Map, [we'll find that it] looks vaguely like Earth, with two large landmasses [that sort] of resemble the Americas [and] then Eurasia [and] Africa. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] there's also a large island, th..l... --  which I guess looks [kinda] like a mega-Australia. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After [your] airship is [shot] down, [ya] end up here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the main drama here [is that this] King has gone crazy [and] kicked [out his] son, the Prince. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First, you need [to] rescue [the] Prince from these Golden Knights. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you need [to] take him back [to] the castle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The -- The city here has [sort of], like, a unique layout. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's divided [into] four distinct areas on the overworld, and [you'll] find various [points] of interest [in] each [of] the four sections. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Eventually], the King lets [ya into] the castle, [but it] turns [out] the King is being [mind]-controlled by a malicious force. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The boss [battles, up to] this, have [not] been too tricky, but Garuda [will absolutely] *wreck* you if [ya don't] handle the [fight correctly]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Changing everyone to Dragoons [will] be very helpful. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [In] fact, [it'll probably] be [absolutely] necessary, since if [you're] up [in] the air when Garuda hits you [with lightning], you won't take any damage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] there's still [definitely an] element of luck, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yeah, [and] one thing I do like in "Final [Fantasy] III" is [that different] jobs have, like, unique death sprites. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After [defeating] Garuda, the Prince is [restored to] the throne [and] life [returns to] normal [in this] city. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, oh yeah, these nerds build you a [brand] new airship. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll [get] various upgrades [to] the ship [later], allowing [it to] go [underwater] and fly over [certain mountains]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But first up, we have [to] go to Doga's Manor, where we meet Moggles for the first time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Doga joins [your party and] you [are] again [forced to] use the Mini spell to travel through a mousehole in an [utterly] hateful journey to some [kind] of [underground] cave. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've [gotten] all the way [through] the cave, you [are] able [to] upgrade [your] airship and [also] awaken someone named... Unei(?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I'm not quite] sure [what the] correct [pronunciation] is. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I [will admit], the -- the [plot] of "Final [Fantasy] III" ([with] its Crystals [and] prophecies [and] mysterious figures lurking [in] the background) - [at] this [point], I [couldn't really] make a whole [lot] of sense [out] of it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {I} mean, [at least "Dragon] Quest IV" was [not] nearly as New Agey and the characters had some [pretty] well-[defined] goals, like avenging [your] father's death [and] such. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Final [Fantasy] III", the story [just] seems [kind] of like a series of contrivances [to] keep you going from one place [to] the other. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's [not necessarily] a bad thing; [that's actually] how a [lot] of J.R.P.G.s work. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But], compared [to "Dragon] Quest IV", "Final [Fantasy] III" is much more focused on mechanics [and] player choice. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest IV" allows you {to} choose party members, [but] each character is ready-made [and] comes with a specific set of stats [and] magic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Final [Fantasy] III" allows you to add [and] remove magic spells at [your] leisure. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Magic spells are essentially equippable [items], even though each job has [limitations on] whether [you can] cast white or black magic, [or] whether you [can] use magic [at] all. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, I [suppose] you could say there's no '[right] way' [to] play "Final [Fantasy] III". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] mean, [not] all jobs are equal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure folks have played through it with unusual [party] combinations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But using a [party] of, say, two Bards [and] two Scholars would be very difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, since each job [can only] equip [certain items], the game has many, many types of armor [and] weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside [from regular] swords, you [also] have knives [and] Katanas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Magic users have rods, staves, books, [and] bells, [and] then various other jobs [might] require nunchucks, axes, bows, claws, hammers, spears, boomerangs, ([and] -- oh yes, let's [not] forget) harps. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are weapon Shops, [but] the game is very generous with the loot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Many dungeons have tons [of] treasure [chests] containing weapons [and] armor (often very *expensive* armor). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there -- of course, there's also many, many, many [items that] range [from] health [and magic] refills to those that [inflict] status [ailments] on enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In [other] words, there's [just] an astonishing [amount] of stuff in "Final [Fantasy] III". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Odin is] another tough boss [that is] made easier by switching [to] Dragoons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When [defeated], he drops [an item that will allow] him [to] be summoned [in battle]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, we [can] add summons to the list [of] things [introduced in] "Final [Fantasy] III" [that went] on [to] become series mainstays. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so one [of] the overarching narratives in "Final [Fantasy] III" involves finding [better and better] airships. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game world [is] laid out so [that] there're geographical obstacles blocking [your] path [forward until] you obtain a ship capable [of] bypassing those obstacles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, it's now time [to find] the *final* airship. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 To do so, you'll need the help of Unei - a withered old crone who's [been] asleep [for] years. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You awaken her by playing Noah's *Lute*, which you found earlier [in] the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unei is one of Noah's three disciples (the other two being Doga [and] Xande). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Xande is the renegade disciple who [basically started] the whole mess. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Incidentally, Unei gives you a *Fire* Fang, one of the four Fangs [in] this game, whose purpose [will] be [revealed later]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For the [moment], though, they [just] take [up] inventory space [and] you [can't] drop them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The ship is buried in these ancient *ruins*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's some [kind] of archaeological [expedition] going on, but [only] Unei has the power [to destroy] these large boulders blocking [your] path. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [At] the [bottom] of these [ruins], you [will find] the biggest [and] baddest airship, the Invincible. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike all *other* airships, you [can] walk around on deck, and [it] has a [lot] of amenities. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's shops on board and a bed, [so you can] refill [your] H.P. [and] M.P. [at] no cost. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's even a Fat Chocobo on board! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [This is] a very convenient upgrade [and] time-saver since you no longer [hafta] fly to a village or the [Chocobo] Forest [in order to] heal [or] stash items. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In terms of a [transportation device], the [Invincible] has the [ability to] fly over narrow sections of mountain ranges, unlocking previously {inaccessible} areas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First up is Falgabard, a village full of Magic Knights who make mention of Dark Blades. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If [you're] thinking, 'Hey, [am] I finally gonna [get] some Magic Knight equipment?', the answer is 'Yes!' (and [it's] about time). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [First], let's find a sword. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Behind] this waterfall is a hidden cave, [often] blocked by this idiot, who likes [to] walk around on the secret path. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, after [waiting for about] a half hour [until] he finally leaves, you [can] then go down the path and [find] this old dude who challenges you to a fight. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] then [he] gives you the sword when you [*defeat*] him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Magic Knights wield Katanas - the most powerful swords known [to] man. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [could also] buy [some] *Demon* Armor [for your] Magic Knight in the shops. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Magic Knight is a [pretty] great [Fighter] who [can] also cast [a] few magic spells, and he'll be useful, up [to] the final area of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Unfortunately, your] joy [will immediately] turn [to] tears when you enter this [next] dungeon because the monsters in this cave [will split] in two [if] you attack them [with] conventional physical weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Only] magic spells or the Magic Knight's weapons [can] be used [against] them, so a [regular Knight or Fighter] is [completely] useless. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I guess I could've [changed] the [Black Belt] dude to a [Black] Wizard, [but that would] mean buying [new] spells [and] armor for him, so I [just sort] of suffered through this dungeon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Your reward for getting through] this cave is [some] powerful [Magic Knight] weapons [and] armor. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, now [that] we've toughened up our [party], we [can] check [out some] other places. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, earlier [in] the game, back when you [were] on the [Floating] Continent, we may have [noticed] a lake [with], like, a dark shape swimming in it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We [can] now fly over the [mountains] surrounding the lake [and] enter [an] underwater cave, where you encounter Leviathan, who [will] also ([just like] Odin) drop a summon spell when [defeated]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you [hated] having [to fight] the monsters [in] Falgabard Cave, you'll then hate the Cave of [Darkness] even more, since it's more [of] the same, except [it's] much bigger and [with] harder monsters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If [you're smart enough], you [can] change [to] two [Magic] Knights, but I was too stubborn [to] do this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Your reward]? The 4th [and] final Fang. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so [what] are these damn Fangs [that] we [hafta] carry around? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, [what] they do (uh, aside from taking up inventory space) is there's this valley, which [is] guarded by some [sort] of defense [system that] looks like statues, which blocks you [from] passing through. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Due [to] some [sort] of mechanism, which I do [not] understand, each [of] the four Fangs [will] destroy one of the barriers [in] the valley. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I now have the 4th Fang, [so] I [can] take [out] the final barrier and reach the final area of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By the way, [did] I mention [that] the Invincible is armed? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When you [get] a random encounter in the air, [it will] begin [with your] ship firing cannonballs [at] the enemy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Invincible is [just] so *cool*! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Entering] the Ancients' Maze [will immediately] lead you to the fourth [and] final Crystal, guarded by the [Titan]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Just like with] the previous Crystals, this [will] unlock the fourth [and] final (wink wink) [set] of jobs. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Summoner is [an] upgraded Evoker, [and] the Warlock [and] Shaman are [updated] Black [and White] Wizards. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This [translation], by the way, is based [on] the modern-day official Square translations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, instead [it] calls them Magus and Devout. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [if] ya were using Wizards [in] your [party], there [is absolutely] no reason [to not immediately] upgrade [to] these two new jobs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And], as a bonus, the Devout's [outfit] is hella cute! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [unfortunately], now comes the game's 'I [hafta] kill Tony Hawk' moment. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unei [and] Doga say [that] you [hafta fight] them, [in] order to [get] the key [to] the area where all the really good [equipment] is kept. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [battle] them, one [at] a time [and], after wasting them both, they [will] hand over the keys to the two areas in the *final* dungeon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, the [last] dungeon [is actually] like four dungeons; it's a *really* big dungeon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, before [ya get started, ya need to get] prepped. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Make sure ya have [lotsa] Hi-Potions [and] various ailment-curing items like Eye Drops to cure [blindness, Softs] to cure petrification (though this translation calls them {Gold}Needles). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Check the [Fat Chocobo for] anything you [might] need. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] any old armor [or] weapons or generally useless [items] should be sold. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [to] be clear, the [last] dungeon is [brutal; it] is long, filled [with] *many* tough enemies, and a *crapload* [of] boss [fights]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's, [like], 11 bosses [we're] gonna [hafta] face [in] this dungeon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the final world of "[Dragon Quest] IV", [there] were, like, I think, [five] bosses [total, and] a couple of [them] barely [even] qualified as bosses. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess this chick is [not related] to [the] dude [from] the 'Avengers' movies? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, once [ya get past] the [first part of] the dungeon, you'll need to use the Eureka Key to enter the [forbidden] land, Eureka. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, [to] me, this name is [kinda] silly sounding, because our state's motto is "Eureka!", [and] we typically associate the word [with] the discovery of Gold. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] there's [kind] of a touristy [little] city named Eureka, up [in] Humboldt County. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's where they grow all the weed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the name [doesn't] have any [connotations] of mystery [or] danger to us, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There is a lot of loot, though. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's the game's first *Ribbon*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's guarded by a Ninja, who are tougher [than] most [of the enemies] we've seen so far. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This Ribbon [not only] has [pretty] good defense stats [but] also makes you immune to status [ailments and] offers resistance [against] Elemental Attacks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, it's the best Helmet [in] the game, with one exception. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There're *five* Ribbons in the final dungeon, [and] they're all guarded by tough enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, as [ya] go through the dungeons, you'll [find] lots of loot, including, uh, the strongest armor [and] weapons, such as the shuriken, which are one-use weapons, which do a lot of damage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll [definitely need to get] a few [of] these, [and I'm basically] saving [them] all up [for] the final boss. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so time for the Eureka boss rush. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] do them in, uh, any order. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I'll] do easiest [to] hardest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Amon is a very swank skeleton pirate, [and he] likes [to blast] the [party] with fire. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He goes down easier [than] your mom after two Midori Sours. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I ended up [not] even using the weapon he dropped. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next is Kunoichi, who is basically just Elektra [from] the 'Daredevil' comics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 She [can cast] some annoying status ailments, [and paralyzed] two of my [party] members. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Unfortunately], I'd neglected to [equip] my Esuna spell, which is [what] cures [status ailments in this] game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But], ya know, there's [just] so many damn spells [in] this game [that it's pretty] easy [to forget] one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] there is no [item that can] clear Paralysis, so I was [pretty] worried, [but] then my Magic [Knight just slaughtered] her the next turn. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Your] reward [for defeating] her is Masamune, the [most] powerful Katana. 🍇

🍁🍊🍓 It has an attack power of, uh, [160], versus [125] of the -- the previous sword I was using, and [it] also raises [your] stats. 🍇🍌


🍂🍊🍓 Third boss is the rather generic General, who [can hit pretty] hard, [but] luckily my stats [are] now [good enough that] I [can] wallop him. 🍇

🍂🍊🍓 The [item that he] drops is the game's [strongest] sword, [but] my Magic [Knight cannot] equip it; he [can only] equip Katanas. 🍇

🍂🍊🍓 However, all that's going [to] change because we [are about] to unlock the final two jobs. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, let's take a moment [and] examine some [of] the other jobs. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Viking [is] a pure physical attack character [with] good defense stats, who uses axes [and] hammers [as] weapons [and can equip] some [of] the strongest armor [in the] game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [There's] nothing wrong [with] him, per se, [but it just] seems [like] the Karateka is [better]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Both the Karateka [and] the Viking are unlocked [at] the [Water] Crystal level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] then, I guess you could go with a Viking [and] a Karateka as [your] physical damage guys instead of the Knight, but [it] is [kind] of a strange choice. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the Thief is [pretty] much useless, except [in] a few situations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He has [an] Escape Skill, which is [kinda] like the 'Run' command, [only] it succeeds more [frequently]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He [can] equip a boomerang and can open [locked] doors [if] you [don't] have [the] Magic Keys. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But generally [not] someone [that you're] going [to] use very [often]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Bard is interesting; he *sings* to attack, [and only] has two weapons [in the] game - the Madhura Harp [and] the Loki Harp. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He has the [ability] to *scare* monsters, actually lowering their *level*, [and] also a Cheer command, which [basically] buffs [your party's] physical attacks, [and] which can be stacked by using [it] over [and] over. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Certain] harps can [inflict certain status] effects on enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Overall, then, he's [an interesting] character, but [sort] of weird. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also very interesting, is the Geomancer, who [can] cast environmental-based attacks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On [just] normal ground he [will] use a Quake attack, in a desert he'll use a Quicksand attack, in [water] he'll do a [Waterspout] attack, [and] so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The bad news is [that] sometimes his attacks [will] backfire [and] damage the [party]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] weird job, actually. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The [Peter Pan]-lookin' dude is a Ranger (also called a Hunter) who uses ranged weapons - bows [and] arrows. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The bad news is [ya hafta keep] buying him arrows. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You use an arrow every time you attack. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The good news is [he'll eventually get] a boomerang and he [can] be placed in the back row [with] no [negative effects], in terms [of the] damage [that] he [inflicts]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Dragoons are cool [for] being able [to] jump [and] land on [the enemy and] do, like, a lotta damage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] they're [basically] a must-have [for certain battles]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've [already] seen [them, of] course, being used in [certain battles] with bosses [that] do a [lot] of magic damage. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Summoner and Evoker are *similar*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Summoner [is just an] upgraded Evoker. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You summon creatures such as Shiva, Ifrit, Zeus, [and] so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each has a [different] type of attack. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, once you have the Sage, the Summoner is obsolete, since Sages [can] also summon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then there's the Scholar, of course. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He fights by slapping people [with] books. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No one ever [uses] him, because he's too overpowered. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It feels like cheating], simply because no enemy [can] withstand the Scholar's book slap. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [that pretty] much covers all the jobs we [haven't] really used, so far. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's [go] back [to] where we were. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy runs a [little] shop where [ya can] purchase Level [8] magic, such as [Meteor] (making its 'Final [Fantasy]' debut, here) and Arise (which [resurrects] a character [with] full health, [instead] of [just] one Hit Point). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A [hidden] switch leads to a [hidden] shop, which sells Crystal Armor, which we [don't] need [to] buy because [we'll] find it [for] free [later]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, this [is] where you [can] buy shurikens, so buy [as] many [as] you [can] afford. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Two bosses [in] this room: Scylla, who [is] actually a sea creature, but here is depicted as a six-headed dog thing with [big] boobs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though there [is actually] some [justification] for this depiction because in some old statues she is shown [as] being [part] dog. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Defeating] her [will] unlock the final two jobs, Ninja [and] Sage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] the accepted opinion is [that] you should *immediately* switch to two Ninjas [and] two Sages. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They are practically universal [fighters and] magic users, [respectively]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ninjas [can] equip *any* weapons [or] armor, [and] Sages [can] cast any [magic] spell [or] summon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] they both have [improved] stats, [compared] to all the other physical damage jobs or magic jobs. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Alright, so] now [we're] going to approach the fifth [and last] boss of this level, the Guardian. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've got two Ninjas [in] the party, and you know [what that] means - time to flip out [and] kill people. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This dude will give [you] Ragnarok, [the most] powerful sword [in] the game, and which, in most [later] 'Final [Fantasy]' games, is -- is [typically] one [of] the very [best] swords. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [at] this [point, you] need [to] march back through all seven levels of Eureka, in order [to get back] to the Sylx Tower. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yeah, one thing: [Your] Warp spell does [not] work here, [so] you'll [hafta] travel by foot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sylx Tower [provides] you [with] lots of handy Phoenix Downs [and] Elixirs, as well [as] a [set] of Crystal Armor for your second Ninja. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, these guys are called what? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's three times -- three times, [this] episode, where I've had [to] make references to the male discharge. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yes, one other thing I forgot [to] mention... (get this!). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no place [to] save [your] game in this entire mega-dungeon complex. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to [literally] walk all the way back to the beginning of the dungeon [and exit into] the [overworld], and then save. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then retrace all [your] steps [back to] where ya left off. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The sheer sadism of this makes me strongly [recommend] using save states on an emulator. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so we're [finally getting] closer [to] the end of this multi-dungeon dungeon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [are] trapped by these Dragons, but thanks [to] the power of [friendship], we [can] escape. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The ghost of Unei [and Doga will] reach [out] to the various [friends] you've made [throughout] the game and call [them to your] aid, such as Cid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And Desch? {It} turns out he [survived] jumping [into] the furnace. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yeah, like this [little] geek is gonna be {of} much use [at] all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yeah! [And] even one of *these* idiots joins in. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now you [can] escape, [and] you finally run into Xande. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Haste is almost always a really good idea in boss fights since [it] allows you [to hit] the enemy more times while [attacking]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy is gonna cast [Meteor at] you, but hopefully you [can] take [him] down before [he] overwhelms [your] defenses. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Finally, the real boss, the Cloud of Darkness, which was Summoned by Xande and [apparently] is going [to destroy] the universe [or] something. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [it's impossible to] win this [battle]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And [it appears that] all is lost. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] Doga [and] Unei transfer their souls(?) [to] you [and] then vanish [for] good. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, on [to] the final, final, final dungeon, the Dark World. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And be aware [that], by this point, [I] mean, you [can't] leave the final dungeon or save [your] game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [if] you die, [you're gonna] resurrect outside the tower, [and will need to] go back up through the Sylx Tower again and re-[fight] any previous boss [battles]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, when I say this dungeon is sadistic, I'm [not] kidding. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Alright], a mere five boss [battles] left, not counting the [sort] of minibosses [that] appear when ya open [chests] containing the Ribbons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These guys [are just] weaker versions of Xande. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Dark World has a hub-style layout, [so] you [can] take on the bosses [in] any [order ya] want. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's Echidna, a [pretty] ugly boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Real-life echidnas are [just] anteater-[like] creatures. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You are [probably] familiar [with] a [certain] video game echidna. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And one thing [about] echidnas is they have very [weird] penises. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, this Echidna is half-woman/half-snake - a creature from Greek [mythology]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Scylla, who you killed earlier, is her [daughter] and her son, Cerberus, is another boss [in] this dungeon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, [and] by the way, 'Final [Fantasy]' fans [might] be [familiar with] her other son, [Orthros]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Echidna [got] in a good one here, petrifying one of my Sages. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [every] time you [defeat] one [of] these four bosses, a [little] Dark Warrior [appears]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These are, like, your evil [equivalents] from the Dark Side. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even the Dark Warriors [are kind] of sick of Dark Cloud's shit [and] agree [to] help you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey! Here's Cerberus. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Meteor doesn't] seem to have much effect on him, but physical attacks boosted by Haste [do] work wonders on him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And he [just] blasts you nonstop [with lightning] attacks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next up, Ahriman, making his debut [performance] in the series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He would go on to appear in [just 'bout] every single 'Final [Fantasy]' game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He [alternates between different] types of [magic] attacks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sometimes he'll s... -- [hit] you [with an] Elemental Attack (which is [good], since you have resistance [to] those). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or he [might] use [Meteor] (which is bad, [because it hits] much harder). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The -- The [battle] for this guy is [kinda] similar [to] the final boss, in [that] you [will just] have [your] Ninjas pound him [constantly while] using the Sages to [constantly] heal the whole [party]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And finally, the 2-Headed Dragon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess they ran [out] of clever names, [at] this point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] wow! [28] hits? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy will try [to] -- This guy will try [to] stomp [your party] members, 'n' -- one [at] a time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, I'm leveled up enough so [that his attacks don't actually] kill me. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Ya don't actually hafta fight] these guys [to beat] the game, [but] you'll want to because if you free the four Dark [Knights], they will shave off [around 20,000 Hit Points from] Dark Cloud. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [For] the [most part], dungeons in "Final [Fantasy] III" [are pretty straightforward], compared [to] those [in] 'Dragon Quest', with their [confusing] maze-like layouts [and kinda] weird gimmicks (like the conveyor belts). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [only] dungeon [that] gets a [little] annoying [in this] game is the Dark World, which uses invisible passageways and dead [ends and] such. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you reach the final boss, you must assemble the most powerful [party possible to fight] Dark Cloud, and [your] two Ninjas [and] Sages [just won't cut it]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here [we create] the [ultimate fighting] force: three Bards [for] attacking [and] a Scholar [for magic] support. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, well, no. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You -- You are clearly [supposed to] use Ninjas [and] Sages because they are simply the [most] powerful [and] flexible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's really no benefit in using anything else. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, in the recent "Final [Fantasy] III" "...Pixel..." remake, they [actually] nerfed these guys [considerably]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, for [that] version, they're not necessarily the best [party]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, Dark [Cloud will just hit] you over [and] over again [with an] attack [called Particle] Beam, slowly wearing down [your] health. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [right] away, you should [equip] the shurikens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have [to sort] of manually [equip] them each time, because [when] you throw them [that] one is used up [and] you [can't] use [it] a second time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] hold one [in] each hand. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] they are the [most powerful] weapon in the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I had nine shurikens, so two turns using those, plus one extra. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] then I [switched back to] my [most powerful] swords, the Katanas. Mitch. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [But, ya] know, [it] is [kind] of a shame [that] for a game that emphasizes [flexibility and] choice, [it] virtually forces you [to] use this specific [party] for this [battle]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But, ya] know, what if there was another choice? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What if there was [an] even more powerful [party available, hiding] right under our noses the whole time? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hmm! Onion Knights are [utterly] useless. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They [can only] equip the [most] basic weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [strongest] sword they [can] use is the [Mythril] sword with a puny 15 [Attack Points, and] they can't use magic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, when they have low health, they fall down [and] cry like [little] babies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But there is a very well-hidden [secret in this] game [that will] allow the Onion Knights [to] reach their full potential. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In Sylx Tower, on [certain] floors, there're these very rare Dragon enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Apparently], the chance [of] encountering one is around 1 [out] of [128]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Should you encounter one [of] these Dragons (and I never have) [it will] most likely drop an Elixir, [but] there is a chance [that it will] drop a piece [of] special equipment [that can only] be [used] by Onion Knights. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Onion [Equipment consists] of the Onion Sword, Shield, Helmet, armor, [and] Glove. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] would require an *enormous* amount [of] time [to get] one full Onion Set, and [getting] four is [probably out of the] question. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, there is a game bug [that] can be [exploited]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though some people [believe this was put] in [deliberately for] testing purposes, under the impression [that] no one [would] ever [actually] discover it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I'll] now show ya [how to] do this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [at] any point in the game where ya have an airship [and enough] money, you [can] go in [and] buy a bunch [of] Potions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll need [to] have 99 Potions in [your] inventory; that's the max number [that] you [can] carry. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll then fly [to] the [Floating] Continent [and] go all [the] way [back to] the Altar Cave ([that very first] cave [that] you [started the] game in). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] you need to arrange [your items in] a very specific way. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Bottom left] slot must be empty. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Three] spaces above [that] is where you must [put] the [99] Potions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] there [must] be [an item in] all the surrounding slots [as] well, except for [that bottom left] slot. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the [bottom] right slot, i... -- is where [you put] the [item that ya wanna] turn [into] the Onion Equipment (Leather Armor, [in this] case). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Now], you [can] have other [items], like, up above these spaces, [but just to] make [it] look less [complicated], I [removed] all the extraneous stuff [just for] this [demonstration]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as [ya might recall], enemies [in] the Altar Cave sometimes drop Potions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The odds [are about] 1 [in] 4. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If [you're] using save states, you [just rearrange your] inve... -- inventory like I said, [fight an] enemy, and reload if [it doesn't] drop a Potion. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] also do this without save states, [but] this means you have [to] rearrange the [inventory] after each [battle]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If an enemy *does* drop a Potion, the [fact that] you now have [100] Potions in your [inventory] causes some [sort] of overflow issue, which causes [the item that you] placed in the lower [right] corner to [sort] of 'upgrade' [itself] to a different [item]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And this] works [for] any [item, but it just] happens [that] the Leather Helmet, Glove, [and] Shield, [and] Armor [get] upgraded [to] the Onion [equivalent] of those pieces. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, my four Leather Armors [are] now four Onion Armors. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It -- So, when this happens, you [basically just] do another save state, rearrange [your] inventory, [put] another Leather [item into] the [correct] slot, [and repeat]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [getting] all the Onion Armor is [pretty] simple [and can be] done maybe [in about (I don't know) 15] minutes [or] so. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Unfortunately], swords are a [bit] more [complicated] since Ragnarok gets updated [to] the Onion Sword, [and] you [probably don't] have Ragnarok [yet] because [that's the very] final [sword that] you find [in the] game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I did, however, have four Katanas, so I [upgraded] those through various levels, like, to Break Blade, [then] Excalibur, then Ragnarok, [and] then Onion Sword. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [This] is still a [certain amount] of work, but [it's approximately 1,000] times quicker [than] trying [to get] them from the Dragons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [So] now, [basically ya just] change jobs [to] Onion Knight, [put] on [your] new equipment, and... Holy moly! 204 Attack and [185] defense!? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Back [when this] guy was a Magic Knight [with] Genji armor, his [defense] was 56. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [at] this point, you [have] now unlocked the fully-equipped Onion Knight, the [most powerful Fighter in the] game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] these guys are [virtually] unstoppable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {I} mean, [just] look [at] these stats! Evasion: 99%? [Magic Defense: 176]? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [like] nothing [can hurt] you! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the Onion [Helmet acts] as a Ribbon, so [you're immune] to [status ailments]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But there's [actually] more. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you keep Leveling them up, once [ya get] to [about 85 or 86] their baseline stats ([for] Strength, Agility, [and] so on) increases by seven points every time you gain a Level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, once this starts happening, boss fights become [utterly] trivial. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {I} mean, [there's technically] a small chance [that] an attack [will] evade [your defense], so you should have a few Phoenix Downs [and] Potions, [just] in case. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or you [can] temporarily switch to Mage [and] drink [an] Elixir and then Revive [or] Heal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, for the [most part], you [can just sort] of stomp any enemy [without] any [problems whatsoever]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And [as fascinating] as the existence of the Onion Knight is, [it's probably not gonna] be the way [that most] people [actually wanna] play the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Alright, so goin' back] to our normal [party], here, [we're just gonna] keep whittling down Dark Cloud's health. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] there's really no reason [to] be a miser [when it] comes to X.P.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I [had] stockpiled [enough Elixirs that] I [didn't hafta] worry [about] running [out] of magic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Eventually, Dark Cloud] will fall and, [with that], you've finally [beaten] the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A [relatively] long epilogue follows. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You play taxi driver [and] drop off all [your little] buddies back [at] their homes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Final [Fantasy] III" was a substantial commercial [and critical] success for Square, [eventually] selling a... -- around a million [and] a half copies [in] Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By comparison, "[Dragon] Quest IV" sold a [little bit] over twice that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [So], the game was a big [financial] success, though [not quite at 'Dragon] Quest' levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Famitsu gave [it] a [36 out] of 40, making [it] the sixth-[best] score from Famitsu [at that] time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Years [later], Famitsu readers [voted it] #8 in Famitsu's 'best video game of all time' poll, behind "Final [Fantasy] X", "...VII", [and] "...IV", [and also behind "Dragon Quest] III" [and] "...VIII", making [it and "Dragon] Quest III" the [only] FamiCom games [in] the Top 10. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As [for] me, I'd say it's clearly the best [8]-Bit 'Final [Fantasy]' game, [and definitely] the most interesting R.P.G. [for] the system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Its job system, [while somewhat] unusual, would be used again [in] future games, such as "Final [Fantasy] V" [and] "...XII". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But [to] me, this feels [almost kind] of like a turning point in the history [of] the FamiCom - like the end of an era. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Square made this huge sprawling game [and] then [basically] moved on [to] the Super FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And honestly], I [can't] think of a... -- any other ...s... -- especially [notable] FamiCom J.R.P.G. released after this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Japanese [developers] would [continue to produce] FamiCom games, of course, [but] all the big players were transitioning {to} 16-Bits. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [1991 will] be the first year [that produced] fewer FamiCom games [than] the year prior. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We are now [at exactly] 60 episodes, [so I'm] going to officially [divide] the series, [right] here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first 60 episodes chronicled [the] rise [of the] FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The remaining [70 or] so [will] chronicle the system's decline [and] fall. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [We'll] encounter lots of weird [fascinating] games, and a [decent] number of [great] games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But we're basically entering the Byzantine Empire period of the FamiCom, the system's long slow sunset. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For the [moment], though, we will bid April 1990 'Adieu!' and begin May [of] 1990. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kagerou Densetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 May 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by I.T.L. 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pixel Multimedia 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Alright], here's [an] oddity, "Kagerou Densetsu", [published] by Pixel. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is [sort] of mysterious, as we'll discuss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] was developed by I.T.L., a company [that] we've [encountered before]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Kagerou Densetsu" means "Shadow Wolf Legend". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is [sort] of an Action R.P.G. thing, but a very, very basic one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [First of] all, [you'll] need [to] name the three characters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The story is something [about] a demon who has brainwashed Ninjas and killed the [protagonist's] father, [and] now you [and your] buddies need [to] go [out and defeat] the bad guys [or] something. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] tell [this] game [was pretty] low [budget], as there's no [sort] of, like, opening cutscenes [or] anything. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Ya just] wander out into the *hideously* ugly world, whose *terrain* is made up of [flat] ground, hills, trees, [and mountains]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [cannot] walk over the mountains, [and] the road [that ya] see here is [just {to} sorta] give [ya some] general guidance [as to] where [to] go. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You [will constantly] be [forced] into random [battles], where these incredibly fast dudes run back [and] forth [and] attack you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They're -- They're [actually] very annoying. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Every so [often, ya get] to encounter a building like this one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Entering [it will refill your] magic, I [believe, and] sometimes give you a new magic spell. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, a couple {of} things [about] this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As [mentioned], the publisher on this [is] a company [called] Pixel (or Pixel Corporation, as the title screen says). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, we are familiar [with] a company called Pixel [that did] a [lot] of [development work for] other companies, including L.J.N.'s "...X-Men" game [for] the N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [odd] thing is [that the] Pixel we are familiar with did a [lot] of [uncredited] work on N.E.S. games, [but] didn't publish any N.E.S. games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] y... -- yet, here we have a game [published] by Pixel, [but] developed by [an outside] company, which seems a [little] weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] this [is] the [only] console game published by this Pixel. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it does turn [out that in] the mid-'80s, Pixel did publish some M.S.X. games, [right around] the same time they were doing work on various N.E.S. games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] the logo [that] we see on these Pixel M.S.X. games is very different [from] that found on "Kagerou Densetsu"'s [title] screen or the back of the box art. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [So, I] was thinking, "Are these [actually] the same company?". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, 'Pixel' isn't [exactly] a super [creative] name [for] a video game company. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Eventually], though, I did [find some] good [quality] photos of [the] back of the M.S.X. game, ["Thunderbolt", and] I was able to read the address. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And it] is, [in fact], the same address on the back of "Kagerou Densetsu", so I guess [it] actually is the same company. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] this [just] leads to the question, "Why?". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why did Pixel [get] back [into] publishing [for only] one single game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And], of all things, why was [it] this game? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And to] make [matters] more weird, this may have [originally been] planned [to] be [published] by [Taito]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Graphics showing [Taito's] name have [been] found [in] the ROM, [which] makes one wonder if this was originally planned as a sequel [to Taito's 1985] game, "Legend of Kage". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The combat in these two games feels very similar, in [that] Ninjas [just] come running [at] you very fast, nonstop, [and that -- that] you [are] armed with a sword [and some] throwing stars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The lack of jumping all [the] way [up through the] trees is a major thing missing from "Kagerou Densetsu". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 An official sequel to "Legend of Kage" was [released] for the D.S. by [Taito in] 2008. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh! [And] one other fun fact [about this] game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This ad for the game was published [in] Japanese gaming magazines, [and] the art was lifted [directly from] 'Dragon Ball'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Now], there's magic [in this] game, [but it] sucks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In [order to] use [it, you] need [to] press A [and] B [together, and] then use the D-Pad to select what spell [ya wanna] use. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] you [actually sit] down on the ground [while] doing this, making you [completely vulnerable] to enemy attacks, [while you're] casting magic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Everything [about] the presentation in this game makes me wonder [if] this was [developed in] the ['80s and] then [sat] around [for] a few years [and] somehow ended up in Pixel's [possession]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It doesn't] really feel like a [1990] FamiCom game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [I'll just] run down a few other odd things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Connecting the second controller seems to [unlock] cheats (presumably [for] testing purposes?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Holding down B on the [second] controller [will] disable all enemy [encounters] on the overworld. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And using these cheats, [you can also revive yourself] after dying or {allow} [your character to] walk over water [and] mountains. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And [in] terms [of actually beating] the game, you [can] reach [the] final boss [pretty] quickly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A Tool-Assisted Speedrun [beat] it in four [and] a half minutes - [possibly] by using R.N.G. [manipulation in] order to avoid m... -- random [encounters] and essentially also [just] walking the [shortest] path to the final boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In comparison, a T.A.S. speedrun of "Zelda II" takes [around 40] minutes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Same with T.A.S. speedruns of "[Crystalis]". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, there's really [not] much game here, compared [to] other Action R.P.G.s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no N.P.C.s, shops, towns, {or} dungeons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [just] walking through this maze-like overworld, [fighting] random [battles] for experience, and killing a [grand total] of four bosses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Not that] you [will] care, because there's [absolutely] no reason [whatsoever for] you [to] play this game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nekketsu Koukou Dodgeball-bu Soccer-hen 🇯🇵 // Nintendo World Cup 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 May 18 🇯🇵 // 1990 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Technos 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Technos 🇯🇵 // Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One [last] game here - "Nekketsu Koukou Dodgeball-bu Soccer-hen" from [Technos]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And ya might] be wondering, 'Is [this] a Soccer Game or a Dodgeball Game?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe [it's] both! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, actually no; [it's just] soccer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] boys [have] decided [to] take a break from dodgeball. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there [is actually] a story, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a big soccer game coming up, [but unfortunately] the soccer team [ate some] sushi [and] came down [with] a bad case of salmonella, so the dodgeball team [decided to] fill in [for] them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Can the gang of lovable [misfits defeat] the other school's soccer team? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, yes... using [the] power of physical violence. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, [and] by the way, here's a [little tidbit that] I picked up [from] Japanese Wikipedia's summary of [the] game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "His special move is nut shooting." 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "NUT SHOOTING". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And, of] course, this thing [got] released in the U.S. [and] Europe as "Nintendo World Cup", [with] a slammin' new [musical] intro. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [instead of] having high school kids [playing] soccer, we [now] have 12 [international] teams. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And the] teams [are actually] different, in a way [which] I [will] discuss a [bit later]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as far [as] Soccer Games go, [this is pretty] decent. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have [some] control over the A.I., here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [I'm] changing how [often] my team shoots [and] a couple [other] things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It's probably] best [to not] have the goalkeeper join in. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Since [this is] a 'Kunio-kun' game, you [can get] rough on [the field]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Just] go ahead [and] knock the crap [out of] the opposing team. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There [will just] be bodies lying out [on] the field [in this] game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [I'll admit], I've never [been] a big fan of Soccer Games [for] the N.E.S., [but] "Nintendo World Cup" is [pretty] playable! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [fast]-paced, [it's not] too complicated; it's [kinda] like "Super Dodgeball". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there is one other interesting thing here; you have special [moves that] you [can] pull off by [hitting] the A [and] B [buttons together]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But apparently] this special move [will only] be [performed] if you've actually traveled a [certain] number of steps since [the] last time you [stopped]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, when you [get] the ball, you [hafta] move, say, 12 steps, then [hit] A [and] B on the 12th step... I think. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I had a hard time pulling these things off, [but] if you do so successfully, you [will] use a special powerful kick [or] something. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each team has [its] own special. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game was [pretty] successful [and got ported to] the Genesis, the Game Boy, [and the] P.C. Engine. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is probably not [most] people's favorite 'Kunio...' game, [but] you [could absolutely] do worse when [it] comes [to] Soccer Games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 60 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I [was] originally planning [to] do a 'Chronturbo' episode next, [but] have decided [to postpone] it, since (after "Final [Fantasy] III") I [just cannot] handle tackling "Ys: Books I [&] II" [right] now. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But [it will] be happening soon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Best] Game this episode? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, it's "Final [Fantasy] III" - perhaps the best J.R.P.G. on the system. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Worst] Game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'll say "DynoWarz...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I hate [to] use terms like 'lazy [developers]'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I [don't] know why [the] game turned [out the] way [it] did, [but] upon [release] this thing [probably] cost around $[70] in [today's] money. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Considering the game just [repeats] the same level over [and] over again, it's [kinda] hard [to not consider this to] be a [bit] of a rip-off. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next [episode will] be a [little] more chill with another Disney Capcom game and a nice [little Shooter] with a rather [unfortunate] name [in the] Japanese version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And also... ah, damn it! 🍇

👓🏮🍊🥝 "953| Castle Quest
👓🏮🍋🥝 954| Snake's Revenge
👓🏮🍋🥝 955| Ys II
👓🏮🍋🥝 956| Baken Hisshou Gaku: Gate In
👓🏮🍋🥝 957| Jajamaru Gekimaden" 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In addition [to] this, the long-overdue Herschel [Gordon] Lewis video [will finally] be [released]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, see you all soon. 🍇🍌
