👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 26 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So finally we have the long long overdue "Chrontendo Episode 26", featuring part two of the great 1980's an R.P.G. showdown. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In "Chronsega ... 4" we saw "Phantasy Star". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We now take a look at "Final Fantasy" almost certainly the best remembered N.E.S. R.P.G. (at least outside of Japan). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there's more! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Capcom steps into the console arena with "Mega Man" and Data East finally makes a good game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we have an oddball R.P.G. from Nintendo and a port of an old American R.P.G.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This episode probably doesn't really need any bonus content, but here it is - a look at the Top 100 games of all time, as voted by the readers of that mizzu. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Yamamura Misa Suspense: Kyouto Ryuu No Tera Satsujin Jiken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's begin with an Adventure Title, "Yamamura Misa Suspense: Kyouto Ryuu No Tera Satsujin Jiken" from Taito. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Title recently put out their first R.P.G. and now they try their hand at the Adventure Game genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this stage, Taito is to outsourcing all his original FamiCom games, So this one is developed by Tose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, this is actually a [pretty] quality intro, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's unusually cinematic, almost "Ninja Gaiden". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tose has been steadily improving the quality of their output. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The character portraits in this game are quite nice and a hell of a lot better looking than their earlier games (like kinnikuman, for example). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so we're in Kyoto, checking out the cherry blossoms or whatever and then a body! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Will you be able to find the killer? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sure, by using all the little options in your toolbar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can Walk, Listen, Look, Pick Up - all the skills that detective needs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Younger misspent" uses a rather unique looking series of icons on the action bar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The ear is actually talk not listen, by the way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wonder why they didn't use a mouth? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess the other people actually do all the talking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So is usually a talk to the people involved and look for clues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Doesn't really seem too far out of the ordinary. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what's with the title? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yamamura Misa is a popular Japanese mystery writer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe he was involved in Japanese television series as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There were a few other yamamura Misa suspense games, but the series quickly jumped from Taito to other labels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the last one was a 3D Oh game, oddly enough. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, this is all very interesting, but I guess not too terribly spectacular. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's nice That title is, sort of, stretching out a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it's a bit of a slow start this episode and we've got some other weird titles coming up as well. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Tennis 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, it's another game and Namco 'Family Sports' series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last time we saw one of these was way back in August ("Family Mahjong", I believe). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There were two 'Family Sports' Games in December. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First up is "Family Tennis". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll see another one next time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the Tennis Game that much is clear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 My pajFamiCom and Golf Games we've been seeing there are multiple play options. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Exhibition is like a one-off game, whereas tournament and World Tour are well, tournament games ready to face off against a whole series of players. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's funny, all these new based on real tennis players. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All take macaroni, I guess, (tennis racket playing not included). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is there any difference between the players? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also get to choose the tournament that you want to play. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great rendition of God Save the Queen, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If nothing else, this game has decent production values. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is the second FamiCom Tennis Game and In gameplay terms, not much has really changed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I mean, how could it really? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tennis is the simplest video game possible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Move your player, hit a button, swing the racket. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, in this case, the D-Pad controls the direction of the shot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The camera does move around [pretty] poorly depending on where your balls headed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I know I'm terrible at this game, but is playing against the computer really this hard? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems impossible to read to serve each time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's quite easy to get a fault while serving; I've actually lost a few points strictly from faults. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, when playing the exhibition mode, you have a few different options (like what kind of court you're playing on). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here, of course, is the ridiculously silly Cosmo mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're actually playing tennis in space. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I was saying, Tennis Games are [pretty] basic, gameplay-wise. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's really not that much Namco can do with the idea of hitting a ball back and forth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not really much to run that old Atari 2600 Tennis Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As for how it handles well, it's kind of hard to say. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really good enough to judge but the C.P.U. opponents completely whip me every time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 2-Player modes, this is not going to be a problem. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, modern day Tennis Games have all kinds of crazy control options, but none of that's on display, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if you're looking for just a basic get the ball back and forth in this game, go ahead and give this one a shot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ooh! I made a funny. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gokuraku Yuugi: Game Tengoku 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 12 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SOFEL 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by SOFEL 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the weirder games we've seen was the "Santa Claus note to Carl Bako" for the F.D.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Part of the game was simply these weird gaming result generators. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It produced like random bingo numbers and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, how would you like another one? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 From Sofia we have "Goku Raku uwg game tun Goku" (or 'Game Heaven' - a name that rather oversells the game). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are a number of different options available, some of which are Similar to the Santa Claus game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, once again, there's the bingo number generator. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Cute graphics hover and I like the way you can hit the chicken repeatedly to change the numbers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, we have this weird blackjack style game involving people on a little roller coaster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then there's the old favorite random dice throws. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are some other things some of which actually resemble real games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's like, sort of, like a slot machines thing, Poker (where both hands are visible for some reason), and a memory solitaire game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is just, sort of, another quickie F.D.S. disk. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've stated before that the FamiCom Disk System is quickly becoming a repository for cheapo games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There will still be some decent titles coming out from time to time, but it's worth noting that all the big games of December 1997 were on cartridges. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tetsudou Ou: FamiCom Boardgame 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 12 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by dB-Soft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by dB-Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "game 10 Goku" was a little odd and continuing the similar vein, it's "Tet pseudo-railroad game". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the subtitle of this game is actually 'FamiCom Board Game'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Railroad-based games quite popular Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Recall that Hudson's "Momotarou Densetsu" game, there was a popular spin-off of that it was a railroad-themed game called "momento dentetsu". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sounds bizarre, I know. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, tuxedo is one of those sorts of games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, it's not the first Japanese real game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That honor might go to "a Russia the Ico" (a.k.a. 'take the a train' - a very early railroad Simulation Game from 1986). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The series is quite popular in Japan and still around today. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, Tetsuo also combines that with the game of Life (you know, the Board Game, read, travel around, get a job, make money, et cetera). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Video games based on the game of Life were not uncommon in Japan and we'll undoubtedly see more of them in the future. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So how do you play this game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, as you can see, the layout does resemble a Board Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is a brace work train tracks going everywhere. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the spinner and move around on the board and then various sorts of lucky or unlucky events occur. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, with me like a fire or something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Else burned down. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, you know, there's lucky things that can happen to you as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, for example, sometimes you make money. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One way of making money is by betting on horses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, there is a horse racing minigame in, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the developer of this title is DB soft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've also seen games like "flappy", "Woody Poco", "Galaga", and a few others. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is actually their last FamiCom game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've never really understood video game is based on, sort of, regular games, you can just play with the board or with a deck of cards or something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But they're quite popular in both Japan and the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is I suppose our official welcome to the Japanese Board Game genre. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ginga no Sannin 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Enix 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Holy cow! Nintendo finally goes R.P.G. (sort of, as we'll see). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a "Ginga no setting", which means something like 'galaxy trio'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While Nintendo obviously made its name with Platformer, Action-Adventure, and Sports titles they've been branching out to other genres in the last few months. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've seen them take on Adventure Games and Dating Sims and now we have the first Nintendo-published R.P.G. for the system. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this has, sort of, an odd history. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, there's the typical Sci-Fi plot, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mankind attacked by mysterious alien forces. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the strange thing about "Ginga note Santa" is that it's actually a port of a Computer Game from 1985. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the original title of this was "Chico cinchy raiza" or 'Earth fighter ryza', originally released for the FM-7 computer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This version is for the P.C.-88 and it's [pretty] much identical. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the game was originally from Enix, as you can see the title screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It features turn-based space battles, involving mechs and robots and that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It looks very similar to "cruise chaser blasty", which was Square's first R.P.G., which was also on the P.C.-88. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like that game, actually playing it is, sort of, an arduous process. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's lots of menus and it is kind of slow moving. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure how or why Nintendo decided to acquire the rights for a fan of comm port, or why they decided to completely change the name. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe they didn't want consumers know this was a two year old game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, regardless of the original vintage Inca has been given up post-"Dragon Quest II" makeover (you know with a little boxes and options and menus and whatnot). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now one unusual thing about "Ganga" is that is once again a Japanese game in which was seemingly borrowed from "Star Raiders". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have the typical galaxy map with enemies, bases, and planets. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You travel around the galaxy and you progress bit by bit (sort of space by space) with a chance of a random battle every stop along the path. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and, of course, the other character (the male character) must be about the most douchebag-y-looking guy ever seen in any video game, so far. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now when you reach a planet you'll find these side-view, sort of, almost like dungeon sections, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's, sort of, cruise along looking for power-ups and helpful items and it will be some some enemies in some of the dungeons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the map screen you'll also find bases and traveling to those will replenish your Hit Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "In good no sending" goes a little bit overboard with the enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can face up to nine enemies at once (though always have the same kind and your attacks will hit all the enemies). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really sure what happens later in the game, but it seems that once you've traveled all over and explore the solar system, you'll find warps to other parts of the galaxies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll even obtain a third-party member - a little girl who naturally has ESP powers (like all little girls and video games seem to do). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Several large bosses are found on each level; I'm coming up to one now. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now aside from your lasers, you have a limited number of missiles, and they're [pretty] powerful and helpful against the bosses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can actually choose how many to fire at once from the menu. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though when you're shooting, it looks more like you're throwing rocks at the boss, rather than firing missiles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah, here we go. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, I hadn't been considering my missiles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose "Binga" would be one of those, sort of, lesser known FamiCom releases from Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting that Nintendo seems to be deliberately developing games in two categories. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those that are have intended international releases and those are there [only] for Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As for this game not being released over here, well, it's probably not a huge loss as "Ginga" seems to be too repetitive even in comparison to other R.P.G. Jeez. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the fact that you have to use a menu command to move is quite irritating. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Interesting-looking title, though Nintendo would later go on to put their names on better R.P.G.s, such as the Mother games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The most notable thing is that the characters were designed by Japanese cartoonist go and the guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the music was actually done by yukihiro Takahashi from Yellow Magic Orchestra. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Too bad that talent wasn't used in a more interesting game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Exciting Boxing 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 16 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami is winding down its 'Exciting Sports' series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Exciting Boxing" is, I believe, the second-to-last game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami has been putting these things out quite quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first one, "Exciting Billiard", came out in June. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Typically the intro has great music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So a Konami Boxing Game sounds like a good idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After all "Exciting Basket" was excellent, but this isn't quite the game you hope it's going to be. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see, rather than using "Punch-Out"-style controls, "Exciting Boxing" actually came with an inflatable punching bag boxer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can see a little bit on the box art and here's an ad gives you an idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sorry, I couldn't come up with a better picture, but I think this, sort of, gives you the general idea of what it actually looks like. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, this thing had sensors in it that picked up where do you hit it! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's, uh, different sorts of punches: high, low, jabs, hooks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The training session will help your boxer build up his strength and speed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the game is a series of fights - seven in total, one for each weight class. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather than working with to the championship in your own weight class as an real boxing, you fight the champion of each different class. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thus, apparently you end up holding with health for every single weight class becoming the all time grand boxing champion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You play simply By hitting the bag. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure how responsive the thing was in real life, uh, but the controls have been emulated, so you can play it here today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You may have to knock down the guy more than once before he stays out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and his mouthpiece always goes flying whenever you knock them out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami seems interested in coming up with weird controllers to their games ("Don't worry Mikko" being another example). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember, of course, these are the guys who later come out with "DDR" and "beat mania". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still as interesting as this is I think I would actually like to see a more traditional Boxing Game from Konami. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Exciting Boxing" certainly sounds a little gimmicky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And who knows how well the bag actually hold up? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can't imagine there are too many of these things floating around in perfect condition. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Rockman 🇯🇵 // Mega Man 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "3030" ♪ by Deltron 3030

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 17 🇯🇵 // 1987 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so forget all that other crap this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 December 17 sees our first great game - Capcom's "RockMan". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The 'RockMan' series eventually became very successful and dozens of games have been released. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The outside of Japan we know this game under the name "Mega Man". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We obviously got the worst title screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mega Man is Action Platformer, but a very unique one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Right from the get-go, we can choose which order we play levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right; the first six levels can be played or replayed in any order. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we'll start with guts man, which is, sort of, now the traditional first level to take. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mega Man's non-linearity is one defining feature of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The other of course, is the other difficulty. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Within 10 seconds of commands level, you encounter some very tricky jumping. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Yes, well timed and controlled jumps are frequently necessary in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows how many kids, accustomed to "Super Mario...", freaked out when they encounter that very first sequence there on the moving platforms. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It might not be cleared all those played "Mega Man" but your margin of error and timing the jumps is often very small. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's quite easy to jump a split second too early or late and plummet fear of death. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Plummeting to your death is what we might call, sort of, a recurring theme in "Mega Man". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So once you reach the end of each level, you're locked in a room and in a battle one of the six Robot Masters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's guts man himself, known for his ability to throw enormous rocks at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One nice touch all the bosses have visible Life Meters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So far, this is not much different than "Castlevania", or most of the other Platformers we've seen so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But here's the catch - After defeating a boss, you'll get his Special Weapon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With guts man For example, He received his arm that allows you to throw moveable blocks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thus, much like "Metroid", they'll gradually increase your arsenal as you play through the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now it should be clear that "Mega Man" was intended to be a [pretty] special game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it was released in Japan and the U.S. almost simultaneous. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. released was somewhat botched, however, as it features some of the worst oxheart in the history through the console. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While the Japanese card got a standard automated style art of Rockman in the U.S., we got this guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I actually wish I knew the story behind the creation of that particular cover art, since it became so notorious for being very ugly and not really looking like anything in the game itself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The terrible cover art is kind of a shame because "Mega Man" is what you would call a labor of love. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was the brainchild of artist kg and funa creator and Game Designer Akira kitamura. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 M Producer tokunbo Fujiwara, might be considered to be, sort of, like the she grew me and load club Capcom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because other credits include "Ghosts 'n' Goblins", "Bionic Commando", original "Commando", "Resident Evil" and many more games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The name "RockMan" refers to rock 'n' roll rocks robot sister is called roll and musical references are found all throughout the series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S. the name was changed perhaps because Capcom U.S.A. sounds weird to American kids - or possibly due to the name already being used by the legendary purple music amplifier designed by Tom Schultz. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Supposedly 'Rainbow Man' was one of the outcomes Before 'Mega Man' was finally settled upon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A man's critters had a bit of a mean streak which, coupled with the game's innovative platforming, made it one of the toughest for the N.E.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, here's the first of several disparate block sequences. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to know exactly when and where the next block will appear since the block you're standing on will usually disappear before the next block appears. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is, you'll already be in mid-jump when the next block appears. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 These ridiculous things (those big eyes) do major damage if they touch you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They either jump higher low randomly, C.D.s were run under the break quickly when the opportunity arises. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eah level has a theme, by the way, based on the boss of that particular level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here's the thing - Each boss is weak to a certain other boss's weapon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Iceman, For example, we saw just a second ago will take big damage from electrical pans Thunder beam, so tackling electric man first will make Iceman a lot easier. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can then use it man's Eye Slash or take on fire man and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the Special Weapons are helpful during the actual levels themselves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As we saw a second ago the jets and planes frozen than jumped on the ice slasher. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the game, sort of, like a "Metroid" feel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now "Mega Man" has a very generous Health Meter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can take quite a few hits, but that won't help you against frequently falling to your death. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from displaying difficult jumps, there's a possibility of getting hit by projectile or enemy while jumping, which will often cause you to lose a life. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, "Mega Man" (like Simon Belmont) does get pushed back a bit when he's hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will cause him to fall off the ledge. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mega Man has no paid game feature passwords into play at all in one sitting which can be a bit much. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot of practices required to complete this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now once you defeated called six robot monsters will be on the final level, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Level of the evil Dr. Wily. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We saw the smug bastard flying the flying saucer just a moment ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first six levels are really just a warm up for the very lengthy and difficult final doctor level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now Capcom really ramped up the platforming elements of this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No other company other than maybe the Japanese to put Mario to required so much careful or lucky jumping. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It should be noted, the controls on this game are very tight and very precise. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now aside from the disprin blocks maybe the most infamous part of Batman is this guy, the Yellow Devil or the rock monster - far and away the toughest boss in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He breaks himself into 19 pieces would come flying across the screen at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You then have time to get exactly one hit in the thunder beam and then he comes again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to memorize the pattern of the pieces and execute asserts perfectly timed jumps to avoid getting hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each block does huge damage so you can't make more likable mistakes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The battle was quite nerve wracking, but there's a cheat that makes things easier. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Pausing and pausing the game at the right time will cause him pick multiple hits as your lightning passes through. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But still the first time you fight this guy he seems literally impossible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It takes a lot of practice to what the blocks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm sure tons of Nintendo controller was thrown out the window, the first time this guy was encountered. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if that weren't bad enough into rebuttal all the robot masters a second time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, have all the weapons which is helpful, but you have to defeat four of them back to back with no health refills, and that can be a bit trying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Mega Man", I guess is a very early example, but we call boss Rush. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, it turns out "Final Fantasy" does the same thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to refight all the bosses in the last level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, on top of all this, there's two other boss fights. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, some flying bubble robots, and the other one against a clone of Mega Man himself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the thing is, whenever you switch to a Special Weapon, so does your clone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this can actually be a tough fight. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to, sort of, use the regular blaster most of the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll get all the way through Dr. Wiley's robot factory and then you're in the homestretch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while the very final areas lacking on health refill fills, at least does give you one last final weapon to refill up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each of the Special Weapons, by the way, has a limited number of shots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And so they must be refilled just like your health. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Turns out Dr. Wiley is Not too difficult himself - not nearly like the rock monster. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the story behind this game is actually quite well-known. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mega Man supposedly didn't sell too well, but maybe this was due to lack of promotion on Capcom's part. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently, Capcom didn't have much interest in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Looking back now, you really, sort of, have to wonder what Capcom was thinking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mega Man was, far and away, the best FamiCom game they produced the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Prior to this, everything they put out for the system was based on an Arcade Game, other than a few marginal titles like that 'Mahjong' game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But Capcom's status as a great publisher of console games really begins right here with "Mega Man". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Looking back now, it's clear that "Mega Man" is a major turning point, both Capcom and for platform games in general. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Having played a lot of these earlier FamiCom, post-"...Mario..." Platformers, a lot of them really are quite dull and repetitive and really not that exciting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, sure you, sort of, jump around and climb ladders and stuff, but it's really not that interesting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With "Mega Man", every level is different and unique and you're always kept on your toes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You really have no idea what's coming up next. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from the stuff like the disappearing blocks at some points, you actually have to use the magnetic beam in order to create your own platforms. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game gives the player some discretion as to how they want to play it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, if you use them the other levels first and get the magnetic beam. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It makes that jumping sequence in the first part of guts man's level much easier. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Mega Man" did completely raise the bar for Platforming Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One's got a [pretty] cool ending sequence, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually "Mega Man" takes off his costume, runs back home against the sunset. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now eventually, of course, the quitters the "Mega Man" were vindicated. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Capcom grudgingly allowed a sequel to be made, which went on to sell over a million copies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And 'Mega Man' eventually, of course, became perhaps Capcom's most prolific franchise. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While the first "Mega Man" game might not be quite as good are well-loved as "Mega Man 2" or "... 3", it is still a darned darned good game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ultraman 2: Shutsugeki Katoku Tai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bandai 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've reached December 18th - a big day with seven games released, including a bunch of crap and "Ultraman 2", which is simply unfathomable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ultraman 2: shoot to Geki Kotaku tie" (or 'Ultraman 2: Special Police Force Sortie'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This F.D.S. game from Bandai is a sequel to the 'Ultraman' game, released in January of 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, that was a simple scrolling Action Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is a bit different. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1987, we've seen games get much more complex. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everything has to have R.P.G. elements or something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I guess that's the rationale on this, sort of, massive genre switch that occurred of this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later games wave and further afield with various ultimate R.P.G. is being released. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you start off selecting some options, choosing your equipment, and then it seems you, uh, need to stop a monster from destroying the city. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmmm. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, there are certainly games that I absolutely fail to get at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 An "Ultraman 2" is one of them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have either a car or a jet you can use to tour around the city in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both seem absolutely worthless when it comes to Monster destroying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also run around on-foot very, very slowly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have laser guns or missiles (or -- or something like that) which you can shoot at the monster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you have limited ammo (about 50 shots). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can put every single shot into the monster, and then... nothing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He just keeps on going. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can even get jets to fly overhead and bomb him, which also doesn't kill him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually he'll march on over to the hospital and level it and then it's Game Over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There must be something I'm missing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Power-ups? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 More ammo? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The ability to turn into Ultraman? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some way of actually killing the monster? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I really couldn't figure it out this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ultraman 2" doesn't certainly look very good and exciting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first game was terrible so I very much doubt we're missing much. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Karnov 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 18 🇯🇵 // 1988 January [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East | Sakata SAS 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // Data East 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's another old-school favorite from Nintendo Entertainment System: "Karnov" from Data East. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While not as popular or successful as "Mega Man" corner is very much a high-quality Action Platformer in the classic 8-bit style. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, Karnov himself has been widely mocked online, mostly because... well, he's a big fat Russian dude with a serious disinclination toward shirts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 According to the manual, he's a circuit strong man off retrieved a treasure of Babylon... which was stolen from his village by a dragon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, I'm going to reveal there's much more to it than that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 See, here's the real story of Karna off from the Japanese version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right; the original Japanese release had an introduction and cutscenes to the story and everything. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might, sort of, think of Karnov as being like a pompous bastard. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But here it turns out he was actually sent to the job by God Himself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right; Karnov is actually a dead guy who gets sent back to Earth as penance for the evil deeds he did while he was alive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now you know why Karnov always beams down on a lightning bolt and how he's able to shoot fireballs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All of these cutscenes were removed when the game was released in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Just the title screen was kept. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But having the backstory on Karnov makes him a much more sympathetic character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I really, sort of, see Karnov in a whole new light now. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now originally, of course, Karnov was an Arcade Game from Data East released in 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the Arcade Round Up, a few episodes ago, I mistakenly said it was by Nichibutsu. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is clearly one of the many "Ghosts 'n Goblins"-inspired Platformers which has an Eastern feel to it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the setting is one of the southern Soviet states, like Kurdistan or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Numerous changes were made for the home port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the basic concept is the same. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You travel through several sides when levels and beat a boss, then move on to the next level (nine in total). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Along the way, there's plenty of helpful items to collect: bombs, a shield, boots (that jump higher), wings (that will enable you to fly), and a ladder (to help you retire areas). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah. In the cutscenes in between levels, God will actually give you tips. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was never quite sure what to make of this boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess he's supposed to be a guy holding a lion on a leash? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now Karnov is quite adept at jumping and climbing and pass it through quite a few different types of terrain. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's actually a lot of variety in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while each level is [pretty] linear, there are often different paths you can take, especially in the later levels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, jumping down a shaft will reveal an underground passage, full of the K icons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those icons are, sort of, like Mario's coins; if you collect enough you'll get an extra life. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You Start off with a measly single shot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But clip a couple of power-ups you know have three screams rapid fire shots take down most enemies with a quick volley of fireballs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bosses are much tougher, but the triple shot is still reasonably effective. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike in the Arcade Game, here Karnov can actually take two hits before dying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He'll turn a rather distressing shade of green after the first hit, but luckily, health refills are [pretty] common. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the graphics in "Karnov" are really nice and the details and the environments hold a lot of variation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the ice level, for example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It really does give you the feeling of, sort of, crossing an icy mountain pass. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 God asked Karnov if he's able to handle swimming the Black Sea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course! This is Karnov! He can handle anything! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He even brings little flippers with him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...Mario..." and "Alex Kidd" made the underwater levels a little tough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mario had to constantly paddle to keep from sinking and Alex tended to float. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But Karnov can swim underwater, just as easily as if he were walking on dry ground. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's lots of caves to explore for power-ups and that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While "Karnov" isn't exactly "Metroid", it does make full use both of horizontal and vertical scrolling (more so than most platforms at the time). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here Karnov has to climb over an extremely tall building. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At other points he plants the pyramids, down through underground caverns... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Reminds me a bit of "Rygar" with all the heavy vertical movement. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this particular level, it looks like Karnov's in Greece. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, most of the items aren't strictly necessary, some are very helpful. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The shield will make certain bosses a lot easier, as it absorb a few hits. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the weirdest, most anachronistic enemy - these are bodybuilder guys! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Something you do see from time to time in Japanese video games (Cho Aniki, for example). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's funny; "Karnov" has a bad reputation among some folks on the internet today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, at the time, this was definitely one of the better Action Games for the system. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are some frustrations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Karnov is easier to probe and say Simon Belmont, but he still moves a bit sluggishly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And at time the death's door unfair since the hit tection borders on absurd at times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Check out this example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jumping over from fireballs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoa! Let's take a closer look at that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jumping and... Hmm! There you go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, "Karnov" up has enough great moments to make overlook things like that, like an entire level but you have to fly through. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The flight power has a time limit, so you need to keep finding more of those power-ups, which really, sort of, ratchets up the tension and a level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the most part, though, "Karnov" is really not that difficult to game, especially if you've got the triple shot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The controls are tight enough where you won't find yourself constantly missing jumps all the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, one thing is conaf is not really a very long game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's much shorter than "Rygar", for example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the fact that many levels contain multiple paths gives you a bit more replay value than your typical Platformer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually you will reach the ninth level and come to the Final boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is actually a three headed dragon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's the fair boss; you just need to get out of the way of his attacks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He isn't one of those, uh, monsters that kills me all these random unpredictable attacks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After defeating him in the U.S. version, you get, sort of, a typical 'Congratulations' message. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, there's actually a bona fide ending with Karnov getting a promotion and the world ended up being safe from demons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, by the way, this great English patch is courtesy of Vice Productions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Data East, Congratulations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You've certainly had a spotty track record of games with FamiCom, but you really pull this one-off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a huge improvement over such stuff as "Kid Nicky", and definitely the best game that ease has released in the U.S. so far. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is yet another solid game, this episode! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Stick Hunter 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Micronics 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by KAC 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This week's winner in the ridiculous name sweepstakes: "Stick Hunter". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure what, sort of, image that name is supposed to conjure up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is an Ice Hockey Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Exciting Ice Hockey', as it says, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You would think Konami would have already had that name taken. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game is from K. Amusement, the same guys who've released FamiCom versions of a few SNK games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, just like the FamiCom "Ikari" and "Athena", our good buddies at Micronics are responsible for this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are some Hockey Games which have a good reputation (Nintendo's "Ice Hockey" and Konami's "Blades of Steel"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Stick Hunter" is on a completely different level than those games - a much much lower level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, skaters are heavy and hard to control. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Penalties are quite easy to get and it's very simple a beat the computer to face off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you have the puck it's best to hang on to it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Passing as a joke in "Stick Hunter". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Control of your player is handled automatically. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there doesn't need to be any way to manually switch from one player to the other. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And often you'll find yourself wanting to control the player that's actually closer to the puck. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes the player under control is completely off the screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, as is now custom, there's a little halftime show. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is reasonably cute. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, aside from all this, the one thing that really drives me crazy about "Stick Hunter" is that it's [pretty] much impossible to score a goal. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your shots traveled very slowly and the computers goalie will always block it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I couldn't really find any way of getting a more powerful shot out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And why is the yellow team not wearing pants? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All in all "Stick Hunter" is a huge mess. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is exactly what I've come to expect from Micronics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, they're not going to be going anywhere anytime soon. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Taito Grand Prix 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Now Production 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh man! That's some frenetic opening music! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Taito Grand Prix: Eikō Heno Licence" a Racing Game from -- (well, it's from) Taito, as a matter of fact. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm going to guess the subtitle means 'license to glory'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot of options on the menu screen lead us to believe this will not be your usual Racing Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to enter your name and all that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then... well, it's "Dragon Quest" on wheels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, maybe not exactly, but not too far off either. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess Taito Grand Prix is the closest to a driving R.P.G. we've seen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose, is where the first console game with a Career Mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You drive around from city to city, each city having a series of races you need to win. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from entering races, there's a shop in a city where you can buy upgrades to your vehicle, and a, sort of, status screen where you can customize your car. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What's this? Customize your car in 1987? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, "Taito Grand Prix" has a lot of features that are now standard in modern Racing Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Switching out parts is one of them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you start off at the bottom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can [only] enter the Class D races. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Select a race and then Off you go! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The races are time trials, not real races against other drivers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Clearly "OutRun" is the major influence here, right down to the banner that stretches across the starting line. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess attendance at the "Taito Grand Prix" is, sort of, down. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Only] four people showed up for the start of the race. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This handles a lot like any other "OutRun"-style game ("Rad Racer", for example). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's three gears; you'll need to usually manually up shift using the D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's one checkpoint in the middle of the track. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you managed to beat the timer, you'll be awarded some money. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the things you can do the money is enforced by new parts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to drive from city to city to compete more races. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each city also has different shops. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a little variety in the tracks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the obligatory nighttime course, for example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, try doing that stunt in "Forza Motorsports". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your vehicle instantly seems to be a Mini Cooper. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a lot of stuff you can buy: brakes, tire suspensions, nytro, spoilers - much like a modern Racing Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose the appeal of Taito Grand Prix is, sort of, similar to that of R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your car starts off lame, slow, handles bad - but through persistence and hard work, you can eventually get improvements to your car's stats. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of the other Racing Games we use have toyed with this idea, but this is the first really go all the way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taito simply said, 'Screw it! We'll give you a crappy car win races and you can Level Up then you'll have your dream machine.'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's another, sort of, very "OutRun" themed level, going by the ocean with little boats in the background. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, eventually acquire enough points and you'll make it to Level C. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can now compete in the C-ranked races, which are a little tougher. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the "Taito Grand Prix" car customization system was a little bit ahead of its time, but this makes perfect sense considering how R.P.G.s are influencing so many genres in 1987. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game does have some aesthetic issues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A little ugly, the tracks are, sort of, repetitive, but what do you expect? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a lot more races than your typical Driving Game at the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there is a non-Career Mode on this, as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can select from the Start menu (just like a standard Driving Mode) and this is done either with a Ferrari or a Formula One. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the Mini Cooper, these are high performance cars and handle very well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So overall, this game is generally [pretty] cool. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's funny. Why new FamiCom Racing Games never seem to come out in the U.S.? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than "Rad Racer", most of the Racers we've seen have had, sort of, Japan-[only] releases. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's very strange. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you know, we've actually got a couple more next episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nazoler Land Special!! Quiz Ou Wo Ikuse 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sunsoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a little look at another quickie F.D.S. game from Sunsoft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This time we have "Nazoler Land Special!! Quiz Ou Wo Ikuse" or "...Quiz Ou Wo Ikuse". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There seems to be some disagreement as to how to transliterate the title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently that means Find Out Quiz Masters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, this is the third 'Nazoler Land' disk from Sunsoft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For those of you with good memories, the first two were a little compilation disks with various simple games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This special disk is simply a Quiz Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A Quiz Game is something we'll encounter a lot of Japanese gaming. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We also have Quiz Games here in the U.S., but it seems like they're things you more find at bars, rather than on home consoles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game is [pretty] bare bones - just questions and answers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing's been done to dress it up at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think Sunsoft will go down in history as perhaps the inventor of shovelware on the consoles. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Final Fantasy 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 18 🇯🇵 // 1990 May [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Square 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Square 🇯🇵 // Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As we hear the first notes of Uematsu's famous score, we have at last reached the big, big game this episode, "Final Fantasy" - the first game in Square's R.P.G. franchise that transformed the company from a small producer of Computer and F.D.S. games, to one of the biggest video game companies in the world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There were tons of 8-bit R.P.G.s but "Final Fantasy" along with "Phantasy Star" are the ones that are most well-loved during the West. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The basic plot setup is given an introductory text but titles doesn't appear quite yet. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Final Fantasy will fall into the category of the "Dragon Quest" clone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It also borrows a lot from Western R.P.G.s, such as "Ultima III". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is [pretty] obvious, right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You begin by choosing your party from six different character classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, Red Mage, White Mage, and Black Mage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Dragon Quest II" or "Phantasy Star" your characters are complete ciphers with no dialogue or characterization. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, I've gone with a Fighter, Thief for physical attacks, White Mage for healing, and Black Mage for magical attacks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you start off on the overworld in front of the castle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here in the castle, you can talk to the various castle folk who wonder if you're disabled light warriors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll also find a King who asked you to rescue his daughter the Princess. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also find some treasure chests but also washrooms require a special key (of course). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So head out into the town and find the usual N.P.C.s, Shops, and the Inn. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start with some money but no equipments or spells. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So first thing is to buy some stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And yes, "Final Fantasy" does make you pay for spells. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your Mages need to buy each spell at the white and black magic shops. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Heal and Fire are good starter spells. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, different classes can equip [only] certain weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As a rule, heavy armor and swords are used for the physical attackers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And weak armor (daggered wands and hammers) for the magic users. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to check the manual to figure out who can equip what. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game, itself, won't tell you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Final Fantasy"'s menu screens are [pretty] good. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's [pretty] simple to trade items and to equip 'em. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All your characters are found on one screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't have to, like, switch back and forth to equip stuff on every single character. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you've taken care of all that it's time to head out onto the overworld, which has the typical "Dragon Quest" layout. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the one area in which final "Final Fantasy" makes a huge jump over "Dragon Quest (I)"s the combat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather than the typical first-person view, "Final Fantasy" lays everything sideways. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each party member can select a specific monster to attack. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This allows you to battle much more strategically. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, by having the strong fighters attack separate monsters and having weaker members ganging up on one particular monster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will allow you to take out monsters one by one, if you want to. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the big frustrations of combat in "Phantasy Star" was that numbers would attack random monsters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also organize your party members with the strongest on top, the members on top are more likely to take hits so you can protect your mages lower but you didn't down towards the bottom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, keeping your majors alive is gonna be, sort of, one of the more difficult things early on in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole 'rescue the Princess' plot has already become, sort of, cliche in Fantasy games by this point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Final Fantasy" subverts the whole thing by having you rescue the Princess, first thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the first boss of the game, Garland, is encountered immediately. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm actually gonna start putting him at Level 2, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's almost like an entire little mini R.P.G. before the game really starts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily Garland is [pretty] easy so you don't have to do too much leveling before you take him on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you've rescued the Princess the grateful King builds a bridge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the real game starts! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The delayed title screen must have been quite surprising the first time anyone played this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it does serve, sort of, increase that building up epic scope to the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Like 'Wow, I've been playing for a half hour and the real game is just now starting!'). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌠 Final Fantasy's History ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's talk a little bit about "Final Fantasy" is history. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably the most repeated video game related tale on the internet is that of Square's teetering on the edge of bankruptcy after the non-success of the do do label. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sakaguchi decided to give it a games one last try a fantasy game called "Final Fantasy". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either because square would collapse financially after this game, or alternately, Sakaguchi was going to quit video games and it wasn't success. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Lo and behold "Final Fantasy" was a huge hit, Square became the premiere maker of console R.P.G.s, and "Final Fantasy" became the biggest R.P.G. series ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I guess well this could be true I suppose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, it was interesting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Square had actually planned an earlier gigantic R.P.G. for the FamiCom Disk System - "Seiken Densetsu: The Emergence of Excalibur". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game was advertised but never actually created. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Final Fantasy", sort of, filled the hole caused by that game's cancellation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As for "Final Fantasy"'s success, well, it did do [pretty] well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Reportedly the original release sold about 400,000 copies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] solid! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What about the earlier games from the "Final Fantasy" team? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "3D WorldRunner" supposedly sold 500,000 copies! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And "Rad Racer", almost 2 million copies! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Say what? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I thought all of Square's earlier titles had been flops! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Final Fantasy" wasn't even their best selling title? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, Square didn't release the U.S. version themselves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So presumably it was the Japanese release of "Final Fantasy" that brought in so much needed cash. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While "Final Fantasy" is popular in the U.S., it's virtually a state religion in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Consider this: In 2006 'Famitsu' (the biggest Japanese gaming magazine) polled its readers on the best games of all time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Final Fantasy' placed four games in the Top 10, with "Final Fantasy X" and "...VII" taking top honors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Dragon Quest' was right behind with three titles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's amazing the way these two games dominate Japanese gamers' hearts! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now what about the other three? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While there was "Machi" (a Visual Novel for the PlayStation), "Tactics Ogre" (sort of a surprise choice), and "...Ocarina of Time". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The, uh, 'Famitsu' list is quite odd in many ways and we'll actually come back to it a little bit later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Final Fantasy" was remade and re-published quite a few times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the most well-known as the PlayStation version of "Final Fantasy Origins". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe it's the best way to play the game, for those allergic to 8-bit graphics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the severely neutered version was released for the Game Boy Advance as "Final Fantasy: Dawn of Souls". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# "Final Fantasy" (Review Resumes) ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now going back to the game itself, after some wandering around, much like in "Dragon Quest II", you say, 'Hey, I'm just sorta stuck on a big island!'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, you'll encounter some wussy pirates and take their ship, just like an "Ultima III". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sure, nine pirates look like a lot but these guys are big wusses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Special sea monsters will appear in the random battles when you're traveling on the oceans. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, of course, you can explore around, find some new towns, that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Final Fantasy" tries to create a more vibrant living world than that of "Dragon Quest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead of just, sort of, like, the typical towns you encounter, there's actually a lot of stuff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's an underground city of dwarves, a witch's cave, a city of elves, a dragon King - all of which will assist you if you perform some task for them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, remember this guy? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's this, sort of, somewhat complicated interlocking series of side quests involving finding a witch's eye, awakening an elf King who was put to sleep with a curse, this dude who wants a crown hidden in a cave, and a dwarf who needs TNT. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this next cave is probably the first truly challenging part of the game, where you'll encounter group after group of tough monsters, which frequently like to put, sort of, bad status effects on your party. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The undead creatures tend to paralyze you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Fortunately, your Mages' magic are [pretty] effective against Zombies and that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, your magic is very limited. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other R.P.G. is used status effects, but "Final Fantasy" really goes whole hog. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can be blinded, put to sleep, silenced, paralyzed, poisoned, and (worst of all) turned to stone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both Poison and Stone are permanent status effects until your character is cured. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Poison, in particular, tends to happen a lot, near the beginning of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have potions to cure poison but if you run out while you're in a dungeon, you're in trouble. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if your poisoned party member dies, you'll need to fight your way back through the dungeon, across the overworld, and into town. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, unlike "Phantasy Star", there are no items to instantly transport you back to town. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Final Fantasy" is quite brutal and not always fair. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here you see three of my party members have been poisoned - not an uncommon occurrence in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll come across some magic that will cure poison, but not yet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bottom line is: Buy a lot of poison antidotes before heading into a dungeon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After obtaining the herb to wake up the elf King, he'll give you the Magic Key. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this is, sort of, one of those truly rewarding moments in "Final Fantasy", as you can now go back to all the previous caves and castles and open up all those locked doors and get mad loot and fantastic weapon and armor upgrades. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Final Fantasy", sort of, runs hot and cold. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When it's not being sadistically cruel, it can be very generous. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll definitely want to head back to the dwarf cave and go into this locked room... and get some brand spanking new armor. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the one area in which "Final Fantasy" really excels is in the character and monster design. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, sure, most monsters are taken directly out of Dungeons and Dragons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the art goes well beyond your typical R.P.G. skeletons and slimes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is probably due a lot to the work of, uh, Yoshitaka Amano. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really he took video game illustration to a whole new level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, Toriyama's work on "Dragon Quest" was great, but still done a rather simple comic book style. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you take a look at the covers that Amano did, they're all really fantastic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He brought a high level of craft to his work is very fluid drawing style more resembles some of those great illustrators of the early 20th century, rather than a comic book artist. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now "Final Fantasy" has ribbit GUI New Age plot that involves, uh, four mistake orbs that you have to rescue from for themes who are destroying the harmony of the universe or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's perhaps a more ambitious storyline than your typical 'kill the evil wizard' thing found in most R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the very first theme, the Lich, the fiend of the earth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After him, you need to take on the themes of fire, water and air. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So from here on out, you're, sort of, out there exploring the world, Leveling Up buying better armor and magic, which can actually get quite expensive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually, everything is kind of expensive and final things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've seen the basic heal potions are like 60 Gold each. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even worse the soft potions (the one that cure 'Stone') like 800 Gold each. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the higher level is magic or rageous ly expensive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here [only] on level six, and everything cost 20,000 Gold. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now after this point you will obtain a canoe, which we like to travel on rivers, which will allow you to find a volcano where the fire fiend lives. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, once you're inside of volcano, the game ratchets up the difficulty quite a bit - as the book and it was huge, hard to navigate. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And large sections of floor covered by lava, which causes damage at each step. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sure, there was a little bit of this in "Dragon Quest II" but not nearly to the extent of this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Difficult enemies will often be encountered when you open chests, such as these things the elements. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the fire Mr. noodle kind like recurring theme and the 'Final Fantasy' games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now another level to "Final Fantasy" is combat system is the elemental properties of magic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Many monsters are weak to a particular kind of magic spell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fire monsters take damage from a spills, undead creatures take damage from fire, steep creatures from lightning. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A vastly more complex magic system is one of the ways in which "Final Fantasy" improves on its predecessors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Dragon Quest' had 13 spells, "Phantasy Star" had 18; "Final Fantasy" has 64. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have every variety: damage, support, spells to inflict statuses on enemies, spells to speed up your characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By far the most intensive use of magic in a video game R.P.G. we've seen so far. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though the magic system is quite odd. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have a limited number of 'charges' for each level of magic - and there's a total of eight levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You get more charges as you Level Up, but with all the early Japanese R.P.G.s he never really seemed to have enough magic (especially healing magic!). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It is extremely easy to run out of useful spells in the middle of the dungeon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, after finding the clue, that it games next major breakthrough occurs here when you find the greatest piece of transportation in R.P.G. history: the airship. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, you can now apply anywhere in the world with no encounters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, this is one of the great moments in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Suddenly we have all this freedom of movement. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Places that appear on the map are now reachable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And yes, "Final Fantasy" actually does come with an end game map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's one of those features that makes a finally an R.P.G. with a map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's great to be able to play an R.P.G. and finally know where exactly you are. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 With the airship, you can still start exploring around, you'll come across these islands. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To get another awesome surprise, you go inside, you'll find it underground to the dragons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now aside from some treasure chest, you'll find the King of dragons himself, Bahamut. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Technically speaking, Bahamut is a giant sea creature, or a fish the Arabic equivalent of Behemoth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But 'D&D' turned them into a dragon, so here he is, as a dragon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's Othello that would keep turning up in 'Final Fantasy' games, usually as a summon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, Bahamut wants you to prove your courage to him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you have to find this thing called the rat tail, hidden inside the castle aboard deals. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now once you've done this, you can return to Him And he will grant you a class change. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mages will become wizards, fighters become knights, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can now learn more spells and equip better weapons and armor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The thief, in particular, becomes much more useful after being upgraded to a ninja. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's suddenly able to equip decent armor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a real pleasure to watch your defense attacks have suddenly shoot up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (One problem is the mages don't look quite as cute anymore.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fine, I can put all the silver armor on my ninja. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the fiend of fire is carry. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that's good another mangling of the name Kali. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose it's better than 'Curly' in "magic of shirzad". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bosses can be tough but capable of dishing out huge damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When facing some of these guys, defensive magic is really where it's at. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A Fire will protect you from her fire attacks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, the Fast spell will allow your knight to double the number of hits he has per attack. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 These boss fights are not simply about hitting attack over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You really need to make intelligent it's your Magic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In "Dragon Quest II" and "Phantasy Star" the boss pedals for mostly just about hitting the enemy with the strongest taxi have. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But here you, sort of, have to know specific techniques in order to beat the bosses easily. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now after the fire feign, no need to go to an underwater temple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But first of all, you actually have to buy an extremely expensive bottle containing a ferry that allow you to breathe underwater. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, 50,000 goals. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kind of like the passport in "Phantasy Star". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you get to travel, by submarine, to later have the water feed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now at some point "Final Fantasy" does become a bit easier going. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the water template is not as tough as the earth or the volcano in my opinion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think, for me, the turning point was finding the heel staff and the Zeus gauntlet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are magical items that lie to cast heel and thunder every battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your mages magic is so limited in quantity they have to use it really sparingly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And being able to cast magic spells no cost and magical points maybe the huge difference. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The fact that I don't have decent armor for the Ninja and wizards is also helpful. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're not almost always on the verge of death. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But of course, as you saw a second ago, one hit kills are still not that common. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All the 'Final Fantasy' games, they have some Science-Fiction themes, this one included. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will encounter a town populated by a once technologically advanced people. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They'll direct it to the floating sky castle, a product of last technology - essentially a space station. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here you'll encounter to mop the airfield there's tons of chests till the armor and weapons and upgrades. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now one thing you can find is the metal needed to go back to that dwarf and create Excalibur - the second most powerful sword in the game (the most powerful being masa Mooney). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These two sorts pair over and over again 'Final Fantasy' games, usually as the best weapons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another recurring feature of "Final Fantasy" found here: the secret super tough boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is this guy called war mag, who when he attacks the color dishes out of total about 643 points of damage in one turn. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Beating this guy is more a matter of luck than anything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, after you've collected all the four orbs, turns out there's another evil force behind the whole thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to head back to the very first dungeon and travel back 2000 years in time and face garlin, who's created some kind of, like, crazy timely. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The true final boss is Chaos, which is, sort of, a garland combined with the powers of the fourth teens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] tough but not as bad as warmack. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, finding it he will dish out quite a bit of damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But plenty of chaos, well then 'Congratulations!', you've beaten the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Final Fantasy" was quite an accomplishment for Square, technically a 'Dragon Quest' clone but one that makes huge improvements to the 'Dragon Quest' formula (better use of magic much more stuff to find). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Final Fantasy" total of 40 weapons "Dragon Quest II" had 18, I believe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A combat system with more depth and much more player freedom due the different character classes in a customizable party. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course this does Sacrifice any, sort of, characterization on the part of your characters, however. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game does randomly throw down some unfair moments at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing like having your entire party paralyzed and then watching the monsters tear them to shreds. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And naturally quiet they're grinding is involved in spots. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are some programming bugs spells don't work as they should. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But considering Square's history, the fact they could make an R.P.G. of this caliber is [pretty] amazing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The success of "Final Fantasy" cars were, sort of, switched directions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead of making games like "Rad Racer". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They now made a lot of R.P.G.s they went to work on a sequel to "Final Fantasy" [pretty] quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It would actually come out next year in 1988. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Final Fantasy' would become one of the biggest selling franchises in videogame history. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe it's currently the fifth biggest selling video game franchise of all time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Today, "Final Fantasy" is still a game worth playing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe one thing you won't quite grasp from this video is how brutally difficult the game can be in spots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Phantasy Star", there's a real feeling of tension in "Final Fantasy" -, especially when you're in the dungeons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it feels you feel like your entire party could be killed at any given time (which, of course, is true; it can). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, regardless of the difficulty, "Final Fantasy" is really the most impressive R.P.G. we've seen for the FamiCom, so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's, sort of, indication as the direction that R.P.G.s would eventually be going. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mezase Pachi Pro: Pachio-kun 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Marionette 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Coconuts Japan 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, now let's move on to the 'what the hell' category with a little game we call "Mezase Pachi Pro: Pachio-kun". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The title could be translated as 'to be Apache Pro', or that is a professional Pachinko player. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's quite a goal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the first FamiCom game from the horribly-named company, Coconuts Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Coconuts, now defunct, specialized in Sports and Gambling titles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is the first game to feature pop geocoding hoops Comes with coconuts mascot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There were a surprising number of pot geocoin games (more than there should have been) with the utterly bizarre "American Dream" being the most well-known over, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Was a patio Pro is a Pachinko game, but not just any Pachinko game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, your goal is Poncho clean is to beat every Pachinko machine in the parlor. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For those who aren't familiar with Pachinko, it's, sort of, one of Japan's major bad habits. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It involves a shooting a little ball bearings into a Pachinko machine machine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, keep the ball bearings unless the ball lands in the right slot and then you win more ball bearings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The goal is to come out with more ball bearings and you went in with. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The kinko is not officially gambling so you can't redeem the ball bearings for cash - except that, in reality, you can. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So all you need to do to play in this game is deceptive machine and start playing Pachinko. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (For some reason, the idea of a giant within Pachinko ball trying to win normal size Pachinko balls is a little odd to me.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To beat a machine need to empty out all the balls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This might take a while. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Good luck. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The D-Pad controls the pressure with which the balls are sent out and the button shoots one ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also inspect the pins on the machine closely, though I'm not really sure how that's going to help you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is there actually some sort of art to blank Pachinko? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Presumably. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One interesting thing about the puck Shoku games - according to Game Developer Research Institute, they were developed by Marionette, who we've already encountered. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They've done some games for Pony Canyon like "Dr. Chaos". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the name C-Dream appears on the title screens. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who exactly worse the dream? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I wish I knew. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, some folks (perhaps noting the game's poor quality) have connected Color Dreams to the pot geocoding titles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, both the Wikipedia article on "American Dream" and GameFAQs lists Color Dreams as a developer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But Color Dreams a U.S. based company was not formed until either 1988 or 1989. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's absolutely no reason to believe they will do envelop work for coconuts, even if they were around in 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the similarity in names is just a coincidence. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the game seems ridiculous to me, but if you love Pachinko, then hey, go ahead and check it out. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 Famitsu Top 100 Games of All Time 2006 Readers Poll ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As promised, let's go back to that crazy 'Top 100 Games of All Time' list, as voted by the readers of Famitsu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The list is generally strange to any Western game fan, but might give us a bit of insight into the mindset of the typical Japanese committed gamer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Final Fantasy' and 'Dragon Quest' dominate the list, but even those games placement is a bit odd, from our perspective. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest V" seems to be the most highly regarded of the 2D 'Dragon Quest' games, despite not even being released over here until recently. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yet it doesn't even quite make the Top 10, being, uh, beaten by "Dragon Quest III" and amazingly "Dragon Quest VII" (a game that is considered kind of boring and poorly designed in the West). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you ask anyone you know what the best 2D 'Final Fantasy' game is? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, 9 out of 10 will say "Final Fantasy VI" is an undisputed masterpiece of 16-bit R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it comes in here at Number 25 - well below "Final Fantasy IV" and "... V", the other two Super FamiCom 'Final Fantasy's. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And incredibly, despite the fact of the Japanese love Square and R.P.G.s, the game which here we consider the, sort of, the pinnacle of the Japanese R.P.G. (and one of the best 16-bit games of all time), "Chrono Trigger", turns up at number 26. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's [only] four spots above "Final Fantasy X-2". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seriously? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Looking at the list, Square Enix and Nintendo completely dominate. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What about the other companies? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The big names are all there but not for the games you might expect. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sega? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, those guys who make those Dating Sims and 'Virtua Fighter'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though 'Sonic the Hedgehog' does barely make the top 50 at number 49. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot of the Sega games that might make a similar list here in the United States, such as the 'Shining Force' games or the 'Panzer Dragoon' games, 'Phantasy Star', 'Shenmue', those sorts of things - all missing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Capcom is not exactly really well represented. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mostly it's on there for "Street Fighter II" and the 'Resident Evil' games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami does a little bit better with "mekki Memorial" and the 'Metal Gear' titles making showings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, "Metal Gear Solid" (a game with a huge reputation in the U.S. as perhaps the best PlayStation game) shows up at number 50. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even crazier "Metal Gear Solid 2" is number 42. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, apparently Japan likes "Metal Gear Solid" to better than "Metal Gear Solid". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What's missing from list? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, not surprisingly, Western-developed games are almost entirely absent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's no First-Person Shooters, no Real-Time Strategy Games, or Adventure Games, or even modern Western R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So forget about "Half-Life" and "Civilization", "Baldur's Gate", and all that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not even "GoldenEye" or "Donkey Kong Country" makes the list. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The ones that a... -- do are "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City" at #76, "SimCity" at #93, and (believe it or not) "Wizardry" at #66. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose the absence of Western games is understandable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But what about certain classic Japanese games? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are some choices here there are, sort of, battling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Mega Man"? Nowhere to be found. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Castlevania"? Nope. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not even "Symphony the Night"! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another game you think would be on the 'best PlayStation game ever' shortlist. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Metroid"? No. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Super Metroid", the greatest ever Super Nintendo title? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, no, it's not, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "SoulCalibur", "Ninja Gaiden" "Contra", "Star Fox"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nope, none of those. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another guy who fares worse than you might think is (believe it or not) Mario. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Super Mario Bros." places very high and "Super Mario World" is, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But "Super Mario ... 3"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Believe it or not, it's at number 99 on the list. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Missing is "Super Mario 64" and weirdly "Super Mario R.P.G.". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese seem to love Square and Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But together? I guess not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 None of the later regular '...Mario' games or any of the Mario R.P.G. games make the list. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, to make this all relevant to 'Chrontendo' here are the FamiCom games actually made the list. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The console did [pretty] well - 18 titles out of 100. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both "Dragon Quest III" and "Final Fantasy" make the Top 10. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then in the next 10, we have "Dragon Quest II" (certainly not a bad game) and "Super Mario Bros." coming at number 21. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the original "Dragon Quest II" lower down at number 30. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then kind of strangely "Mother" (that's, sort of, known to us "Earthbound 0") Nintendo's R.P.G. at number 38. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...Legend of "...Zelda", a mere 46. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then some oddities. "Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II" make the list. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Right below that is "Final Fantasy II" and "Final Fantasy I" at number 63. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (It's odd that in Japan they seem to like "Final Fantasy II" better than the first one.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A little bit later, we have "Pro Yakou "Family Stadium". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's Namco's Baseball Game (known as "RBI Baseball" in the West). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Wizardry" (oddly enough). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Hokkaido renta set Sujin" (that's the Enix-developed Adventure Game we saw a few episodes ago). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Best Play Pro Yakou" (a Baseball Game from ASCII). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Kung-Fu", believe it or not (that's the "Spartan X" game). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Pro Yakou "Family Stadium" '87", "Gradius", and "Super Mario Bros. 3". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, "Kung-Fu" is apparently a better game than the "Super Mario Bros. 3". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously tastes it's all relative, but try figuring that one out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what does all this mean? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess it means we've actually got another Top 100 game coming up next. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 22 🇯🇵 // 1990 July [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sir-tech | Game Studio 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 // Nexoff 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, we've reached our final game today and it's a port of one of the original R.P.G.s, "Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord", released by ASCII in Japan and NexSoft in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] fancy title screen, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original game was by Andrew Greenberg and Robert Woodhead first published by whiteheads company, Sir Tech in 1981. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Wixardry" was possibly the first Sir Tech game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They continued to exist and release games until the late '90s, I think. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Wizardry" is very much an old old-school R.P.G. (literally one of the first video game R.P.G.s created). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As such, it's based heavily on "Dungeons and Dragons". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to create your party before you can go anywhere. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike most Japanese R.P.G.s, you need to abide by the 'D&D' rules, such as choosing a race, alignment, assigning bonus points, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The classes are quite similar to those in "Final Fantasy". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have your Fighters, Mages, Thieves, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Wizardry", along with "Ultima", was one of the American R.P.G.s that inspired such games as "Dragon Quest" and "Final Fantasy". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though obviously, many of the elements in these games were simplified when designing console R.P.G.s for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, what we have here is [pretty] much undiluted "Wizardry", very little was changed for this port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you're getting [pretty] much the full, unpleasant, antique R.P.G. experience. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While there are Shops, an inn, a Church, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Modern gamers might be horrified to find that these exist in a text-based menu [only]. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is no, sort of, graphical depiction of anything outside the dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no N.P.C.s, dialogue, characterization, or really any of that - just straight dungeon crawling. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So once you got your party together, you head off into the 'maze' (as "Wizardry" calls it) and start slaying monsters and exploring. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, that's a genuinely slimy looking slime. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not like one of those cute little blobs from "Dragon Quest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a very unmarketable slime. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And yes, every single treasure chest that you get is possibly booby trapped. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can attempt to disarm the trap, but there's a high chance of getting some sort of debilitating status ailment every single time you open a chest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now "Wizardry" has been released and ported countless times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The very first version was the 1981 Apple II release (a horribly ugly game, I might add). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was released in this slightly? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Better looking version for DOS in 1984. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shortly afterwards, there was a Commodore 64 release, a Macintosh release... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Wizardry" came to Japanese computers as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, is the MX two port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, we got the FamiCom game as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All these older releases had wireframes maze walls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the FamiCom version was ported by game studio and used "Deep Dungeon"-style solid walls. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, one interesting thing - There actually is a menu option, um, in the FamiCom version to switch to the wireframe walls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you wanted a real, sort of, old-fashioned authentic "Wizardry" experience. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can even turn off the two modern frivolities such as music and sound effects. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the Option Screen, right here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now really, all of these versions that we've seen are virtually identical other than the graphics department. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually reworked and more modernized versions, republished for the P.C. Engine, the Saturn, the PlayStation, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game has really been around a number of times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the FamiCom version, as I mentioned, was ported by game studio that was massive oboe induced company. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's the guy who was behind "Xevious" and "...Tower of Druaga". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While "Wizardry" was one of the most renowned Computer R.P.G.s back in the early '80s, by the end of the decade and, sort of, lost its luster in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might recall we saw wizard before for Apple II a couple episodes back in the 1987 P.C. Game Round-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember how dated that game was? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The series stopped being cutting-edge [pretty] quickly into its lifespan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last what you I guess you would call regular 'Wizardry' game, uh, what from Sir Tech was "Wizardry VIII" in 2001. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But in Japan the series took on a life of its own with various spin-offs like the Game Boy 'Wizardry Gaiden' games or the 'Wizardry Empire' series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot of publishers have been involved - ASCII, Capcom, StarFish. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The most recent was a D.S. title that came out... well, I guess a couple of weeks ago in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, is one such, uh, Japanese title: "Wizardry Summoner" for the Game Boy Advance. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was published Media Ranks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the most notorious game that they ever published was "Toilet Kids" for the P.C. Engine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure why this series changed hands so many times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you recall was remade the funny to readers Top 100 list beating "Super Mario ... 3". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So clearly, they really love this game in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you try playing it today... well, who knows if you like it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It can be infuriating as heck! . 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's easy to get killed and way too expensive to revive or heal party -- party characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Staying in an inn, for example, cost 10 Gold pieces per Hit Point per character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Curing a character of poison cost 100 Gold. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Considering how little money you rake in killing monsters, this is utterly ridiculous! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is not huge (10 floors) and your character can [only] go to Level 7. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there are lots of spells, tons of armor and weapons... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... I can't always say I recommend this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 99% of R.P.G. fans today would consider to be, sort of, dull, and repetitive, and unbalanced. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, for those interested in very early R.P.G. history, I guess you might give it a go. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 26 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow! what a huge episode! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've reached December 22nd, but we've still got seven more games left in 1987. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then, next episode will begin the brand new year of 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, next episode, we do have one very special game from Konami - the game, in,fact, that kicked off Konami's greatest video game series. 🍇🍌
