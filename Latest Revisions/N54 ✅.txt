👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 54 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here we are, back again with a new episode of 'Chrontendo', this time covering December 1989 through January 1990. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We have some really terrible games here, so this is gonna be kind of rough going today. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, there are a few announcements to make. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, "...Episode 54" is going to be the last episode of 'Chrontendo' ...that covers 15 games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Starting next episode, each episode will cover 10 games. 🍇


✅🏮🍊🍓 At this point, I've had it up to here with these hour-and-a-half-long videos. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Reducing the number of games will allow me to make these things faster. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, just so you know, YouTube lets me see everything! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I know you guys [only] watch the first half-hour of these videos. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, it was mentioned in the last 'Chronturbo' episode, but once again I'll announce there is now officially a Chrontendo Patreon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'll start putting the link in the descriptions of these videos. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Any patrons who want their names added to the list of patrons in the credits, just send me a message on Patreon, s... stating how you want your name to be listed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, I guess I'm supposed to tell you guys to Like and Subscribe and there's also supposedly a Bell button that you should press (or that's what YouTubers always say). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One last thing - this video has been created using a new rendering process so I'm hoping it looks a little better (assuming that YouTube's own rendering doesn't make it look like crud). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so let's get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 FamiCom Yakyuu Ban 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 15 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SAS Sakata
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Epoch 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I have a rather shocking piece of news for you, dear listeners; I am not perfect and I do make mistakes and it's been brought to my attention that I skipped a game from December 15th - a Baseball Game which isn't too surprising, because there were (like, what?) five - six Baseball Games in December. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here it is - "FamiCom Yakyuu Ban". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is a rather grandiose title screen for such an unassuming little game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We get various gameplay options here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These are great little illustrations. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was developed by Sakata S.A.S. and published by Epoch - the first Epoch game for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Sakata S.A.S. was, I believe, mostly involved in game programming, rather than creative decisions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've seen them do a lot of stuff for Data East, like the port of "Karnov". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing about this game - the team lineup is goofier than normal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 FamiCom Baseball Games tend to have, like, silly fake names for the teams but this goes above and beyond the norm. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, yeah this is just a regular Baseball Game, right? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But there is a weird concept behind the game - at least sort of. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you guys know what 'yakyuu' is, right? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's 'baseball' - but what is 'yakyuu ban'? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, that is simply the Japanese name for what we call baseball pinball games - that is, a small Baseball Game toy that works like a pinball table. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The ball is propelled by a spring and can be hit with a flipper - at least on the fancier models, like this one, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Smaller cheaper versions are much simpler. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, these things have been popular in Japan for ages, so the idea of a yakyuu ban video game makes sense. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this one was manufactured by Epoch, who was actually a Japanese toy company, founded in 1958. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the mid-'70s "Pong" was all the rage and in 1975 Epoch released the T.V. Tennis ElectroTennis - the first Japanese video game console, though Epoch didn't actually manufacture this themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 They soon started to develop various video game systems such as the 'T.V.Vader', which was simply a "Space Invaders" clone, with the joystick built right into the console. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As well as this, there was the 'Cassette Vision' followed by the 'Super Cassette Vision', which was released in 1984 (so, shortly after the FamiCom). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 About 30 games were released between '84 and '86 for this console. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were a number of Arcade Game ports such as "Mappy" - nothing too exciting, as far as I know. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After some time, Epoch withdrew from the console market and here they are now with their first FamiCom game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They released some odd titles - like tons of Doremon games [and] a couple of Disney Super FamiCom games that were never released in the U.S. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Epoch no longer makes video games now but seems to still have a relationship with Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Their main product line seems to be a series of cute little animal figures called the Sylvanian Families but they also make stuff like Super Mario toys and, um, B.T.S. jigsaw puzzles(?). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, anyway, going back to the game, it's a very normal Baseball Game and it looks almost identical to Namco's "Family Stadium" games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If we just, sort of, superimpose the two - well, you... you see what I mean. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one odd quirk - the first time I've played this I was just getting my ass kicked by the other team ([pretty] much like every other Baseball Game I've played on this series). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But later I played with different teams and suddenly the C.P.U. was just an imbecile - getting struck out, failing to catch balls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Typically, every ball you hit in these things just goes 'Blam!' right into an outfielder's glove but not in this case. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So some teams in this game are maybe just bad? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one cool thing: I love the animation where you bean the batter with a pitch. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They really went the extra mile here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, that wraps up Baseball Games until the end of March, I think. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So now let's pick up where we left off, last episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Batman 🇯🇵 // Batman: The Video Game 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 22 🇯🇵 // 1990 February [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sunsoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's move on to our first real game of this episode: "Batman", from Sunsoft, released on December 22nd in Japan and February 1990 in the U.S., under the name "Batman: The Video Game". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It begins with this sort of annoying intro, which uses a lot of flickering effects and sort of runs down the plot of the movie, complete with pixelated recreations of Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you undoubtedly know, this is the official video game adaptation of the smash hit 1989 movie, courtesy of the dubious talents of the guy who made the wet t-shirt Jaws movie and Barbra Streisand's former hairdresser/boyfriend. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Batman' the movie took a while to get made; the producers bought the movie rights in 1979 and while 'Batman' itself wasn't that great of a picture, the marketing campaign was phenomenal and it could be said that 'Batman' the movie more or less created the modern Hollywood blockbuster. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now one side-effect of its success was that it knocked loose a lot of money for other stalled comic book adaptations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So suddenly Warren Beatty's old 'Dick Tracy' project got funded and we'll be seeing video game adaptations of these post-'Batman' comic book movies later on in the 'Chrontendo' series. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Batman: The Video Game" is a little weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, let me say "Batman" is a... a quality game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Clearly, time and money went into this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The art direction is fantastic - I mean, just look at these backgrounds! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Look at the lighting on everything in the background. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Batman, himself, looks great; he's, uh, clearly recognizable as Batman and very well animated. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, look at the way his cape moves when he walks; I mean, this is the kind of stuff that gave Sunsoft a great reputation in the late '80s/early '90s. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But it doesn't really feel like a 'Batman' game and it sure doesn't feel like an adaptation of the movie at all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It has some of the dark shadowy atmosphere of the movie, but that's about it; there aren't really any recognizable locations from the film. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first level is a city level (which I guess makes sense) but then we move into, like, a rather vaguely science fiction industrial compound of some sort (the kind of thing you might see in "Contra" or "Bionic Commando"?) and these sections feel more like a sci-fi "Castlevania". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 None of the enemies are taken from the movie either, with the exception of the Joker, who is the final boss and, uh, he has a, uh, a lightning attack(?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the background in the final boss scene does look like a church tower so that is basically the one part of this game that clearly references the movie. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this really isn't at all true of the other 'Batman' games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, the computer version from Ocean Software is completely different and very clearly based on the movie. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, you can clearly recognize Tracey Walter's character as the... the Joker's henchman in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So the question is, I mean, 'Is "Batman: The Video Game" any good?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, Lord knows, the kids liked it back in 1990. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It feels sort of like a slower version of "Ninja Gaiden" (mostly due to Batman wall-jumping a lot) though this seems more like 'Spiderman' than 'Batman', in my opinion. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For attacking, Batman can punch, of course. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He also has three ranged weapons; obviously, there's the Batarang (which is presumably non-lethal unless you take one to the windpipe or the eye). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, this game makes the very unusual choice to give Batman a gun, which he uses to straight-up kill people with. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Batman' lore says he never uses a gun and doesn't kill people and yeah, you guys have given me examples of Batman killing people, like in "Batman Returns", when he sticks this thing of dynamite on some henchman's chest and blows him up but still, this is the [only] 'Batman' game I can think of where Batman shoots people. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The manual says it's a 'Spear Gun' which is, quite frankly, probably even worse than being shot by a bullet. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Batman also shoots three tiny missiles at enemies which, again, sounds [pretty] lethal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The manual calls this a 'Dirk' for some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Other weird factors: So, other than the Joker, none of the game's enemies, like, really seem to come from the 'Batman' comics, but in the manual, they've all been given names of 'Batman' villains. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And they had to dig up some obscure ones! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, this flying guy is supposed to be the 'Killer Moth' (who was really more of a 'Batgirl' villain, by this point) and guys like 'Deadshot' and 'The Electrocutioner'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Again, the sprites look nothing like the actual comic book characters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So this is... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of all the 'Batman' video games, this is the one that is really, like, the least, sort of, 'Batman'-ish. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you replace Batman's sprite with something else, you would never guess this was 'Batman'-related. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even the Batarang isn't bat-shaped. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All of this certainly leads me to believe that the 'Batman' license was added on relatively late in the development process and that this was originally going to be some completely different property. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So "Batman" is certainly a well-loved N.E.S. game but, as someone who didn't play it back when it first came out, to me it just feels like there is way too much annoying bullshit and it feels too repetitive, especially coming right after playing "Castlevania III" (a game which was tough, but it never felt cheap and seemed to offer something new on every screen). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For me, that's just not the case with "Batman" and I simply don't have the patience or the inclination to deal with this game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Chuugoku Janshi Story - Tonpuu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 23 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Zap
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Natsume 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 December 23rd and (aren't we in luck?) a Mahjong Game - this one published by Natsume - "Chuugoku Janshi Story - Tonpuu" (or "Chinese Sparrow Stone - East Wind"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The word 'mahjong' comes from the Chinese word for 'sparrow'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'East wind' refers to the position of the dealer, who plays first. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The menu screen has a few options in regard to the game rules. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You also have the ability to turn off the music and sound effects. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For this, we'll just leave the music on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a tournament game and guess who's not going to be winning the gold cup. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's right; me. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This all looks - [pretty] typical here - just a standard Mahjong Game, from the looks of it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, I will point out the developer is a company called 'Zap'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were mostly a developer of computer games for the M.S.X. and such. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We have seen one other game from them a while ago: "Ankoku Shinwa", which was an Adventure Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There was one game from them that got a western release, which is actually a TurboGrafx-16, uh, Shoot-em-Up, called "Dead Moon". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Zap developed a number of other titles - the most notable of which may have been "Twinkle Tale" - one of the rarer and most expensive Mega Drive games (though you can find plenty of cheap reproduction carts online). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, there's really nothing unique about this particular game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just another of the many many Mahjong Games on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Herakles no Eikou II 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 23 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We have two J.R.P.G.s today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess late winter/early spring is R.P.G. season in Japan, so we're, sort of, kinda getting warmed up here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Hercules no Eikou II" from Data East (or technically 'Herakles'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the second game in the "Herakles no Eikou" series as you probably figured out from the name. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, like most FamiCom R.P.G.s, this was not released outside of Japan but we have a [pretty] slick translation from 'SpoonyBard' that will allow us to slog our way through this thing if we wanted to. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as you will have noticed, this game looks extremely 8-bit R.P.G.-ish; this is, like, very much absolutely boilerplate N.E.S.-era R.P.G. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You are called upon to save the world from 'Demons' or 'Titans' or something. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In order to start your quest, you actually need to go into your house and check your bed for an invisible letter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The letter is from the Queen, who needs you to assist with the war on the Lord of Darkness. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So your mom gives you Dad's old sword and shield (which are crap and you should get rid of them as soon as possible). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you make your way to the Queen, she gives you an update on the war with the Titans and says she needs you to go to Athens and find Homer (yes, Homer, the guy who wrote the 'Iliad' and the 'Odyssey'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 To get to Athens, you need to go down to the port and hop on a ship, which takes you to Athens, which looks... an awful lot like your hometown. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and in case you're wondering... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So your character is not Hercules; you're just some dumb kid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hercules gets talked about a lot in the game and eventually joins your party, but no, you do not get to play the game as the immortal demigod, Hercules. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, you need to set out into the world and, you know, wander around in circles, grinding for experience points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The translation is [pretty] charming. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You say things like "Taah!" and "There!" when attacking. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One interesting element is the game does utilize a night and day cycle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some buildings will be closed at night and others (like the bar, for example) will be busy at night. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are gonna be unique interactions when in the towns at night. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, later you'll need to poke around a town at night in order to recruit a new party member. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We covered the first 'Hercules' game way back in "Chrontendo #18" and... wow; this did not really hold up visually at all! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At the time, I think that I recall this as the first FamiCom game to explicitly model itself on "Dragon Quest" and it's [pretty] clearly still doing that two-and-a-half years later. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The artwork here has, like, got this vibe of, like, Disneyland's 'It's a Small World' ride. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But on a positive note, you do play as Hercules in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Data East continued to make 'Hercules' games in the '90s with two Super FamiCom titles and one Game Boy entry. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then, all of a sudden, the series was unexpectedly revived by Nintendo with "Glory of Hercules" for the D.S. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Its 2010 release in the U.S. made it the first in the series to be officially released in English. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one little nugget of trivia: The writer on "Glory of Hercules II" is Kazushige Nojima, who later moved to Square and wrote such games as, um, "Final Fantasy VII"... and "VIII"(!)... also "Kingdom Hearts"! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (I guess everyone had to start somewhere.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, as you go through this thing, you'll eventually need to enter a dungeon (or technically a cave) and fight the first boss, Cerberus, the famous three-headed dog - or rather, uh, "Cerbrus", the two-headed dog, in this case. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The developers couldn't afford to hire the real dog, apparently. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like all J.R.P.G.s of this time, dungeons are just absolute nightmare slogs, with random battles happening every two steps. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'd better be stocked up on healing items. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, luckily you get a second party member, before too long. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When you finally track down Homer, he says you need to find the 'Chaos Axe' to defeat the Lord of Darkness but [only] Hercules can wield the axes and Hercules is "in Heaven", as the game says, so yeah, that's... that's definitely a problem. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also in this town, you find a bunch of kids are bullying a centaur and have buried him halfway into the ground. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So... what do do? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, the kids are surrounding him all day, but if you return to the area at night, the kids are home, asleep, and you can free him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your next dungeon crawl takes you to the Minotaur and after defeating him, you'll find the third party member, who's this, uh, statue lady. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Having additional party members can sure help, especially since status elements are gonna be a major problem for you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies that can poison you appear non-stop. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just as bad are those that can put you to sleep and, unlike in some games, you don't wake up when you get hit or when the battle is over; you'll stay asleep permanently until healed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And here's something I don't recall seeing in any other J.R.P.G. of this time - certain monsters can actually break your equipment (like, permanently break it). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once this happens, it's unusable for good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, even by FamiCom R.P.G. standards, this is [pretty] cruel. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, is "Glory of Hercules II" any good? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eh... I mean, it's kind of amusing, especially in the way that it just completely mixes up all these different elements and eras of Greek mythology into, like, a weird stew. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think the later Super FamiCom games are more fondly remembered than this one, however, we do have another J.R.P.G. later in this same episode, which is a bit more interesting. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Rugby 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 27 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Zap
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by TSS 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, this is it: "Super Rugby" - the last game of 1989, released on December 27th. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the first (and, I believe, last) Rugby Game released for the FamiCom, though there was an unrelated game for the Super FamiCom, also called "Super Rugby". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We have a rugby ball in the background, which is very similar in shape to a football, though the ends of a rugby ball are a bit more rounded. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was published by T.S.S. (an extremely minor publisher who [only] released two other console games, to my knowledge: a FamiCom Boxing Game and a P.C. Engine shoot-em-up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now the weird thing is, "Super Rugby" was developed by Zap - the developer of "Chuugoku Janshi Story". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They [only] did three games for the FamiCom (that we know of) and two of them are in today's episode. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Naturally, we have the standard single game mode, tournament mode, and player vs. player modes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm playing as Club A; you can change the team's name if you wish. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This being a game from 1989, there are R.P.G.-type elements added in; you can assign skill points to various attributes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Real quick, let me note the odd detail that your player's photo is attached to the virtual stats page with pieces of scotch tape. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think the thing along the left side is the ring wire binding of a notepad. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your level is 60, which means you can assign 60 points to the various stats, most of which are obvious, except for 'Technique'; I have no idea what that does. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First team up is the Angels and these are some weird names. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Dada'? 'S. Jams'? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Super Rugby is [pretty] obscure, even in Japan; there's very few reviews or videos about this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I did find a couple of Japanese gamers who did brief videos on this, but for the most part, there seems to be very little interest in this game, even in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 To make matters confusing, there is a real-life international rugby league called 'Super Rugby' and Japan is a member of this league, but it was formed in 1996 so this game is obviously not named after it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This plays more or less like most soccer games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One button cycles between the various players on the field and the other button tackles when you're playing defense. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When you have the ball you can either pass or kick... and that's... that's it, really. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're not familiar with rugby, it's in the family of ball games that includes soccer and American football. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All three games derived from some older proto-football game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As rules were formalized and player associations were formed, there ended up being three very distinct football games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Rugby has always been semi-popular in the U.S. but way below football, baseball, and basketball. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I've always associated rugby with, like, prep schools - sort of like lacrosse - a rich kids' sport - maybe the, uh, male equivalent of field hockey. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The one really notable thing about "Super Rugby" is the graphics; they look... weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The players have, like, 1970s-action-figure bodies and they look really stiff. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Check out the animation for scoring a goal. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I am absolutely terrible at this and I can't quite figure out why. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I simply could not tackle; my player would just fly right through the opposing team's guy and never connect. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think I made one successful tackle while playing this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Needless to say, I lost horribly and I had to suffer through the triumphant chanting of the Angels' army. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, 1989 ends not on a bang, but... well, not even a whimper, really. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It ends on a totally forgotten game which is of no interest to anyone, but we do still have to clear the deck of western releases before moving on to 1990. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Silent Service 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Microprose | Rare
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Ultra Games 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, we are done with every Japanese FamiCom release of 1989 and we are now going to finish off this year with some western games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Released sometime in December 1989 was "Silent Service" from Konami - or rather 'Ultra Games'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you might recall, Nintendo of America typically allowed publishers to release [only] five games for the N.E.S. a year. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, a few favored publishers (Konami being one) were allowed to work around the rule by publishing games under their 'Ultra Games' imprint. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Acclaim was also allowed to break the five-per-year rule. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Silent Service" was developed by Rare, who was responsible for, like, about half of the U.S.-exclusive N.E.S. games coming out, at this point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They just pumped these things out at an insane rate. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Quite frankly, this is kind of a weird release. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a somewhat sophisticated submarine simulation game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, you basically use the controller like a mouse, using it to select various options and control your submarine. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This doesn't really feel appropriate for a D-Pad and a two-button controller. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It should probably come as no surprise that this is a port of a computer game, originally published in 1985 by Microprose and designed by Sid Meier. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was released on many many computer platforms - DOS, Amiga, all that stuff. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Meier had made several flight-simulation games in the early-to-mid-'80s and began branching out with submarine games like this and "Red Storm Rising", as well as other types of simulation games, like "Pirates!" in 1987, "Railroad Tycoon" in 1990, and finally "Civilization" in 1991. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A few of these Microprose games got N.E.S. ports, most notably "Pirates!". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As for me, I am really not into this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This seems way too complicated for an N.E.S. game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, just look at all this stuff! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It just seems weird and inappropriate playing a game like this with an N.E.S. controller. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, just look at the manual for this thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It goes on and on; it's insane! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here's the short version; there are three game modes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Convoy Actions (where you hunt down [and] attack convoys) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 and War Patrols (the most involved mode where you gallivant all over the ocean and attack enemy ships). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's a bunch of gameplay options which will increase or decrease the difficulty. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, throughout the game, you're gonna be controlling the ship - diving, surfacing, keeping an eye on the ship's condition, making repairs, and, of course, engaging enemy ships and trying to sink them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have both a turret gun of some sort, as well as, of course, torpedoes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's nothing really wrong with "Silent Service"; it's just not my cup of tea. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure some kids really dug it back then but I just can't get into it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Championship Bowling 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Another
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Athena 🇯🇵 // Romstar 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's another un-dated U.S. release: "Championship Bowling", published by Romstar, which was S.N.K.'s U.S. distribution arm (though they also handled U.S. distribution for other Japanese companies as well). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They released games like "Side Arms", "Arkanoid 2", "Tiger Road", "Rambo III". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the second Romstar game for the N.E.S. that we've seen (the first being "Twin Eagle" - a vertical shoot-em-up that we covered in Episode 50). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, first of all, let's point out: this guy is packing! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nice of this game to throw in a little something for the ladies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the woman here appears to be flipping us off, for some reason(?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If we add in the bizarre appearance of a penguin and a rabbit for no reason, we get a really weird title screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so let's select our character. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no difference between these four (aside from their appearance) with one exception: the blonde guy; he is left-handed, while the other three are all right-handed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the one thing that does make a big difference is the weight of the ball that you choose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have five options, ranging from seven to fifteen pounds. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the heavier balls will hit the pins with more power and the lighter balls will be able to be thrown in a more dramatic curve. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It'll be much harder to get a good curve on the heavier balls. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Championship Bowling" is a completely un-offensive bowling game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's nothing really to complain about here; there's nothing to get excited about either. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just bowling with no-frills whatsoever. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, this could've been a lot worse, considering that it was developed by Another (famous for the "Black Bass" video game, as well as "Hoshi o Miru Hito" - the worst R.P.G. on the FamiCom). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A couple other points of interest, while we're looking at this: "Championship Bowling" was originally an Arcade Game released by Romstar (also in 1989). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, the N.E.S. box art is taken directly from the Arcade flier, however the game itself looks nothing like the Arcade version, which used a trackball for the controls and had fancy graphics and voice samples. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The N.E.S. version must have been developed completely separately. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, as you probably remember from the title card, a few minutes ago, this game did get a release in Japan in 1991, however it was published by Athena instead of Romstar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Athena version appears to be absolutely identical except for the word 'Athena' appearing when the pin-setter comes down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, I'll point out that the design of the lady bowler makes her look like she's wearing a skirt that's way too short and black thong underwear. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So we'll now wrap up 1989 with some Tengen games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fantasy Zone 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 [?] [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega | Tengen
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tengen 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but we're gonna close off 1989 with not one, not two, not even three - but four Tengen games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I have] no idea exactly when these were released but they're all dated 1989 and all of them are ports of Arcade games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you might recall, Tengen was the product of Atari Games (not to be confused with Atari Corporation which at this point was a completely separate company that produced the Atari 7800, the Lynx, the Jaguar, etc.). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Atari Games was the former Arcade games division of Atari and thus quite a few Tengen carts are ports of Atari Arcade games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's start off with a couple which will be very familiar to viewers of the 'Chron...' series - "Fantasy Zone" and "Shinobi". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Atari Games ported a few Sega games for the N.E.S. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After all, we wouldn't expect Sega to publish games for the N.E.S., themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Fantasy Zone" (like all the other Tengen games this episode were) [was] unlicensed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Tengen had released a few licensed carts in 1988. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There was "Pac-Man", "Gauntlet", and Namco's "R.B.I. Baseball". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But they rather sneakily acquired the code for the N.E.S. lockout chip and then started releasing carts that were not licensed, which set off several years of litigation. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this was in addition to Tengen's legal battles with Nintendo over "Tetris", which we covered in some detail in Episode 45. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But back to "Fantasy Zone". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is, of course, a port of Sega's 1986 Arcade game, which is delightful and cute. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It has great music - one of Sega's best Arcade games of the period. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your little ship, 'Opa-Opa', flies around killing various creatures and stealing their money, which you can then spend on bigger and better weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's all very charming. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm [pretty] sure "Fantasy Zone" was ported to literally every video game platform that ever existed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've already seen a few versions in the "Chron..." series but the odd thing is this; this is the second port of "Fantasy Zone" for the N.E.S. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's right, in "...Episode 20" we looked at Sunsoft's port, which was released [only] in Japan in 1987. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And Tengen didn't actually just release Sunsoft's port in the U.S.; they actually made a completely different version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And honestly, I'm not sure which one is worse. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Neither are exactly beautiful. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sunsoft's has ugly colors and distractingly busy backgrounds; Tengen's comes closer to the pastel color scheme of the original but still manages to look quite ugly and flickery and in motion, it looks very jerky. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The music might also be worse. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And what is very odd is that horizontal line of garbage (separating the box at the bottom from the main part of the screen). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As far as I can tell, this isn't any sort of emulation glitch; this is actually how it plays in the original game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Overall, Tengen's "Fantasy Zone" isn't really an enjoyable experience. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose it's probably considered to be worse than Sunsoft's, but honestly, neither one of these is really great. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shinobi 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 [?] [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega | Tengen
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tengen 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, wow! Does this look familiar? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe, because we just saw it in the last episode of 'Chronturbo'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, it is, once again, "Shinobi". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are so many versions of this; I just don't know. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well... we are all familiar with Sega's 1987 arcade hit, "Shinobi". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You're a ninja, named Joe Musashi, who has to rescue some kids or something. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You're walking around, throwing your little ninja stars, and occasionally slicing someone up with your sword or using Ninja Magic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, previously in 'Chronsega', we saw the version released for the Master System, which was actually slowed down and a, uh, somewhat more strategic version of the Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was [pretty] good, I guess. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Then there was the PC Engine version by Asmik, released on December 8th. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It felt a bit more like the Arcade game, although with some missing levels and you no longer have those, uh, special melee attacks when you get up close to an enemy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And now we have the Nintendo Entertainment System version and, you know, it's not exactly great. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It feels much slower than the Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Joe just sort of strolls across the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can also [only] sh... throw one projectile at a time (which I guess was because of, uh... due to sprite limitations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The level design seems very similar to the Master System version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It feels more like a port of that game than it does the Arcade original. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, a few notable things about this version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Rescuing the kids sometimes gives you bonuses, like refilling your health meter or giving you slightly better (but still very boring) weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And sometimes it gives you just points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On the other hand, in order to obtain Ninja Magic you have to earn it by beating the bonus levels - you know the ones where all the ninjas come up and, uh, jump at you? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is, like, insanely hard! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, unlike the Arcade "Shinobi", you can't really rely on Ninja Magic to help you with the boss battles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like the Tengen "Fantasy Zone", there are these strange little graphical glitches, like those flashing pixels below your life bar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's not horrifically ugly but it looks like a very generic N.E.S. action game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You wouldn't even know that Joe is a ninja, just by looking at him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He could be some kind of, like, generic army dude, based on his character sprite. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Bottom line: this is a very eccentric port of "Shinobi" that feels like a whole different game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not exactly terrible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, today there's a million ways to play "Shinobi" at home. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So when it comes down to "Shinobi" ports, as you kids would say today, "This ain't it, Chief." 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Road Runner 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 [?] [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atari Games | Tengen
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tengen 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here's an Arcade Game port that nobody asked for: "Road Runner" a not-especially-well-remembered Arcade Game from 1985, manufactured by Atari. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it was four years old, at this point, which in the world of 1980s video games was a lifetime. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 '89 was the year "Final Fight" and "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" were in arcades and, compared to those, "Road Runner" was a very simple quarter-muncher. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the idea is quite simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You are the famously speedy Road Runner and are being chased by [Wile] E. Coyote. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is simply to not let him catch you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you can run faster than Wile E., but there are some complications. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, you can't just leave Wile E. in the dust; if you get too far ahead of him, he'll suddenly get rocket-powered roller skates and chase you around at high speed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Throughout the game, there are also various gizmos he will pick up that will give him a temporary advantage over you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first is this rocket, which zooms back and forth across the screen very fast, allowing him to suddenly grab you and carry you away. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can avoid this by standing near a vertical intersection and moving up or down when he appears at the edge of the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you reach a pre-determined point on this level, Wile E. will lose his gizmo. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the Arcade Game was actually quite a bit more attractive-looking and in 1985 it looked just amazing, what with the very fast action and parallax scrolling. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the use of some very well-known Warner Bros. cartoon characters was [pretty] novel. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There weren't really many games using licensed characters, at that time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The original series of 'Road Runner' cartoons ran from the 1950s until 1966, becoming very popular and with Road Runner [pretty] much replacing Bugs Bunny in the 1960s as Warner Bros. top-billed character. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Throughout the '70s and '80s, old Warner Bros. cartoons were packaged into Saturday morning cartoon shows, such as 'The Bugs Bunny and Road Runner Show', which ran all the way up until 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you are of a certain age, you probably have Barbara Cameron's 'Road Runner' theme song burned into your brain. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thus, a 'Road Runner' video game in 1985 made perfect sense. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, the game began life in 1984 as a LaserDisc game, which used animated intros and backgrounds. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game was never released, but a prototype does still exist. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some footage has been recorded and we can actually see the LaserDisc animation in the original version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game was scrapped and the version that was finally released in 1985 uses standard pixel art for the background. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, aesthetically speaking, the N.E.S. "Road Runner" is [pretty] compromised. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's ugly as heck and, to be honest, it's not a lot of fun to play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are six brief levels which repeat endlessly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 To play through all six levels, without dying takes about six minutes, so there's not exactly a lot of content here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game gets more difficult, as you continue to cycle through the levels, as land mines are added on to the road, and various other complications. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there are other obstacles such as moving trucks that will run over you, but these can also be used to temporarily flatten Wile E. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For some reason, the trucks in this are marked 'ACE' rather than 'ACME'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you also need to be constantly picking up birdseed to avoid losing energy and becoming too tired to run. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There were a few things that were dropped in the N.E.S. port like buckshot, that looked like birdseed, which would allow Wile E. to use a magnet on you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The trickiest thing here is probably the controls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Road Runner moves around in kind of a herky-jerky fashion and it can sometimes be [pretty] hard to grab the birdseed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the Road Runner can easily get hung up on corners in these types of areas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, while "Road Runner" is a very simple game on paper, actually playing it, you can find [yourself] battling the controls a lot. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A number of folks may have enjoyed "Road Runner" as youngsters, but I doubt you'll find much pleasure in it today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just the fact that the levels are so short and just repeat endlessly means you'll lose interest [pretty] quickly. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Sprint 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 [?] [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atari Games | Tengen
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tengen 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh boy! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's "Super Sprint" from Tengen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If nothing else, the opening music is [pretty] cool. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's simultaneously chill and also sort of funky. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Tengen has been releasing some [pretty] old-fashioned games, like "Road Runner" but "Super Sprint" is something else. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a downright archaic top-down racing game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, this thing is stripped down; it's basically just driving around the track over and over again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are four cars on the track but of course, [only] two people can play at once, so there's always gonna be two A.I. cars racing against you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is based on Atari Games' 1986 arcade title, which was notable for allowing three players at once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was a [pretty] chunky cabinet and please forgive me for being absolutely unable to control my vehicle in these videos. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Trying to play games that used analog steering wheel controls with a keyboard is not exactly an optimal setup. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now there's some cool stuff here, like the ramp that you jump, if your car crashes and explodes, a, like, little helicopter will... will fly out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the thing is, "Super Sprint" was just an updated version of one of Atari's earliest Arcade games, "Sprint 2", released in 1976. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Well, technically it was a Kee game, rather than Atari.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But yeah, so the roots of this game are just ancient. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Atari put out several variations of this game, all throughout the '70s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the thing is, the N.E.S. "Super Sprint" really isn't that different from the original "Sprint 2". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's the same basic concept - just with better graphics and a few extras thrown in, like the wrenches you can pick up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Between races you can spend them for these, uh, very basic upgrades - nothing too exciting, I'm afraid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's also some various obstacles, like these little tornados (which will cause you to lose control of your car). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 ([I] don't know why they're holding a professional car race in the middle of a tornado; that seems [pretty] dangerous to me.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The one annoying thing is that, in 1989, Atari Games released "Badlands" - a modification of "Super Sprint" with a much cooler post-apocalyptic setting. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can slow down the other vehicles by shooting at them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, among the upgrades you can select, are missiles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Atari released "Badlands" for so many platforms (DOS, the Commodore 64, the Z.X. Spectrum) but not the N.E.S. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd say this would have made a much more interesting N.E.S. game than "Super Sprint" but oh well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, once again, just like so many Tengen games, "Super Sprint" is not exactly bad, but you also can't get very excited about it either. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Toobin' 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 [?] [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atari Games | Tengen
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tengen 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, let's keep these ten games a-rollin' with "Toobin'". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Pretty] rad music on the title screen here, but I feel like this has been used before in some other game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I... I can't quite recall. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Toobin'" is (incredibly enough) the first video game based on that great American sport: floating in the water on an inner tube. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I was not aware that anybody actually called this "tubing" and I must confess this seems like a [pretty] un-exciting subject for a video game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's not really a sport, per se. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Regardless, we'll start off here on the Colorado River. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm 'Bif', apparently. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so there's a, uh, [pretty] high level of abstraction, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The green bags floating in the water are quote-unquote "treasure chests" and they give you points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Those red rectangles that you can pick up and throw are quote-unquote "cans". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The manual doesn't say what's in the cans, but typically one would drink beer while relaxing in the water on an inner tube. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Going through these gates will also give you some points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is simply to make your way down the river until you reach the end, whereupon you move on to the next river - in this case, the Okefenokee, which is a swamp, not a river (though the famous Swanee River [or, more properly, the 'Suwannee'] is fed by the Okefenokee Swamp). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as you probably have figured out, "Toobin'" began life as an Arcade game, released in 1988. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Arcade "Toobin'" was much easier on the eyes and (unlike the N.E.S. game) all the objects, such as beer cans and treasure chests were much more recognizable. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Arcade Game also had a unique control scheme; each player has four buttons - one for each limb. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you'd press one button to paddle with your right arm and another for your right leg and so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It also had a very cool motorized marquee. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Bringing up "Toobin'" on Twitter, it seemed that more people recalled the Arcade version than the home version, which makes sense because Atari Games was still a [pretty] big player in the Arcade world of the late '80s. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game just cycles you forever through a series of rivers; there are around 20 altogether. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some of them are real, like the Rio Grande or the Nile; others are fictional, like the Styx (which really doesn't sound like a very fun place to go inner tubing in). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are shortcuts; this whirlpool near the beginning of the Colorado will take you to the warp zone, where you can find shortcuts to other rivers (such as the Nevada, in this case). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you progress through the various rivers, more and more hazards will appear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eh... For example, hunters will stand on the banks and shoot at you (they don't like tubers in their hunting grounds, I assume), in the Amazon, uh, Indians will use blow-guns at you, and so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some levels are quite fanciful, like this futuristic level where you have to avoid robots, toxic waste spills, and violent punk rockers. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Toobin'" is definitely less irritating than "Road Runner" and there's a bit more content simply because there are more levels but, once again, the N.E.S. port lacks the character of the Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The incredibly ugly graphics simply don't capture any of the original's charm. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's not exactly pointless, but "Toobin'" just does not translate well as an N.E.S. game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ganbare Goemon Gaiden: Kieta Ougon Kiseru 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 January 05 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our first game of 1990 is... an R.P.G. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 How appropriate. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Ganbare Goemon Gaiden: Kieta Ougon Kiseru" is the third game in Konami's wacky "Ganbare Goemon" series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first two were action games but this one is (well, like I said just a minute ago, it's) an R.P.G.! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first 'Ganbare Goemon' game to be released in the U.S. was the Super Nintendo game called "Legend of the Mystical Ninja". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 None of the FamiCom games got any sort of release outside of Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, once again, we have a [pretty] good translation. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This sets up the tone of the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's probably a bit sillier than the first two games and later games would continue to move in this direction, with all kinds of goofy elements and anachronisms. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The story here doesn't involve evil forces threatening the world or anything. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All that happens is that Goemon's pipe is missing, so he goes out to find it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 His sidekick, the ninja Ebisumaru, joins him, for no apparent reason. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game does [pretty] much use the standard J.R.P.G. rulebook, so it's not really that much different than "Glory of Hercules II"; it's just a bit more clever and creative. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, we all know exactly where this is going. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He'll walk around town, talk to people, find some invisible money hidden in a corner, stop by the shops and buy the cheapest weapons and armor, then head out and fight random encounters (you know - the usual business). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, we have your typical helmets, gauntlets, and armor available. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Overall, this game seems a bit easier than most J.R.P.G.s, 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I got unlucky, almost immediately after leaving town and Goemon was killed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, unfortunately, I couldn't find any way to revive him in the first village, so I had to restart. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Near the starting village, we'll find a castle, which serves as the first dungeon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I mentioned that this game feels easier than most J.R.P.G.s of the time and we can see what I mean, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Walking around in the castle, the encounter rate is pleasingly low. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies are [pretty] straightforward and don't use any annoying status effects at this point, so you won't get poisoned every other battle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first boss is actually a cakewalk! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's an official of some sort who you need to beat up in order for him to give you a pass so that you can get through a nearby checkpoint. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, once you have the pass you can show it to the guards and you'll move on to the next area. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] don't know why Goemon can't just beat up the guards instead of having to find the pass. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, many of the enemies you encounter in this are just regular-looking human beings and Goemon has absolutely no qualms about killing them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, you make your way through the world on the trail of the guy who has your pipe. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You do the usual stuff - rest at inns, buy better equipment, solve some problems for the townspeople (for example, in this town the canals have all dried up). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The enemies tend to be based on traditional Japanese things and monsters (such as, like, in this case, a lantern) there's also demons and various folk creatures, sumo wrestlers; you get the idea. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, like I was saying, this game feels [pretty] easy - even the boss battles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just attacking this guy with regular attacks, he'll go down [pretty] quickly; I barely took any damage! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll then get the aqua orb, which will restore the town's water and also, apparently, cause a lock-pick to float up to the top of this well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The lock-pick is super helpful, in general, but is specifically needed to unlock this door in an underground passage, which allows you to cross this river. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'Goemon' games like throwing in anachronistic elements and technology so here, for example, uh... you travel to the next area in a train that appears to be foot-powered. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, despite being an absolutely by-the-numbers R.P.G., in terms of mechanics and overall design, it throws in enough silly elements and loopy surprises to keep the player entertained. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, you reach a village entirely populated by cats, who all make a little 'meow' sound effect when they speak. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, you'll get drugged and imprisoned by one of the cats. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, you can escape with a fellow prisoner (and third party member) by using the lock-pick. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you'll fight off the bad cat. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a robot theme going on, throughout the game, like this giant robot which passes by or this adventurer's laboratory, which is full of robots. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's also a naughty scene where Goemon watches a strip show. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it turns out there are various robot impostors running around, including one of Goemon, which causes this misunderstanding with this ninja girl who, uh, fights you and easily defeats you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You then need to battle the impostor robot-Goemon, then the ninja girl becomes your fourth and final party member. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll eventually get your pipe back and, uh, the final bosses are giant robots. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So it's a [pretty] simple R.P.G. which has a surplus of charm. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Is this worth playing? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, yeah, maybe. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it has a very different tone than most R.P.G.s so you might find it somewhat entertaining. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's definitely a little different. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Adventures of Lolo 🇯🇵 // The Adventures of Lolo 2 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 January 06 🇯🇵 // 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL Laboratory 🇯🇵 // HAL America 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Man! That is some opening! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so let's keep going with January. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 January 6th "Adventures of Lolo". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the third (fourth maybe?) 'Eggerland' game that we've seen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, so it's this B.S. again - pushing around little blocks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As a reminder, the 'Eggerland' games were a series of puzzle games from HAL Laboratory that began life on the M.S.X. then moved to the FamiCom and F.D.S. and finally got a release in the U.S. under the name, the "Adventures of Lolo". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This U.S. game was just a compilation of various levels from the earlier Japanese games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, HAL must have realized that 'Adventures of Lolo' was a much more appealing name than 'Eggerland', so they decided to borrow it for this - the newest Japanese entry in the series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then, two months later, this was released in the U.S., but since HAL had already used the name "Adventures of Lolo" for the first U.S. game, they gave this one the title, "Adventures of Lolo 2". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, but here's the thing - they changed a lot of levels for the U.S. version! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Both versions have 50 levels but some (not all of them) are different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Adventures of Lolo" and "Adventures of Lolo 2" are the same game, except that they're not. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now (probably assuming that U.S. gamers were not, like, the hardened 'Eggerland' players that Japanese gamers were) "Adventures of Lolo 2" starts you off nice and gentle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As a reminder: the 'Eggerland' games are a series of puzzle games, comprising a series of single-screen rooms, which you need to escape from. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is done by collecting all the hearts in each room, in order to unlock the exit door. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The rooms are filled with enemies; some, like these little green slugs, are harmless, but they do block your way. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are many enemy types and some are considerably more dangerous than others. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some levels give you a weapon that turns enemies into eggs that can be pushed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In other levels, you'll need to rely solely on p... pushing blocks around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, you need to be a genius to figure this one out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Japanese puzzle games love this particular unintuitive block-pushing puzzle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It appears in 'Sokoban' games and was even used in a 'Dragon Quest' game, once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hmm... No; that's not right. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's very easy to make a mistake which can't be undone. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can [only] push blocks, not pull them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If this happens, you'll need to hit the suicide button, which takes away one life but resets the level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so here's the correct solution. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For the most part, the game revolves around pushing blocks in order to access the hearts and also protect yourself from monsters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, these gray 'Chia Pet'-looking things will shoot spikes in all four cardinal directions, resulting in instant death if you step on the same column or row as them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So in order to get past them you'll need to push blocks in order to block their attack. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Clearly, each room is just a matrix of tiles; each of which is either empty or occupied by an enemy, a block, or other objects. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But when pushing blocks, they don't really quite snap into place. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's very easy to accidentally push them just a little too far - for example, this block here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I pushed it just a wee bit too far and now I can't move it to the left. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For me, at least, pushing blocks, just a smidgen too far was [pretty] much the main reason I'd have to start the level over again and I found this to be very frustrating. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so one last game and we're done with January. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This month has been a piece of cake, so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Igo Meikan 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 January 10 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hector
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Aoki Shoten Publishing 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's finish off with a game that none of you either know or care about. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Igo Meikan" is sort of an educational game, which helps you learn to play "Igo" - the game that we usually call "Go" in the West. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are multiple modes to choose from in the menu. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This one, for example, just runs through hypothetical "Go" games and shows you the correct moves to make, in response to your opponent's moves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Other more interactive modes have you try to choose the correct move. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So the computer will put down a piece and you will need to choose the correct play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you choose incorrectly the game will show you the correct choice. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Another mode will make it a bit easier by showing you several possible choices - and you need to select which one is correct. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there's a couple unusual things about this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Smaller publishers sometimes had unusual packaging and "Igo Meikan" came in sort of a clamshell-style box, as seen here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, while the game was developed by Hector, it was published by Aoki Shoten - a book publisher. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aoki Shoten started life as a bookstore, run by one Haruo Aoki, and later started publishing books - often on subjects such as Marxism and philosophy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As far as I can tell, they are still around today and, to my knowledge, this is Aoki Shoten's [only] venture into video games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, sorry; it's not a very exciting way to end an episode on, but I've got to play by the rules. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 54 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, that wraps it up for the entire damn year of 1989. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... Best game this episode? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hell! I don't know. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Batman"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's probably what you kids would choose, right - the 'Batman' game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sure! Why not? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Worst? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... I'm going to say "Shinobi". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just that in 2020 this is so unnecessary. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's the worst console port of "Shinobi" that we've seen; having to earn your Ninja Magic through the bonus levels really sucks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I just don't think there's really any reason to play this, at this point in time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next up will be the new 'Video Nasties' episode - Part 1 of our examination of the career of Herschel Gordon Lewis, where we do a deep dive into his 1963... (well I can't call it a 'masterpiece' or a 'tour de force' - we'll just say his 1963) strip of celluloid, "Blood Feast". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Following this up will be "Chrontendo Episode 55", which (despite [only] being 10 games long) will still have two huge blockbuster titles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So there's something to look forward to. 🍇🍌
