👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 13 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Thank you for tuning in to 🍋 "Chrontendo Episode 13". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And we're gonna pick up right 🍋 where we left off last time: 🍊 in the middle of the 🍋 Japanese holiday season 🍊 which is a busy busy time 🍋 for video game manufacturers. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, something we're 🍋 going to see this episode 🍊 (that we haven't seen too 🍋 much of, for the FamiCom), 🍊 is a Sports Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There is a Baseball Game 🍋 coming up 🍊 and it's [only] actually 🍊 the second Baseball Game 🍋 released for the system 🍊 (the first being 🍋 Nintendo's "Baseball" 🍊 [which] came out 🍋 way-back-when). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo had released 🍋 a few Sports Games 🍊 ("Tennis", "Soccer", 🍋 "Golf", "Baseball") 🍊 and more recently 🍋 they released "Volleyball". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 IREM released a Football Game 🍋 but, other than that, 🍊 there haven't really been many 🍋 Sports titles for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, starting about right now, 🍋 we're gonna see a sudden pickup 🍊 in the number of 🍋 Sports Games coming out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, over the next couple 🍋 years for the FamiCom, 🍊 brace yourself for an unusually 🍋 large number of Golf Games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gall Force - Eternal Story 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 10 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL Laboratory 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, there's something 🍋 different, right there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is 🍋 "Gall Force: Eternal Story". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is, uh, based on 🍋 the 1986 animated feature film 🍊 - the first in a series 🍋 of several movies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 The plot was concerning a race 🍋 of all-female 'Solnoids' 🍊 battling an evil alien race, 🍋 called the 'Paranoids'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Sounds like this was written by 🍋 L. Ron Hubbard or something.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is the first game 🍋 to be published by HAL. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They had previously 🍋 developed some titles, uh, 🍊 but this is their 🍋 first game as a publisher. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They'd later go on 🍋 to fame and to fortune 🍊 with such games as the 'Kirby' 🍋 series and "Super Smash Bros.". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And here you'll see a [pretty] 🍋 elaborate introduction sequence, here, 🍊 that shows you all the characters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is disturbing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That character's supposed 🍋 to be [only] ten years old. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess we've just seen 🍊 the introduction of lolicon 🍋 into console video games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Video game culture definitely 🍋 takes a turn for the worse, 🍋 right here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thanks a lot, HAL. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, definitely, "Gall Force..." 🍊 has some [pretty] nice 🍋 production values. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once the game itself 🍋 actually loads, 🍊 you'll see that you're 🍋 playing a... 🍊 [pretty] much a standard-looking 🍋 Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [only] have one fire button 🍋 (that'll hit things 🍊 that are both in the air 🍋 and things on the ground). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And in this game you have some 🍋 sort of invisible life bar; 🍊 you can take a number 🍋 of hits before dying. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, actually, 🍋 the first thing that'll happen 🍊 is one of your, uh, 🍋 engines will come off, 🍊 then the second one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then, finally, uh, 🍋 once you're just to the... 🍊 the main body 🍋 you'll then, uh, lose a life. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, once you've gotten through 🍋 the first part of the level, here, 🍊 you'll eventually come to these 🍋 little tubes that look, I guess... 🍊 some sort of warp thing that'll 🍋 launch you into outer space. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You select one of these, depending 🍋 on which level you wanna go to, 🍊 it'll actually repair your ship, 🍊 and then, uh, shoot you off into 🍋 some sort of a space station. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, up to this point, "Gall Force..." 🍋 seemed like a [pretty] decent Shooter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's really around, uh, 🍋 this level right here 🍊 where things start to break down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you notice, 🍋 the graphics look [pretty] good 🍊 and the environments are 🍋 actually very detailed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's really to HAL's credit 🍊 they were actually able to put 🍋 this much stuff on-screen at once 🍊 without having 🍋 massive amounts of flicker. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But the problem here is that 🍊 there really are a lot of enemies 🍋 and a lot of bullets. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, 🍋 you can barely see the bullets 🍋 against the very busy background. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's simply too much 🍋 stuff going on here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This level might be okay if there 🍋 was a plain black background, 🍊 but as it is you really 🍋 can't see what's going on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There're just tons of 🍋 cannons on the ground, 🍊 firing a constant barrage 🍋 of shots at you, 🍊 enemy fighters come in 🍋 from all directions, 🍊 and it's really... 🍊 you're gonna get hit 🍋 a lot of times, 🍊 simply because it's very difficult 🍋 to concentrate on what's going on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the fact that the enemy ships 🍋 move a lot faster than you 🍊 (your ship is very very slow) 🍋 doesn't make this game any easier. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, once you get 🍋 to the actual boss, 🍊 you'll probably be 🍋 a little disappointed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy looks [pretty] good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's, uh, certainly decent sized, 🍊 even if he's a little silly-looking 🍋 with those weird eyeball-like things. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, he does sort of fire 🍋 the same sort of group of shots 🍊 over and over again 🍋 in a [pretty] simple pattern. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's very easy to dodge, but he 🍋 takes a lot of hits to blow up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I've actually edited out the 🍋 vast majority of this boss fight, 🍊 but actually doing this 🍋 is incredibly tedious. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [You've] simply got to dodge, 🍋 get a few shots in, 🍊 and then repeat over and over again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This boss fight is really 🍊 more of an endurance match 🍋 than an actual challenge. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've blown this guy up, 🍋 another character will join your team. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you have multiple team members, 🍋 you can actually switch between them 🍊 but this doesn't 🍋 actually change your ship 🍊 and there doesn't really 🍋 seem to be much point to it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, that you've completed Level 1, 🍋 you'll move on to the next level, 🍊 fly over the planet's surface again, 🍋 then go back into outer space, 🍊 and then you'll face 🍋 another long dull boss fight. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, really, one of the 🍋 major failings of this game 🍊 is that there doesn't seem to be 🍋 much in the way of power-ups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each character has 🍋 some sort of special ability. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, for example, 🍋 the one character, 🍊 you can get a little 🍋 helper ship that comes in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But these really 🍋 aren't very useful. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, the helper ship 🍋 disappears quite quickly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe later characters 🍋 are much better, but, uh, 🍊 it seems that 🍋 for most of the game 🍊 you'll be playing with just 🍋 your regular laser cannon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe if you had 🍋 better power-ups, 🍊 this game might be 🍋 a bit more playable, 🍊 but as a rule, you're 🍋 completely underpowered, 🍊 way too slow, and completely 🍋 bombarded by enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Especially on the 🍋 space station levels, 🍊 I found [myself] 🍋 getting hit tons of times. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Zanac" certainly proved 🍊 that a Shooter could put 🍋 lots of enemies on the screen 🍊 and be very challenging but 🍋 still be fun at the same time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is not nearly as 🍋 well-balanced as "Zanac". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's quite possible there are 🍋 some aspects of this game 🍊 that I simply failed to grasp. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, to me, this game 🍋 certainly appears to be 🍊 a technically very well done, 🍋 but almost entirely unplayable 🍋 Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 HAL Laboratories would, of course, 🍊 go on to make better games 🍋 in the future. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Takeshi no Chousenjou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 10 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We certainly have some 🍋 very odd games this episode, 🍊 but nothing nearly as weird as 🍊 Namco's "Takeshi no Chōsenjō" 🍋 (or 'Takeshi's Challenge'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Who is Takeshi? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, he's none other than 🍋 Takeshi Beat Kitano, 🍊 the Japanese comedian 🍋 and T.V. personality, 🍊 who was quite well-known 🍋 in Japan in the mid-'80s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He had several T.V. shows, 🍊 including the rather bizarre 🍋 game show, 'Takeshi's Castle'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He didn't really break through 🍋 in the West until the '90s 🍊 where he's more known as, 🍋 not as a comedian, 🍊 but as a serious actor 🍋 and director of 🍊 gritty stylized crime dramas 🍋 like "Violent Cop" and "Sonatine". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I like that chart we just saw 🍋 in the background, there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess things 🍋 aren't going too well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Takeshi no Chōsenjō" is really 🍋 unlike any game ever made 🍊 and was deliberately designed 🍋 to be unplayable 🍊 - probably as some sort of a 🍋 statement about video games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In Japan, this is considered 🍋 to be a prime example of 'kusoge' 🍊 (or 'a shitty game') 🍊 but it actually has 🍋 sort of a cult following 🍊 due to its almost 🍋 avant-garde nature. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the game you play a typical 🍋 Japanese white collar worker 🍊 who leaves his job and goes off 🍊 in search of some sort of hidden 🍋 treasure in an exotic locale. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game begins with you simply 🍋 wandering around on the streets 🍊 and you can beat up 🍋 anybody that you want to. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If nothing else, the game has 🍊 a rather entertaining 🍋 jumping animation 🍊 and amusing little graphics of you 🍋 pounding the other guys into mush. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, in order to actually 🍋 make any progress in the game, 🍊 you'll need to into this one bar 🍊 and sing this karaoke song 🍋 repeatedly for one hour. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Remember that the FamiCom controller 🍋 has a microphone built into it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you actually manage 🍋 to get through this, 🍊 you'll apparently be required 🍋 to hold down a button 🍊 while the screen goes blank 🍋 for around four hours. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's unlikely many folks will be 🍋 able to make it through this 🍊 but if you do, 🍋 apparently what happens is 🍊 you fly off to some remote island, 🍊 experience a very bad 🍋 horizontal flying level, 🍊 do some platformings 🍋 through the island native villages, 🍊 and eventually enter a temple 🍋 to face the final boss. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Reportedly, you have to 🍋 defeat this boss by 🍊 hitting a button on your 🍋 controller 20,000 times in a row. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After that, the game ends. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, if you, yourself, play 🍊 you'll probably spend all your time 🍋 simply wandering around the streets 🍊 beating up the little Yakuza guys. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [only] people who 🍋 actually attack you or the... 🍊 (well, I assume they're Yakuza) 🍊 ...the green haired guys 🍋 are occasionally the cops. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At one point, you can 🍋 enter a 'Pachinko' parlor 🍊 and play a really silly 🍋 little 'Pachinko' minigame. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But I certainly wouldn't 🍋 advise you play the game 🍊 with the intent to get through it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, technically this game 🍋 looks [pretty] wretched. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Certainly the graphics aren't 🍋 very appealing looking. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And all the fighting 🍋 is very boring. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You simply, uh, battle someone 🍊 by hitting your button 🍋 and striking him 🍊 over and over and over again 🍋 while he does the same to you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While, in theory, this game was 🍋 designed by Beat Kitano, himself, 🍊 I'm not really sure who 🍋 actually developed this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This does seem sort of below the 🍋 standards of Namco's usual work. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, there's a [pretty] 🍋 notorious glitch in the game 🍊 where you can enter one level where 🍋 everything is completely screwed up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, of course, 🍋 I suppose it's possible 🍊 this could have 🍋 been done on purpose. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, what do we think 🍋 about this game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I don't know. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's really more of an experiment 🍋 than a real game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess it's [a] interesting idea, 🍊 but not the kind of thing you 🍋 actually wannna sit down and play. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium 🇯🇵 // R.B.I. Baseball 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 10 🇯🇵 // 1988 [?] [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // Tengen 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 From Taito's long-standing 🍋 competitor, Namco, 🍊 we have a game that is about as 🍋 different from "Takeshi no Chōsenjō" 🍊 as a game can be: 🍋 "Pro Yakyuu "Family Stadium". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Yakyuu" is "Baseball" 🍊 and this is [only] the second 🍋 Baseball Game for the FamiCom 🍊 after Nintendo's own 🍋 early title, "Baseball". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, "Pro Yakyuu..." 🍊 is significantly different 🍋 from the earlier Baseball Games 🍊 in that it uses 🍋 real life players. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The teams are clearly based on 🍋 actual Japanese baseball teams 🍊 such as the Yomiuri Giants, 🍋 the Yokohama BayStars, 🍊 and the Hanshin Tigers 🍊 and features such well-known 🍋 players as Sadaharu Oh. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is actually the first game 🍋 in Namco's 'Family Stadium' series 🍊 (or the 'FamiSta' series, 🍋 as it's often called in Japan). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Namco is still releasing 🍋 'FamiSta' games, to this very day. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So you choose your team, 🍋 pick your starting pitcher, 🍊 and begin the game! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Family Stadium" plays much like 🍋 the earlier Nintendo game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You move your, uh, player around 🍋 and swing the bat. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like real 'Baseball', 🍊 hitting the ball with 🍋 the bat's sweet spot 🍊 tends to yield better results. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I, myself, though, tend to get 🍋 a lot of fouls and pop flys... 🍊 and occasionally you'll get lucky 🍋 and get a home run. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, once your player has, uh, 🍋 hit the ball, 🍊 you can use your D-Pad and buttons 🍋 to control your runner: 🍊 whether you want him 🍊 to advance to a base, go back, 🍋 so on [and] so forth. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the huge gameplay advance 🍋 in "Family Stadium" is that 🍊 every player has his own individual 🍋 stats for hitting and pitching. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thus, every team is different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some players are power hitters and 🍋 are more likely to hit home runs; 🍊 some pitchers can throw 🍋 faster than others. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Knowing your team's capabilities 🍋 is essential to mastering the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Family Baseball" has 🍋 a certain strategic element 🍊 that a lot of 🍋 earlier Baseball Games 🍊 (like the Nintendo title) 🍋 were missing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing that's 🍊 a little annoying and difficult 🍋 about this game is fielding. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I, myself, 🍋 find it [pretty] hard to determine 🍋 where the ball is gonna land. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can't actually see it [while] 🍋 it's up [in] the air, 🍊 so you sort of have to guess 🍋 where to put your guy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If "Family Stadium" 🍋 looks familiar to you, 🍊 it's because it was 🍋 released in the U.S. by Tengen 🍋 as "R.B.I. Baseball". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of Namco's games were 🍋 actually released by Tengen 🍊 (and Tengen, of course, 🍊 was the sub-division of Atari 🍋 that released N.E.S. titles). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "R.B.I. Baseball" used 🍋 American teams and players 🍊 and was released 🍋 sometime in early 1988 🍊 and the actual team names 🍋 could not be used, um, 🍊 but since Tengen had 🍋 the M.L.B.P.A. license, 🍊 the actual players' 🍋 names could be used, 🍊 just like in the 🍋 Japanese version, 🍊 and the stats were based on 🍋 the real players' stats. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As it turns out, 🍊 "R.B.I. Baseball" became one 🍋 of the most highly-thought-of 🍋 Sports Games for the N.E.S. 🍊 and still has a [pretty] big 🍋 following to this day. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing that was changed, 🍋 obviously, was the teams' colors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, that guy's 🍋 a [pretty] fast pitcher. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, at least he's 🍋 [pretty] good at striking me out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, once again, I get another foul. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, regardless of, uh, qualities, 🍋 uh, "R.B.I. Baseball" has, 🍊 as a game, it did mark a 🍋 [pretty] major turning point 🍋 in Sports Games - 🍊 away from games featuring 🍋 generic teams and players 🍊 and more towards games 🍊 based on actual sports 🍋 leagues and real players. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Today, of course, a lot of 🍋 the popular Sports franchises 🍊 are all [pretty] much, you know, 🍋 licensed by the N.F.L. 🍊 or, uh, Major League Baseball, 🍋 and so on [and] so forth. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Back at this time, that 🍋 really was [pretty] uncommon, 🍊 which is sort of what made 🍋 "R.B.I. Baseball" so much different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For better or worse, 🍋 "Family Stadium" // "R.B.I. Baseball" 🍊 was one of the games that started 🍋 the trend in complexity and stats 🍊 and so-called realism 🍋 in Sports Games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sherlock Holmes: Hakushaku Reijou Yuukai Jiken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 11 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Towa Chiki
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Towa Chiki 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here we come to "Sherlock Holmes: 🍋 Hakushaku Reijō Yūkai Jiken". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a very strange little game 🍋 that is almost unknown today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The subtitle 🍋 translates roughly into 🍊 'The Kidnapping of 🍋 the Count's Daughter' 🍊 which is exactly what we saw 🍋 occurring during the title screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game involves the 🍋 disappearance of Margaret, 🍊 daughter of a British count. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You, Sherlock Holmes, 🍊 (dressed in your traditional 🍋 lime-green overcoat and deerstalker hat) 🍊 must find her. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, being the world's 🍋 greatest detective, 🍊 you'd think that you would 🍊 use your sleuthing skills 🍋 to find the missing woman, 🍊 but no! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Instead you hit the streets, 🍋 'Grand Theft Auto'-style: 🍊 killing random pedestrians 🍋 with your Kung Fu kick 🍊 and stealing their cash. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The main overworld has a 🍋 "Ganbare Goemon"-like ¾ view of town, 🍊 but you can enter various 🍋 buildings, parks, and sewer systems. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once inside, you'll switch 🍋 to the traditional side view. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly, the next game 🍋 we're gonna see, "Doreaman", 🍊 uses a very similar system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Another odd thing: 🍊 once you're inside, 🍋 Holmes' wardrobe 🍊 inexplicably changes 🍋 from green to purple. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One rather annoying thing 🍋 about this game: 🍊 whenever you hit someone 🍋 inside of a building 🍊 they'll, uh, say something. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll need to hit 🍋 both your A and your B button 🍊 to close this screen 🍋 [and] return back 🍋 to the normal game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've found 🍋 the magnifying glass, 🍊 you'll need to 🍋 search around for clues. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Right now I was examining 🍋 a crack in the wall 🍊 and it gave me a little clue. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, like "...Zelda", most of these 🍋 clues aren't particularly helpful. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I mentioned a certain 🍋 similarity to "Ganbare Goemon" 🍊 but the game world is 🍋 much smaller in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] think there's [only] - 🍋 what, maybe six or seven cities? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, each one is 🍋 relatively small, having maybe... 🍊 oh six or seven areas 🍋 that you can go into. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the areas are not exactly huge. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 The parks and the sewers are usually 🍋 not more than a few screens each. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you got - get low on health 🍋 you can go visit Watson here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He'll refill your health for free. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Otherwise, you have to go into a 🍋 shop and buy a health refill item. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I actually have it 🍋 there in my inventory. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's the green bottle 🍋 with the blue liquid. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll need a lot of money 🍋 in this game, uh, 🍊 mostly because the travel tickets 🍋 for the train are so expensive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have a maximum of, 🍋 I think it is $999 🍊 you can carry in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some of the train tickets 🍋 cost almost that, each way, 🍊 so you'll often go to a city, 🍋 do what you need to do, 🍊 and then go around 🍋 killing some more people 🍊 and get some more money. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At every city, 🍊 there's often a little criminal 🍋 headquarters you can visit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll need to put in 🍋 the correct password, 🍊 otherwise they'll steal 🍋 some of your money, uh, 🍊 you'll lose a lot of health, 🍊 and you get kicked 🍋 back out onto the street. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another thing you'll 🍋 find in cities is shops, 🍊 where you can buy 🍋 various important items 🍊 such as weapons, keys, 🍋 lamps for lighting up dark rooms, 🍊 that sort of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This shop also sells tobacco. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, the, uh, health 🍋 refills are quite expensive. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And really, you'll spend 🍋 a good chunk of this game 🍊 simply walking around 🍋 killing pedestrians. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly enough, unlike in 🍋 "Grand Theft Auto", 🍊 the police don't 🍋 really seem to mind. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This knife here is 🍋 not very useful for pedestrians. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍋 Your kick is much more powerful, 🍊 but even better is when you 🍋 can eventually get a gun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you have that, 🍊 you'll be able to clear 🍋 through pedestrians quite quickly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there're also these various bad guys 🍋 that pop up in the sewers and whatnot. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One rather amusing thing 🍋 about this game 🍊 is it certainly depicts British cities 🍋 of the time as being very dangerous. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here in Edinburgh, people walk around 🍋 the streets randomly firing off guns. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another thing: 🍋 This game is actually [pretty] hard. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have very little Life and can 🍋 take maybe two shots before dying. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Inside buildings, in particular, 🍋 it's very easy to get hit, 🍊 considering enemies are 🍋 running around very quickly 🍊 and firing guns all over the place 🍋 and you can't really duck. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One more unusual feature is 🍋 you can gamble in this game - 🍊 something else ripped off 🍋 directly from "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later, it seems gambling would 🍋 become [pretty] common in R.P.G.s, 🍊 but it really wasn't 🍋 frequently seen at this time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And once you've gotten through 🍋 all the various mini-bosses here, 🍊 you'll end up in this, uh, castle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is actually a rather 🍋 large maze-like castle, 🍊 filled with the usual henchmen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you find the hidden door that 🍋 allows you access to the final boss, 🍊 you'll be able to, uh, 🍋 pick him off in a few shots. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's actually [pretty] easy, 🍋 as long as you don't let him hit you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you can fire off shome... some 🍋 shots 'fore he rushes at you, 🍊 you'll be able to 🍋 kill him very quickly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Otherwise, he'll, uh, 🍋 kill you instantly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like a lot of the 🍋 games at this time... 🍊 (the developers of "Sherlock Holmes...", 🍋 whoever they might be... 🍊 this game was 🍋 published by Towa Chiki 🍊 - not a very well-known 🍋 Japanese publisher) 🍊 ...I don't know who 🍋 actually developed the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Towa Chiki was later known 🍋 for the, uh, 🍊 'Garfield' game for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, for some reason, 🍋 they felt the need to hide, uh, 🍊 almost all the 🍋 important items in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah, here's the 🍋 final boss right here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's try that again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, he takes [only] 🍋 a few shots to go down. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess he's saying 🍋 that he never gives up - 🍊 not that he's encouraging 🍋 you to not give up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned, "Sherlock Holmes..." 🍋 is sort of an odd little game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In some ways, 🍋 it's ahead of its time - 🍊 the way you can travel 🍋 around from city to city 🍊 in a non-linear fashion, 🍊 and had to pay money 🍋 for the privilege, 🍊 the use of gambling. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In a lot of ways, however, 🍊 it's a [pretty] much 🍋 unplayable relic of its era. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character handles very badly 🍊 and the aspect of running around 🍋 looking for various clues hidden in... 🍊 hidden in random spots [is] 🍋 certainly not very appealing. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Doreamon 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 12 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh boy! 🍋 From Hudson Soft, it's "Doreaman"! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is based on 🍊 the enormously popular Japanese 🍋 manga and T.V. series, 🍊 which is about a robotic cat 🍋 that travels back in time 🍊 in order to help 🍋 a little Japanese boy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So Doreaman is very much 🍋 like the Terminator, 🍊 [only], instead of 🍋 trying to kill the kid, 🍊 he's trying to be nice to him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'Doreaman' cartoon T.V. show 🍋 started in the late '70s, I think, 🍊 and ran for years 🍋 and years and years. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was certainly still on 🍋 when this video game came out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, there was 🍋 massive amounts of licensed 🍊 'Doreaman' junk as well, 🍋 including this game 🍊 (which really isn't 🍋 that hot for a Hudson game). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So you're dropped off 🍋 in the city, here, 🍊 and the first thing that 🍋 you do is find a weapon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That thing I just grabbed there 🍋 was actually a health refill. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah, the first thing you get 🍋 looks kinda like a glue gun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But at least it allows you 🍋 to shoot your enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This first part of the game 🍋 is vaguely "...Zelda"-like. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You wander around 🍋 in a top-down view, 🍊 occasionally dropping into tunnels 🍋 and finding little doors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll need to find various items, 🍋 such as, uh, weapons, power-ups, 🍊 things that will refill your life, 🍋 and so on and so forth. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, your first 🍋 weapon, here, is very weak, 🍊 so, right away, we 🍋 can find a power-up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, apparently this era 🍋 was sort of the golden age 🍊 of video games where 🍊 [pretty] much every single 🍋 thing in the game is hidden. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's right, 🍊 almost every single item you need 🍋 to find is hi... find is hidden 🍊 in some sort of secret manhole 🍋 or secret door or something, 🍊 so you have to go around 🍊 randomly shooting things, 🍋 in order to find them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, for example, 🍋 not [only] is the manhole hidden, 🍊 but once you get inside, 🍋 so is the power-up, itself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While this concept of 🍋 having everything hidden 🍊 was obviously taken from 🍋 "...Zelda" and similar games, 🍊 I really think its over-reliance 🍋 is a sign of, sort of, like, 🍋 lazy game designers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They can really stretch out 🍋 the length of the game, 🍊 simply by making it virtually 🍋 impossible to find anything. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I just found the, uh, 🍋 candy there, 🍊 which is, uh, 🍋 something you need to collect 🍊 to actually, uh, 🍋 pass through this level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, in the first part 🍋 of this, uh, game, here, 🍊 you sort of run around, 🍋 shoot enemies, 🍊 try to find various power-ups, 🍋 try to find the candy, 🍊 and eventually you'll, uh, 🍋 find the secret exit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this first world, here, 🍋 is not incredibly large. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, compared to "...Zelda", 🍋 the overworld is much smaller 🍊 and there's [only] a few manhole 🍋 covers and whatnot to go into. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah, here you found the very 🍋 unusual underground graveyard. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, we're actually coming 🍋 up to the first boss, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The gameplay in "Doreaman" 🍋 is actually [pretty] simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Mostly just run around 🍋 and shoot things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You don't really have, uh, 🍊 any sort of ducking ability 🍋 or anything like that 🍊 and your jumping 🍋 is [pretty] limited, 🍊 so it can, sometimes, be 🍋 difficult to avoid getting shot. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, here's the first boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We just need to avoid 🍋 his little projectiles there 🍊 and occasionally jump up 🍋 and shoot him a few times 🍊 and he'll be taken care of. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, really, the first part 🍋 of this game isn't that bad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [only] in the second part that 🍋 it starts getting [pretty] horrible; 🍊 I believe there are 🍋 three parts altogether. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've taken care of him, 🍊 you'll then move on 🍋 to the next level, 🍊 which is actually a really really 🍋 terrible Shoot-'em-Up level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's odd because Hudson 🍋 had made good Shoot-'em-Ups, 🍊 such as "Star Soldier" in the past 🍋 and would make, obviously, 🍊 very good ones in the future, 🍋 but, uh, this is really awful! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, quite frankly, 🍊 you really, sort of, wanna 🍋 try to rush through these levels 🍊 because you hate 🍋 playing them so much. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are a few minimal 🍋 power-ups you can get, 🍊 like you can get 🍋 one of the, uh, kids to, 🍊 uh, sort of, 🍋 act as your wingman, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But really, this part of 🍋 the game is very unpleasant. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 So, I can't really recommend 🍋 "Doreaman" as a good game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Its, uh, first part's not so bad; 🍋 it gets worse from there, 🍊 and, uh, it really is 🍋 sort of below the level 🍊 of qua... work that Hudson 🍋 was normally turning out. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Adian no Tsue 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 12 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ASK Kodansha? | Asmik?
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the category of games you 🍋 almost certainly won't like, 🍊 it's "Adian no Tsue" 🍊 (which means 'Cane of Adian' 🍋 or maybe 'Staff of Adian'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Right away, on the title screen, 🍊 notice the copyright notice 🍋 from Ask Kodansha. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll discuss that a little later. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But when you open up this game, 🍋 probably the first thing you'll notice 🍊 is that it is a shockingly 🍋 blatant rip off of "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You run around killing monsters, 🍋 but there's one major difference: 🍊 this is a math game! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In order to collect the bells, 🍊 you need to solve a very 🍋 simple arithmetic problem. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you get the answer wrong, 🍊 it will close the door 🍋 and send some monsters in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you get the right answer, 🍊 you'll be able to 🍋 collect the bell, 🍊 which can be used to buy 🍋 things later in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Kodansha is a huge publisher 🍊 of, uh, Japanese books, 🍋 magazines, and manga. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I believe they're actually the 🍋 largest publishing house in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not sure what they really 🍋 have to do with this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't think it's based 🍋 off an existing manga 🍊 and I can't really imagine 🍋 Kodansha developing this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably they 🍋 co-published it with Sunsoft. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, this game is subtitled 🍋 'Chinou Series One'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll see a couple of other games 🍋 in this series in future episodes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Getting the right answer 🍋 makes you very happy, by the way. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike "...Zelda", 🍋 there is no overworld - 🍊 [only] these very 🍋 small outdoors areas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Mostly, however, you're simply 🍋 roaming around the rooms 🍊 looking for the stairway 🍋 to the next level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you get all the way 🍋 up to the top, 🍊 you'll presumably 🍋 face some kind of boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I have no idea; I certainly didn't 🍋 play the game all the way through! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a [pretty] simple game; 🍊 there's very little Leveling Up 🍋 involved or anything like that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There is a shop that you can 🍋 buy items, using your bells. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You don't actually find the shop; 🍊 you can access it anytime by hitting, 🍊 I believe it is, your Select button. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This will also give you 🍋 your stats, as they are, 🍊 and tell you 🍋 what floor they're on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's one of those little 🍋 outdoor areas I mentioned. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It looks kind of like 🍋 "Nazo no Mura... Murasame...", 🍋 actually. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, here's the, uh, screen 🍋 where we can, sort of, 🍊 choose different things to go to. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's the shopkeeper; 🍊 there's also a lady 🍋 who gives you advice. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is [pretty] easy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The monsters aren't that difficult 🍊 - certainly a lot easier 🍋 to figure out than "...Zelda"; 🍊 there's really no puzzles in it 🍋 (as far as I can tell) 🍊 and there are frequent, uh, 🍋 items that will refill your health. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, really, "Adian no Tsue" 🍋 is an incredibly minor title 🍊 from Sunsoft 🍋 (uh, a company which produced 🍋 a lot of minor titles so far) 🍊 and [pretty] much 🍋 completely forgettable, 🍊 once you get over the weird 🍋 concept of combining "...Zelda" 🍋 dungeons with a math game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, I found the staircase there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And now I'll go from 🍋 Level 1 to Level 2... 🍊 ...which is exactly the 🍋 same as the first level. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nazo no Kabe - Block Kuzushi 🇯🇵 // Crackout 🇪🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 13 🇯🇵 // 1991 [?] [?] 🇪🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 // Palcom 🇪🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's another F.D.S. game... 🍋 with a rather lame title screen: 🍊 "Nazo no Kabe": Block Kuzushi" 🍋 by Konami. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (That name means 🍋 'Riddle of the Wall: Block Destruction'.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly, this game was actually 🍋 released in Europe in 1991, 🍊 under the name "Crackout", 🍋 but never in the U.S. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Nazo no Kabe" is 🍋 a cool little game, 🍊 but it definitely cannot 🍋 be called original, 🍊 since it's a [pretty] blatant 🍋 clone of Taito's "Arkanoid". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It actually managed to beat 🍋 "Arkanoid" to the FamiCom 🍋 by around a week. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for those of you who are 🍋 not familiar with the basic, 🍊 uh, style of this game, 🍊 the premise goes 🍋 all the way back 🍊 to the 1976 Atari 🍋 Arcade game, "Breakout". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's the classic 🍋 Atari 2600 version of the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Breakout" is sort of like 🍋 a single player version of Pong. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The ide... idea is simply 🍋 to hit the ball with your paddle 🍋 and destroy the wall of bricks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In 1986, Taito revived this idea 🍋 with their big arcade hit, "Arkanoid", 🍊 added such, uh, enhancements 🍋 such as power-ups 🍊 and enemies that fly 🍋 across the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And "Nazo no Kabe" is sort of an 🍋 enhanced version of "Arkanoid". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It adds more complicated 🍋 brick structures, 🍊 and more enemies to destroy, 🍊 and as well as 🍋 additional power-ups, 🍊 such as that "Castlevania"-like 🍋 stopwatch, there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, even Konami Man, himself, 🍋 makes an appearance. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you catch him, 🍊 it'll let you move on 🍋 to the next level, 🍊 without destroying 🍋 all the blocks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There we go. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Note the odd little "Puyo Puyo"-like 🍋 enemy floating around in this level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I'm sure that's 🍋 just a coincidence. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At any rate, all these 🍋 additional elements 🍊 actually make this game 🍋 [pretty] fun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think I probably like it 🍋 more than "Arkanoid", actually. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Even had stationary bosses 🍋 that you need to destroy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's actually [only] one boss in 🍋 "Arkanoid", on the very last level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this game has them 🍋 scattered throughout the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These things usually take 🍋 quite a few hits to destroy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And one thing that 🍋 "Nazo no Kabe" does: 🍊 it has... has added some 🍋 additional power-ups to the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Some of them are copied 🍋 right out of "Arkanoid", 🍊 but there are 🍋 other ones as well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Note the, sort of, 🍋 Science Fiction theme here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Again, that's copied 🍋 straight out of "Arkanoid". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 "Breakout" didn't really have 🍋 any particular theme to it, 🍊 whereas "Arkanoid" added, sort of, 🍋 like, uh, space ships and, uh, 🍊 aliens and whatnot to the 🍋 whole, uh, "Breakout" idea. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Some of the power-ups: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's the one that makes 🍋 your paddle extra long. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also the power-up 🍋 that gives you, uh, 🍋 two balls in the air at once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like in "Arkanoid", 🍋 there are blocks that 🍋 take multiple hits to break. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there is one major problem 🍋 with "Nazo no Kabe" 🍊 and that's the controls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 Traditionally these games 🍋 use a rotary paddle 🍊 for fast accurate control 🍊 and the D-Pad simply doesn't 🍋 work quite as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It can't fly across the screen 🍊 in order to stop 🍋 an out of control ball, 🍊 the way you can 🍋 with a rotary paddle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 Konami has compensated 🍊 by giving the game 🍋 less horizontal space. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the bottom line is that 🍋 "Breakout" clones really 🍋 work best with a rotary paddle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Regardless, 🍊 this game is a lot of fun 🍋 and I would highly recommend it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... I think I like it a little 🍋 better than "Arkanoid" itself. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Suishō no Doragon 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 15 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Square
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by DOG 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is 🍋 yet another F.D.S. game 🍊 and it is from 🍋 our good buddies, Square, 🍊 or rather it was 🍋 developed by Square 🍊 and published by Square's 🍋 new subsidiary, D.O.G. 🍊 (Disk Original Group). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 D.O.G. was sort of a consortium 🍋 of various small developers 🍊 and was created specifically 🍋 to release games on the F.D.S. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll see a number of D.O.G. 🍋 titles released, uh, 🍊 but most of them, like this game, 🍋 really aren't very good. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Suishō no Doragon" is 🍋 a Text Adventure game - 🍊 one of the earliest 🍋 Text Adventure games on the FamiCom, 🍊 but it's really closer to 🍋 "Dead Zone" than to "Portopia". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There is some sort of plot 🍋 to "Suishō no Doragon" 🍊 but it's difficult to ascertain 🍋 what exactly is going on 🍋 by playing the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By the way, we're actually 🍋 gonna be looking at 🍊 an unofficial 🍋 English translation here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game, of course, was 🍋 never released outside of Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I can [only] assume the 🍋 Japanese game came with 🍊 some sort of detailed 🍋 instruction book 🍊 that laid out all the 🍋 characters and the back-story. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It sort of starts out suddenly 🍋 with your main character 🍊 running into a 🍋 mysterious space dragon 🍊 and then a mysterious 🍋 green-haired woman named Jean. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll soon find yourself 🍋 back on your planet, 🍊 but there, ah, isn't really 🍋 that much exploration you can do. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 From the main screen 🍋 with the, uh, news broadcast, 🍊 you can move a couple screens 🍋 in each direction 🍊 and usually there is 🍋 somebody waiting for you 🍊 at the end of each direction. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And occasionally 🍋 other characters will pop up, 🍊 but they really aren't introduced, 🍊 so very little of what actually 🍋 happens in the game makes sense. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently, people are disappearing 🍋 and you have to find 'em. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as you may have noticed, 🍋 this game doesn't use text commands, 🍊 like, uh, "Portopia" or "Dead Zone" 🍋 did, but rather little icons, 🍊 for, uh, well, let's see: there's 🍊 Move, Look, Pick Up, Talk, Use, 🍋 Open Door, et cetera. et cetera. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's actually really 🍋 not very much dialogue. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 You do have limited interaction 🍋 with other people at several points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But most of the game 🍋 is stuff like this: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 How do you open the door? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, pick out your revolver 🍋 and shoot off the lock; 🍊 then, go inside the door. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 What do you do, then? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, look around 🍋 inside the single room 🍊 until you notice 🍋 there's a false panel; 🍊 then open it and 🍋 touch the computer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you'll get some kind 🍋 of plot point that appears. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Actually, this section right here 🍋 is one of the very few sections 🍊 where you can actually 🍋 lose the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Jean will ...pea... appear 🍊 and, uh, try to shoot you 🍋 if you don't shoot her first. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you can actually 🍋 die in this section. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of the time, though, 🍋 you spend most of the game 🍊 just, sort of, running here, 🍋 going there, opening this door, 🍊 using this particular item 🍋 at a particular spot, 🍊 et cetera, et cetera. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But this game is a long way 🍋 from Enix's "Portopia" 🍊 with its large cast of characters 🍊 and interesting, uh, 🍋 red herrings and dead ends 🍊 and leads that 🍋 take you to new areas, 🍊 and so on [and] so forth. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, there are actually 🍋 several locales in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, your home planet, 🍊 you fly around in space on what is 🍋 apparently some sort of space scooter, 🍊 and you actually have to go 🍋 to a couple other planets, 🍊 neither of which 🍋 are very interesting. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At various points, 🍋 you collect certain items 🍊 (or if you have 🍋 items given to you) 🍊 that [pretty] much usually 🍋 [only] have one use - maybe two. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game does occasionally 🍋 get a bit frustrating. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some parts, 🍊 like on your home planet, I mean, 🍋 are extremely easy to navigate. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In other cases, 🍋 like when you're in outer space, 🍊 you just sort of wander around 🍋 randomly until you run into a planet. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yes, and here 🍋 you get 999 credits, 🍊 even though... I don't see 🍋 how you can actually use them, 🍊 so what's the point? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, eventually you go 🍋 to this one planet 🍊 to find this mysterious pyramid, 🍋 use your magnetic tea to get... 🍊 key to get inside, uh, 🍊 then you wander around 🍋 until you find a computer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll find 🍋 some sort of glowing crystal orb. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose one thing that's 🍋 interesting about this game 🍊 is the appearance 🍋 of this crystal orb. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, 🍋 the early 'Final Fantasy' games 🍊 would make use of 🍋 something very similar. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, one other thing: 🍊 You may have noticed 🍋 on the title screen 🍊 that there is a copyright, uh, of 🍋 Character Design to Nippon Sunrise. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's a Japanese animation studio. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 Apparently this is not 🍋 based on an anime or a manga, 🍊 but um, rather the characters were 🍋 designed by this animation studio. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In particular, they were 🍋 the work of one Hajime Sato. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And one other thing that's 🍋 sort of unusual about this game 🍊 is that when it came out, 🍋 apparently it got 🍊 a certain amount of 🍋 notoriety in Japan, 🍊 due to some sort of rumor 🍊 that there's a way to make 🍋 the heroine, Cynthia, 🍊 who we saw just a second ago, 🍋 appear nude. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently, uh, doctored, uh, 🍋 video game screenshots 🍊 appeared in some magazine 🍋 or something. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This sounds like some intriguing 🍋 early version of Hot Coffee, 🍊 but no, apparently it's actually 🍋 a completely false rumor 🍊 and there's no way 🍋 to actually do that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, at this point in the game, 🍊 you finally meet the mastermind 🍋 behind all the kidnappings 🍊 and you defeat him by 🍋 throwing the crystal at him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then, guess what? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You've beat the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, this game is certainly 🍋 not that great 🍊 and I guess it's sort of typical 🍋 of the kind of, uh, shoddy product 🍊 (or at least uninspired product) 🍊 that Square was putting out, 🍋 at this time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Breeder 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 15 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Soft Pro
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Soft Pro 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not really sure how to 🍋 classify this game, "Breeder". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not so bad that it's kusoge, 🍊 but it's certainly 🍋 not any good either. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably the best thing about it 🍊 is the very cool 🍋 Roger Dean-style logo. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and make sure you pay 🍋 attention to this title intro here 🍊 because it's the most exciting thing 🍋 that happens the entire game! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Seriously, that's 🍋 more action right there 🍊 than will actually occur the 🍋 entire time you play this thing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was released by Soft Pro 🍊 and you might remember 🍋 Soft Pro being the same guys 🍊 that released the 🍋 FamiCom port of "Karateka". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were certainly 🍋 not a major publisher. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They released [only] a 🍋 hand few, uh, handful of titles 🍊 (mostly on the 🍋 FamiCom Disk System) 🍊 and they seem to 🍋 specialize in, sort of, 🍊 strategy simulation-type games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And that's more or less 🍋 what "Breeder" is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's sort of a robot creation / 🍋 robot fighting Simulation Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the important thing 🍋 to realize about this is 🍊 you create robots and they fight, 🍊 but you don't actually 🍋 control the fighting, itself. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So the game loads up here and 🍋 the first thing you'll wanna do 🍊 is actually maybe, uh, make some 🍋 'metal soldiers', as they call them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is [pretty] much the 🍋 [only] interactive part of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You can start by 🍋 giving your guy a name. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can have seven guys 🍋 in your roster. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Go ahead, put in a name and 🍋 once you've taken care of that, 🍊 then you'll need to actually, 🍋 sort of, add the attributes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this looks 🍋 rather R.P.G.-ish here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You've got things like 🍋 Dexterity and I.Q. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 [I'm] not really sure 🍋 what all of these do. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, what's the difference 🍋 between I.Q. and Mind, for example? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Go ahead and put in your qualities, uh, 🍋 select what kind of body you want, 🍋 how many legs, wheels, et cetera. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is type: Snake. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And go ahead and, 🍋 uh, have 'em fight! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the more, sort of, uh, 🍋 qualities you put on there, 🍊 the more it costs 🍋 and how much it costs 🍊 will actually, um, effect how 🍋 much fuel you use while fighting. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And now you're ready to go. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 These are two, sort of, 🍋 basic guys, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The blue guy is 🍋 actually the strong one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The, uh, pink one 🍋 is just the default 🍊 - everything set to zero. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, once again, remember 🍊 you're not actually 🍋 doing anything; 🍊 you're just watching this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And probably right away 🍋 you'll realize, 🍊 'Hey! This is not exciting!' 🍋 'They're not doing anything!' 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'They just sort of 🍋 wander around randomly 🍊 and occasionally hit each other.' 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We're almost to the, uh, 🍊 thrilling, uh, conclusion 🍋 of the fight, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In real time these 🍋 take quite a while - 🍊 maybe five minutes a fight? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah! There we go. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hope it was worth it! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Not really sure who 🍋 this game was aimed for. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, in theory 🍋 it might be interesting, 🍊 to be able to sort of fool around 🍋 with different attributes and see, 🍊 you know, how a robot 🍋 with high intelligence 🍊 would do against a robot with, 🍋 like, high armor or something, 🍊 but the actual fighting sequences 🍋 are so long, slow, and boring. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, this moves 🍋 very very slowly! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They very rarely actually fight 🍊 and half the time it's whoever runs 🍋 out of fuel, uh, quickest will lose! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, here, blue has, 🍋 uh, his stats pumped way up, 🍊 but he's using a lot of fuel 🍊 and he never really makes even 🍋 much contact with the pink guy! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, ah, blue will lose, 🍋 simply by running out of fuel, 🍊 so unfortunately the execution 🍋 of this game is so bad 🍊 that it really falls 🍋 into the category of 🍊 'Games-you-would-not-wanna-🍋 touch-with-a-ten-foot-pole'. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mashou 🇯🇵 // Deadly Towers 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 15 🇯🇵 // 1987-09 [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Lenar
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 // Brøderbund 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At last we come to 🍋 what is probably the 🍊 second most infamous game, 🍋 this episode, right behind 🍋 "Takeshi no Chōsenjō", 🍊 namely "Mashou" (or "Deadly Towers" 🍋 as it was renamed in the U.S.). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Mashou" was developed by Lenar 🍋 (who were also behind "Bird Week") 🍊 and published by IREM 🍋 (or by Brøderbund in the U.S.). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The U.S. release of this game was 🍋 not well-loved, to say the least. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Deadly Towers" is not known 🍋 for being a good game, 🍊 but became quite notorious, 🍋 mostly because of the, uh, 🍊 Internet pop-culture commentator, 🍋 Seanbaby, listing it as 🍊 'the worst N.E.S. game of all time'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not really that bad, 🍋 but it certainly isn't very good. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, 'mashou' means 'evil bell' 🍋 and the plot, 🍊 which was detailed in that lengthy 🍋 title screen scroll earlier, 🍊 involves young Prince Myer 🍋 climbing seven towers 🍊 in order to collect 🍋 a bell at each one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At this point, 🍋 the bells must be burned 🍊 in order to access 🍋 the evil Rubas' lair. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Deadly Towers" plays like an 🍋 entwisted evil version of "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You go around fighting 🍊 monsters that drop 🍋 health refills and money, 🍊 you can buy things 🍊 and find heart containers 🍋 that increase your life bar. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A note to future 🍋 video game designers: 🍊 The third monster 🍋 you face in the game 🍊 shouldn't take, like, 🍋 twenty hits to kill. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, just like "...Zelda", 🍊 "Deadly Towers" has 🍋 an overworld of sorts 🍊 (this castle that you start off in) 🍋 but it's relatively small. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You progress through it vertically 🍊 and there's [only] around 🍋 eight or so vertical levels 🍊 - each level being 🍋 a few screens wide. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The top level of a castle 🍋 is the room with the flame 🍊 used to burn the bells, 🍊 as well as the entrances 🍋 to the towers, themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course you can't go there directly 🍋 because the way is blocked. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is where 🍋 the game gets cruel. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This area that I'm in, right now, 🍋 is actually the dungeons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are ten dungeons in 🍋 "Deadly Towers", 🍊 all of which have 🍋 hidden entrances. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can't make 🍋 the entrance visible, 🍊 but rather you will unexpectedly 🍋 be transported to the dungeon, 🍊 simply by stepping on the square 🍋 where the entrance is found. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you're in the dungeon, 🍋 you can't just leave; 🍊 you actually have to find the exit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, every room of 🍋 the dungeon is [pretty] nondescript. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They certainly didn't put a lot of 🍋 effort into designing the dungeons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 All the shops are 🍋 found in the dungeons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, I want to 🍋 buy those boots 🍊 that will make me 🍋 walk a little faster, 🍊 but unfortunately I don't 🍋 have nearly enough money yet. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the thing 🍋 about the dungeons is: 🍊 each one consists of around 🍋 100 to 200 interconnected 🍊 virtually identical rooms, 🍋 each filled with monsters, 🍊 some of which will kill you 🍋 instantly upon entering the room. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So when you suddenly find 🍋 yourself inside of a dungeon, 🍊 there's no way of really knowing 🍋 where you are or where the exit is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Furthermore, 🍋 you actually have to 🍊 navigate through the dungeons, 🍋 in order to find the shops, 🍊 in order to get the key 🍋 to get past the roadblock. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The shops sell different items, 🍊 so it's gonna be quite difficult 🍋 to have to navigate through 🍊 the, oh, I don't know, 🍋 1,500 to 2,000 dungeon rooms, 🍊 in order to find 🍋 what you're looking for. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, I've gotten 🍋 through the dungeons 🍊 and am back in the castle, 🍋 at the room where the flame is 🍊 and those are actually 🍋 entrances to the towers, 🍋 right there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you get to the entrance 🍋 of the towers, themselves, 🍊 you'll find they're 🍋 actually [pretty] simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Essentially, you just go 🍋 up ten flights of stairs 🍊 to the entrance 🍋 of the actual tower, 🍊 then, uh, ten more flights up, 🍋 connected by ladders to the boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of the bosses 🍋 are actually [pretty] easy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, 🍋 a number of very important items 🍊 are found in the towers, 🍋 but they're almost all hidden, 🍊 requiring you to find a 🍋 hidden teleportation square 🍊 in order to get to them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game, itself, will 🍋 be extremely difficult 🍊 without these helpful 🍋 armor and weapons, 🍊 hidden in the towers. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This, right here, 🍋 is one of the towers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Those little guys in devil suits 🍋 look [pretty] bad-ass, 🍊 but actually they're 🍋 not very tough at all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They're a lot easier to kill 🍋 than those little blue blo... 🍊 blue blobs floating around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there really aren't a whole 🍋 lot of enemies in the towers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some of the floors don't 🍋 have any enemies at all. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The hidden items I mentioned 🍊 are basically found by sort of 🍋 wandering around on the floor 🍊 until you suddenly step on the 🍋 magic square that'll take you 🍊 to the room where the 🍋 hidden armor or weapon is. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here is one of the bosses, 🍋 right here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of the bosses can be spammed, 🍋 simply by standing in a corner 🍊 and shooting some knives 🍋 diagonally at them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All the bosses have more or less 🍋 the same attack pattern 🍊 and all the towers 🍋 are very very similar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy looks [pretty] tough, 🍋 but is actually a piece [of] cake. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By this time I've gotten some 🍋 additional weapons and items 🍊 that allow me to throw 🍊 much more powerful swords 🍋 at a much faster rate. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 All of this underlies the 🍋 main problem of the game: 🍊 that upon beginning it, 🍋 your character is extremely 🍋 slow and underpowered 🍊 (trying to navigate around 🍋 the castle and dungeons 🍊 will get you lost, 🍋 probably permanently) 🍊 and most folks will actually... 🍊 may never make it 🍋 to the towers themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Trying to find your way around 🍋 the dungeons is absurdly hard, 🍊 unless you have a map, 🍊 however, it's not 🍋 really that hard, 🍊 once you've gotten 🍋 to the towers. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've collected a bell, 🍊 you'll then go ahead 🍋 and drop it to the fire. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This will magically 🍋 replenish your health. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, basically, you just 🍋 do this for all seven towers. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Continue to collect 🍋 more special items, 🍊 and once you've got 🍋 all seven of the bells, 🍊 the door to Rubas' lair 🍋 will open up, 🍊 unless, of course, 🍊 you happen to accidentally 🍋 step into a teleportation square 🍊 and get stuck in a dungeon 🍋 like I just did here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, of course, I have to 🍋 find my way out of the thing again 🍊 and I have no idea where I am. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So here's the final climb, 🍋 right here - not really too bad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And once you get to Rubas, 🍋 you'll find that 🍊 he's almost certainly the 🍋 most difficult boss [of] the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, for the most part, 🍊 "Deadly Towers" is 🍋 horrifically unbalanced. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [only] really difficult part 🍋 in the second half of the game 🍊 is fighting Rubas, himself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Add in some wonky controls 🍋 and the fact that 🍊 being hit by an enemy will 🍊 often cause you to slide 🍋 down the screen off a cliff 🍊 and you get a game that 🍋 a lot of people really hate. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The trick to Rubas 🍋 is to stand in between him 🍊 and those little dragon heads 🍋 floating around him 🍊 and slowly make your way to the 🍋 right hand side of the screen, 🍊 then start hitting him 🍋 with your sword. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And at this point, 🍋 you get a weird ending. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What are those 🍋 little things flying down? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I actually thought 🍋 I had done something wrong. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But no, suddenly it's 🍋 raining little, um... 🍊 well, I really can't say 🍋 what those are supposed to be. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it must be a good thing 🍋 because you've now finished the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, there we have "Deadly Towers". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No, it's not a good game, 🍊 but it's not nearly 🍋 as bad as you might think. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I get that, sort of, 🍋 the apotheosis of the idea of 🍊 'things in video games 🍋 should be hidden' à la "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Everything in this game is hidden: 🍋 the dungeons, the entrances, 🍊 virtually all the important items, 🍋 the shops... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's all been taken 🍋 to such an extreme 🍊 that the game is 🍋 very difficult to play, 🍊 though I guess it's still better 🍋 than the "Takeshi Kitano" game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Metro-Cross 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 16 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco | Now Production
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's a game we'll have to 🍋 file under: Just-Plain-Weird: 🍊 Namco's "Metro-Cross". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a port of 🍋 their 1985 Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was eventually ported to 🍋 a number of computer systems, 🍊 as well as this 🍋 Japan-[only] FamiCom version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you examine the cover, 🍋 you'll notice you are jumping 🍊 over what are inarguably 🍋 over-sized Coca-Cola cans. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll also encounter 🍊 normal-sized blue soda cans 🍋 in the game itself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Exactly what this means, 🍋 I'm really not sure. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object of the game is 🍊 to run through this obstacle course 🍋 before the timer runs out, 🍊 jumping over objects and 🍊 avoiding patches in the floor 🍋 that will kill you or slow you down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You sometimes find helpful items, 🍋 such as springboards or skateboards. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you don't beat the timer, 🍋 you are electrocuted. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game obviously takes place in 🍋 some sort of dystopian future world 🍊 where citizens are forced to 🍋 participate in deadly sporting events 🍊 for the amusement of 🍋 their corporate overlords. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And for added humiliation, 🍊 they apparently have to 🍋 do this while naked. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, your character is definitely 🍋 not wearing any clothes in this game, 🍊 even though on the cover he seemed 🍋 to be wearing some sort of, uh, outfit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍋 It's all very disturbing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍋 As for the game, itself, 🍊 well I guess it's 🍋 entertaining for a little while, 🍊 though it's hardly a classic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the third level, 🍋 which has all the springboards, 🍊 I found it [pretty] difficult to 🍋 actually jump over them correctly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 More than anything else, 🍋 I found myself wondering, 🍊 "Uh... 🍊 What's all this obsession 🍋 with soda goin' on, here?" 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game might be 🍋 some sort of political comment. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm... 🍋 I'm really not sure. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, on "Metro-Cross", 🍋 I'll definitely say, uh, 🍊 'Give this one a try 🍋 for an unusual and, uh, 🍋 not very well-known game.' 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once little sparks go flying there, 🍋 you're about to get electrocuted. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I guess it 🍋 doesn't really kill him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍋 Yeah, so "Metro-Cross"... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Strange game, um... 🍋 definitely worth a look. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 King Kong 2: Ikari no Megaton Punch 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 18 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, this would almost 🍋 certainly be considered to be 🍊 the best game we're 🍋 gonna see this episode: 🍊 "King Kong 2: Ikari no Megaton Punch". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it starts out with a really 🍋 great introductory cut scene, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, it looks like King Kong 🍋 misses his girlfriend 🍊 and is about to go on a rampage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's the plot of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you're wondering, 🍊 'What is this about "King Kong 2"? 🍋 Was there a "King Kong 1" game?', 🍊 no, this is actually based on 🍋 the 1986 film, "King Kong Lives", 🍊 which was known as 🍋 "King Kong 2" in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "King Kong Lives" 🍋 was the sequel to the 🍊 1976 Dino De Laurentiis 🍋 remake of "King Kong" 🍊 and, just like that 🍋 earlier 'King Kong' movie, 🍊 "King Kong Lives" is 🍋 really not very good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There really weren't a lot of 🍋 video games based on films 🍋 at this time, 🍊 so why did this particular 🍋 movie get made into a game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You control Kong 🍋 and you can jump and punch. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And as you collect rocks, 🍋 you can also throw rocks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There're various power-ups 🍋 throughout the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍊 that little potion there will 🍋 increase your speed slightly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll also find, uh, 🍋 Life bar increases, 🍊 power-ups that will increase 🍋 the strength of your rocks, 🍊 and will increase your 🍋 rock-carrying capacity. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is played on a series 🍋 of interlinked screens, here, 🍊 as you can see, sort of 🍋 like a game like "Pitfall", 🍊 [only] it's vertical 🍋 instead of horizontal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The screens are 🍋 mostly relatively linear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Occasionally, you'll come 🍋 across a screen with, uh, 🍊 more than one way to go, 🍋 but for [the] most part, 🍊 you just, sort of, 🍋 walk in one direction 🍊 (uh... usually up, 🍋 occasionally from side to side). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some of later levels 🍋 are a bit more maze-like, 🍊 in the sense that you can often 🍋 go in multiple directions 🍊 and sometimes you 🍋 can't get to one screen 🍊 from a certain direction. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 That little star, there, 🍋 is an invincibility star. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, I think if you've played 🍋 games at all, uh, like this, 🍊 you'll probably pick 🍋 this one up [pretty] quickly, 🍊 mostly jump around, smash things, 🍋 kill [a] lot [of] enemies, 🍊 grab the various items 🍋 they leave behind, 🍊 avoid things like the, uh, 🍋 tanks that spew flame. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, that little door 🍋 right there, um, 🍊 is where we can get 🍋 one of our first power-ups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [an] artificial heart. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the "King Kong Lives" movie, 🍊 King Kong somehow survived 🍋 his fall off the building, 🍊 was given a new heart, 🍊 and then met a female 🍋 King Kong and fell in love. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And that's sort of 🍋 what this game is about; 🍊 you're looking for your girlfriend. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I mentioned the levels were linear 🍋 and that's really not quite true. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Scattered throughout the game 🍋 are these little doors 🍊 that will often warp you to 🍋 either another part of the level 🍊 or to another level entirely. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, for example, 🍋 I was just transported 🍊 to another screen 🍋 in the same level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Most levels are around 🍋 20 - 25 screens long. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a boss in each level and 🍋 there's nine levels altogether. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, while this game is 🍋 physically not very large, 🍊 most of the environment 🍋 can be destroyed, 🍊 either by smashing with your fist 🍋 or by jumping on it 🍊 and a lot of time is spent 🍋 around smashing things, uh, 🍊 looking for all the 🍋 various hidden items. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 on that little boat, right there, 🍊 I will find a hidden door 🍋 that'll take me to this boss, 🍊 which is a giant clam 🍋 that shoots fireballs. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's certainly, 🍋 uh, I mean... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is inspired [only] 🍋 very very loosely on the movie. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... Thi... 🍊 This really bears no 🍋 resemblance to the film at all. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, once you defeat the boss, 🍋 you get a key. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you have all eight keys, 🍋 you can then go to the last level 🍊 and free your girlfriend. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the fact there are 🍋 all of these little, sort of, 🍊 hidden doors - hidden warps 🍊 makes the world somewhat 🍋 confusing to get around in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'd probably want to 🍊 take notes or draw a map 🍋 as you're playing this game, 🍊 otherwise you'll 🍋 really have a hard time 🍊 finding your way around it 🍋 with so many, uh, levels 🍊 composed of, sort of, 🍋 very similar-looking screens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah, there's another warp, 🍋 right there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I'm taken to someplace else 🍋 in the same level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Coming up, here, is one of the 🍋 weirdest levels in the whole game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It takes place during a city, 🍋 but, um, for some reason 🍊 is invested with, uh, giant, 🍋 red, fireball-shooting ducks! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Again, I'm [pretty] sure 🍊 there was nothing even remotely 🍋 like this in the film, itself. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, is this game 🍋 any good or not? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍋 Yeah, it is [pretty] good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a typical 🍋 quality title from Konami. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd say it's probably the 🍋 best game in this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] doesn't quite stack up, next 🍋 to something like "Castlevania", 🍊 but it's certainly [pretty] fun 🍋 and playable, um, nice environments, 🍊 it is [pretty] satisfying 🍋 getting to smash things 🍊 and, um, whenever you jump, 🍋 there's a rather nice chunky 🍊 kind of, uh, screen-shaking 🍋 thump as you land. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Some of the enemies 🍋 can be a bit annoying, 🍊 like the fact they're constantly 🍋 shooting missiles at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you don't like 🍋 exploration-type games, 🍊 where everything is 🍋 hidden from plain view, 🍊 you might not like this, 🍋 but I will admit 🍊 it is [pretty] fun, 🍋 jumping around, 🍋 smashing stuff up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing that makes 🍋 this game kind of charming 🍊 is just the fact that 🍋 it's so damn weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What exactly are all 🍋 those, uh, ducks doing 🍊 and what are all 🍋 these things, anyway? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What does this really have 🍋 anything to do with 'King Kong'? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I guess it 🍋 doesn't really matter, 🍊 because the game 🍋 is fun to play 🍊 and I'd say definitely 🍋 give it a try, 🍊 even though it's hardly the 🍋 best game that Konami made 🍊 around this time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Wing of Madoola 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 18 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sunsoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Released the same day as 🍋 "King Kong 2" 🍊 was this Sunsoft title, 🍋 "[The] Wing of Madoola" 🍊 (sometimes called 🍋 "Madoola no Tsubasa" 🍊 or even 🍋 "Madūra no Tsubasa"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, like a few other 🍋 recent titles, uh, 🍊 (such as "Gall Force...", 🍋 "Space Hunter", and "Metroid") 🍊 your character is female! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Madoola" is actually a 🍋 rather unique inversion 🍊 of the traditional 🍋 video game plot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character, Lucia, is 🍋 trying to rescue a prince! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Madoola" is a 🍋 side-scrolling Platformer, 🍊 albeit one without 🍋 much real platforming. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Lucia is armed, 🍊 so you might compare this to 🍋 earlier Sunsoft Platformers, 🍊 such as "Tōkaidō Gojūsan-tsugi" 🍋 or "Atlantis no Nazo". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it might even remind you 🍋 of good ol' "Castlevania", 🍊 even though "Castlevania" 🍊 was still a [pretty] new 🍋 game when this came out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One addition to the standard 🍋 side-scrolling Platformer formula 🍊 is that "Madoola" has some light 🍊 R.P.G./"...Zelda"/"Metroid"-esque 🍋 elements thrown in, 🍊 through the introduction of 🍊 a steady stream of power-ups 🍋 you collect. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In every level, 🍊 you find a couple [of] items 🍋 that will improve your abilities, 🍊 uh, such as boots that 🍋 allow you to jump higher 🍊 and consecutively more powerful 🍋 swords... and even magic spells. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Lucia also has 🍋 Hit Points and Magic Points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is the first boss - 🍋 some sort of guy inside an eggshell! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Much like "Castlevania", 🍋 after you defeat him, 🍊 you can then collect 🍋 a health refill. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There it is, right there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing about "Madoola": 🍊 the enemies are hard to kill, 🍋 even at early levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, in Level 2 🍊 you'll come across all 🍋 these little purple blobs 🍊 that tend to 🍋 surround you in groups, 🍊 but they take 🍋 multiple hits to kill. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's really no way 🍋 you can take 'em on, 🍊 so you'll need to try to outrun 'em! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is actually true of 🍋 a lot of enemies in the game 🍊 - so much so that 🍋 you'll eventually end up 🍊 usually jumping over enemies 🍋 or just trying to avoid them, 🍊 rather than actually 🍋 engaging them in combat! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You see here, 🍊 just how much trouble 🍋 these purple blobs give you! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, enemies often 🍋 come at you 🍊 at very strange angles 🍋 and sometimes very quickly 🍊 so it's difficult to 🍊 actually fight the enemies 🍋 without taking damage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know about you, but I 🍋 don't really like this in a game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It seems to me that when 🍋 I spend the entire level, 🍊 sort of, trying to run and 🍋 jump over all the enemies 🍊 it doesn't really seem like 🍋 I'm actually playing the game, 🍊 but rather I'm just, sort of, 🍋 rushing through the levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's something 🍋 I don't really get. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Looks like a boss level 🍋 with no boss in it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess it's just an empty room. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, all of that said, this game 🍋 actually looks [pretty] decent. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's quite a bit of 🍋 variety in the levels, 🍊 like you started over ground 🍊 and then move through 🍋 these underground caverns, 🍊 and then you, sort of, uh, get 🍋 a lot of variety in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Madoola" is probably 🍊 the closest thing to a good game 🍋 Sunsoft has come out with, so far. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, 🍋 considering some previous titles 🍊 were "Super Arabian" 🍋 and "Atlantis no Nazo", 🍊 maybe that's not 🍋 really saying much, 🍊 but this definitely shows Sunsoft 🍋 moving in the right direction. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As we can see, 🍋 collecting that energy refill, 🍊 that it doesn't actually 🍋 refill your hit points 🍋 entirely - [only] partially. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Madoola" definitely 🍋 has some problems. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I've already mentioned, most [of] the 🍋 enemies are a little hard to kill 🍊 and also the controls 🍋 are not quite right - 🍊 definitely better than 🍋 "Atlantis no Nazo", 🍊 but the platform parts are 🍋 still quite a bit of pain. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If anyone ever complains about the 🍋 controls for attacking and jumping 🍊 in the first "Castlevania" game, 🍋 have them play this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That will give them 🍋 some perspective. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Trying to jump on these things 🍋 is really not a lot of fun. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, all in all, 🍋 "Madoola", a great game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No, definitely not. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 An improvement over 🍋 previous Sunsoft titles? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Absolutely! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Deep Dungeon 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 18 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HummingBirdSoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by DOG 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The last two games this episode 🍋 are both F.D.S. games 🍊 and both released December 19th. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First up, we'll do "Deep Dungeon"! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It sounds like an 🍋 S and M porn title 🍊 but is actually an old 🍋 old old-school R.P.G., 🍊 developed by Humming Bird Soft. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, it's the second release on 🍋 Square's new F.D.S. imprint, D.O.G. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Humming Bird Soft 🍋 actually started out 🍊 as a real estate company 🍋 before moving into video games 🍋 in the early '80s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They released titles on 🍋 a few different systems 🍊 before disappearing altogether 🍋 in the mid-'90s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I believe there were a total 🍋 of four "Deep Dungeon" games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, according to this title scroll 🍊 (and we're looking at an 🍋 unofficial English translation) 🍊 once again, there's 🍋 a missing princess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The plot here seems somewhat 🍋 similar to the beginning of 🍋 "Dragon Warrior", 🍊 but "Deep Dungeon" 🍋 doesn't actually take its 🍋 inspiration from that game, 🍊 but rather from much earlier 🍋 U.S. R.P.G.s like "Wizardry". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there is an Inn 🍊 and Stores where you can buy 🍋 Weapons, Magic, and Supplies, 🍊 but there's really no 🍋 outside world in this game 🍊 (no... mountains and forests 🍋 and towns and that sort of thing). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In true dungeon crawler fashion, 🍊 everything takes place 🍋 inside the dungeon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You basically start out 🍋 at the top of the dungeon 🍊 and your goal is to get to 🍋 the bottom of the dungeon 🍊 (that's the eighth floor) 🍋 and then kill the main bad guy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As usual, the cheap-ass king 🍋 gives you a measly 200 gold pieces 🍊 so you can buy a simple weapon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you descend and 🍋 you're in the dungeon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 How this game is played is: 🍋 you enter the dungeon, 🍊 killing monsters, collecting gold, 🍋 and earn experience, 🍊 while occasionally heading 🍋 back up to rest at the inn 🍊 and spend your money. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then head back down, 🍋 explore a little bit deeper. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Later, you will actually find 🍋 shops inside the dungeon itself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you get enough Experience, 🍋 you'll level up, 🍊 and your Hit Points will increase. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You also have Attack (that's A.P.) 🍋 and Defense (that's A.C.) 🍊 but, as far as I can tell, 🍊 those can [only] be increased 🍋 by buying weapons and armor. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the dungeons, aside from 🍋 monsters and treasure, 🍊 you'll occasionally 🍋 encounter an N.P.C. 🍊 (usually a helpful friendly 🍋 warrior you can talk to 🍊 who'll give you a little hint) 🍊 and occasionally 🍋 you'll find a message. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One rather interesting thing 🍋 about this game is 🍊 it seems that most of your money 🍊 comes from these 🍋 little piles of trash 🍊 that are scattered 🍋 all over the place. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every time you come across one, 🍋 you examine it and it contains 🍊 either gold or a monster... 🍋 or maybe even both! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can kill the monsters 🍋 for Experience, 🍊 and obviously the gold 🍋 you can keep. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly enough, 🍋 when you re-enter a level, 🍊 the trash will be re-stocked, 🍋 so you can check 'em again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Deep Dungeon" is 🍋 probably the [only] R.P.G. 🍊 where you spend a 🍋 considerable amount of time 🍊 rummaging through 🍋 piles of garbage. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you may have noticed, this 🍋 dungeon is [pretty] nondescript. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 You have no in-game map, 🍋 at least not immediately. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can actually buy one a 🍋 little bit later in the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you'll probably 🍋 need to draw a map. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, the main challenge 🍋 of the game seems to be 🍊 finding your way 🍋 around the dungeon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Something else is a little 🍋 different from "Dragon Warrior" 🍊 about this game is 🍊 you don't really seem to encounter 🍋 very many random monsters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They mostly exist in preset 🍋 locations like this thief here 🍊 (who is always in this little room) 🍋 or in piles of trash. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, wandering around 🍋 the, uh, dungeons, 🍊 you actually very rarely 🍋 just encounter random monsters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This can sometimes make your 🍋 experience a bit hard to collect. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... That's why you're often 🍋 going back to the piles of trash. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You will see me Level-Up here 🍋 in just a second. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A charming little heroic 🍋 Level-Up theme plays. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, after I finish off this 🍋 skeleton I get five Experience Points, 🍊 uh, taking me up to, I guess, 60 🍋 and then I'm in the third Level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you may have noticed, 🍊 it doesn't actually increase 🍋 your Attack power or your Defense. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, what are the good and 🍋 bad points about this game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I guess the good points 🍋 is it was rather ambitious 🍊 for Humming Bird Soft 🍋 to attempt a game like this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is actually the very 🍋 first first-person-R.P.G. 🍊 released on the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, there actually haven't 🍋 been that many R.P.G.s at all! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On the negative side, this 🍋 game really isn't that great. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, consider that 🍋 this was based on games 🍊 that were already around 🍋 six or seven years old 🍊 when this came out 🍋 (games like "Wizardry")! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So this is [pretty] old-fashioned, 🍊 even though, obviously 🍋 the graphics are much better 🍊 than you would see on 🍋 those old Apple games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, I've taken a moment to 🍋 go back to the inn and rest; 🍊 this will replenish 🍋 your health and whatnot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, buying bread will 🍋 replenish your health 🍊 and, uh, water will (oddly enough) 🍋 cure you of the Poison status. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is pretty, uh, small 🍊 in terms of the amount of 🍋 items and magic available. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I believe there's around maybe 🍋 eight weapons in the game altogether 🍊 - I think six different types of magic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Magic is actually 🍋 purchased at a store. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the combat is also 🍋 slightly frustrating; 🍊 it seems to be 🍋 completely randomized. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sometimes very minor enemies will 🍋 deal out huge amounts of damage 🍊 and enemies tend to 🍋 dodge an awful lot. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this game is, quite frankly, 🍋 [pretty] boring and repetitive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The lack of any sort of 🍋 real plot or characterization 🍊 or anything like that makes the 🍋 game sort of on the dull side. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Knight Lore 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 19 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare | Jaleco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Sadly, we have now reached 🍋 the last game this episode: 🍊 "Knight Lore", published by Jaleco 🍋 and licensed from... Rare? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Yes, this is a Rare game and we'll 🍋 discuss that [in] just a moment, 🍊 but first, check out this awesomely 🍋 terrible introduction screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 My god! 🍋 Those flashing rectangles! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's like something you 🍋 would program in ten minutes 🍊 back on an old Apple II. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so this is actually a port 🍋 of Rare's 1984 computer game, 🍊 originally released for the 🍋 British computer, the Z.X. Spectrum. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is an F.D.S. game, 🍊 so you can create a profile 🍋 and save your game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Back then, English 🍋 developers traditionally 🍊 had really awful names 🍋 and Rare was no exception. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Back in 1984 🍋 they called themselves 🍊 "Ultimate: Play the Game" 🍋 for some reason. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By the time, uh, this game 🍋 came out for the FamiCom, 🍊 they had changed 🍋 their name to "Rare". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Knight Lore", like a lot 🍋 of old Spectrum games, 🍊 is very fondly remembered 🍋 by fans of the system 🍊 and highly regarded 🍋 in those circles; 🍊 and, like a lot of Spectrum games, 🍋 is actually [pretty] terrible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You play this little elf 🍊 (well, actually in the original 🍋 computer version he was more like 🍊 explorer guy, with a 🍋 pith helmet or something) 🍊 ...but you play this little elf 🍋 who, uh, suffers from, lycanthropy 🍊 and turns into a werewolf 🍋 about every thirty seconds. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can see the little 🍋 night and day cycle thing, 🍊 running in the corner there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you roam around the world, 🍋 avoiding traps and collecting items, 🍊 eventually putting them into 🍋 a magic pot to obtain a cure. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, back when the Spectrum 🍋 version first came out, uh, 🍊 this game was, uh, considered 🍋 to be [pretty] pioneering. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was one of the 🍋 first video games 🍊 (or rather, one of the 🍋 first home video games) 🍊 to use isometric perspective. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll probably remember that 🍊 in, uh, Arcade games like, 🍋 uh, "Q-Bert" or "Congo Bongo". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 Today, the game just seems 🍋 sort of boring and pointless 🍊 from a gameplay perspective. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This FamiCom port looks 🍋 substantially different 🍊 than the original 🍋 Spectrum version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The characters and levels 🍋 have all been reworked, 🍊 apparently by Jaleco, themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Trying to move around, using the D-Pad 🍋 is really an exercise in frustration. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Still, the transformation 🍋 animation is [pretty] amusing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... Nevertheless, 🍊 "Knight Lore" hasn't really 🍋 stood the test of time very well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, sorry to end this episode on 🍋 sort of a disappointing note, uh, 🍊 but next episode we'll be seeing some, 🍋 uh, rather, uh, more interesting games. 🍇🍌
