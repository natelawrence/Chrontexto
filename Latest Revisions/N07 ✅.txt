👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 7 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hi, and welcome to "...Episode 7" of 'Chrontendo.' 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's some interesting things {in} this episode, but first of all, let's take a look at the last few games released in the butt end of 1985. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Binary Land 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 19 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, first up in this episode, we have the first of two games released on December 19th by Hudson Soft. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The first one, here, is "Binary Land". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} first thing ya d... -- do is choose which character ya wanna control - the pink one or the green one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is an old-school-style Puzzle Game, originally released in 1983 on various Japanese Computers. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This N.E.S. port, here, has updated graphics, and a few little changes have been made. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game might remind you a little bit of "Nuts 'n' Milk". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game is rather unusual in that you [only] control one character but two move. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The one on the right-hand side, there (the green penguin) is the one that you're controlling. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The pink penguin will move in a mirrored left to right direction. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, if you press Right on your Control Pad, the pink penguin will move left. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The object is to get both penguins to touch the caged heart at the same time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Along the way, you can be killed by spiders or get stuck in cobwebs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, you have a little ray gun that can [be] used to destroy spiders or cobwebs. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I think the main challenge in this game is, sort of, learning to think, uh, that one character is always gonna be moving the opposite direction. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you, sort of, mentally get the hang of this, the game becomes a lot easier. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, there is a Bonus Round. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The object is to simply collect hearts for extra points. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Notice an appearance by the whale from "Challenger" here, as a power-up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hudson Soft would occasionally re-use their graphics. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, this game has a finite number of levels that eventually just repeat. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's}, not a bad little game; [it] can get quite challenging. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It is sometimes, sort of, difficult to wrap your head around the concept of moving two characters at once (but going in opposite directions). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, you also have to, sort of, keep an eye on the left-hand side [of] the screen and the right-hand side [of] the screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I find that I would normally die when I was trying to, like, kill a spider or something on one side and was not watching what was going on, on the other side. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} definitely worth playing this game, at least for a little bit. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Bomberman 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 19 🇯🇵 // 1989 01 [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The second game Hudson Soft released on January 21st, is a port of their 1983 Computer game, "Bomberman". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's right, this is the very first "Bomberman" game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, as I mentioned, this is a port of a game originally released for a variety of Japanese Computers (probably, most notably, the M.S.X.). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The game looked quite a bit different in its original version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We'll take a look at that here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You might notice Bomberman looks quite a bit different. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He appears to be some guy wearing a pork pie hat and suspenders. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's [only] one kind of enemy in the original "Bomberman" - some sort of pink balloon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game is actually quite a bit more simple than the FamiCom version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {A} number of features (various power-ups and whatnot) were added. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing about the original M.S.X. version is it does have a very cool death animation for Bomberman himself, as you'll see here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In reworking the game for the FamiCom, Hudson reused one [of] the character designs from "Lode Runner". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, Bomberman is supposed to be a robot, as opposed to a guy who works in demolitions. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, 'Bomberman' is an enormously popular series and, of course, lasted for many, many years - and I guess it's still around in some form or another, even though the last 'Bomberman' game was not very well-received. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But this game is actually a little bit different than what you might be used to. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most surprisingly, this is [only] a single-player game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There is no multi-player option for this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The goal [of] the game is to, well, use your bombs to blow up all the enemies, first of all. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then, use your bombs to uncover the door and exit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Along the way, you can find various power-ups. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game's a little unusual, in that the first levels are actually probably the hardest because you're so, uh -- your ability to blow up things is so limited. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can [only] drop one bomb at a time; the explosion is quite small. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And there are actually quite a few things to, uh, uncover before ya finally find the door. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In, uh, Round 1 there, I almost ran out of time before I found that you could [only] blow up so many -- so many walls with your limited bombing power. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, if you keep blowing things up, you'll eventually find power-ups that increase the bomb radius, that will allow you to drop two bombs at once. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As your blast radius increases, you'll find it's much easier to kill enemies, since ya don't have to get so close to them to set a bomb. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing about this game is, when you first turn it on, it doesn't really seem that exciting. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, the more ya play, the better it gets. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I really think finding some power-ups actually makes the game quite a bit more enjoyable. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You can really, sort of, start doing things you'd normally associate with "Bomberman", like setting off huge chains of explosions and whatnot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I think that, sort of, this game is actually, uh, ya know, really, kind of, worth sticking around for. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One... -- Once you've kind of gotten a few power-ups, the game becomes much more playable. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Altogether, I believe there [are] 50 levels in [the] FamiCom version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] also numerous hidden bonus point-type things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah, there's a fireball that will increase my radius. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} explosions are getting quite big now. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another very cool thing you'll find [a little] later is a detonator that'll allow you to set bombs and then blow them up, one at a time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This'll allow you to set traps for the monsters and kill them [in] much more entertaining ways. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As a rule, the monsters tend to get a bit more difficult, as you go along. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, they [can] do things like walk directly through walls. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, as you get more [and] more firepower, you also stand a chance of blowing yourself up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this is actually a [pretty] decent game - perhaps not [as] exciting as, uh, the later games in this series, but certainly worth playing! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Lot Lot 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 21 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Irem
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tokuma Shoten 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game with no introductory music is "Lot Lot" by Tokuma Shoten. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They are one of those enormous media conglomerates that publish magazines, and anime, and cartoons, and so on, so forth; and occasionally they make video games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is their first game for the FamiCom and it's actually a port of their 1985 Arcade game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, the Arcade game, I believe, was actually originally licensed to Irem, even though I don't think they had anything to [do] -- to do with the development of either the Arcade game or this FamiCom port. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] simple game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... How it works is this: You control the pink arrow, and then the green arrow [will] actually follow exactly along the path of the pink arrow - [only] with a few seconds' delay. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, where ya move your red arrow, the [green arrow] -- arrow will be following right behind it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When you press the button, the contents of the two cells the arrows are pointing to will be switched. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The object is to get the balls to fall into the slots that [are] worth some points. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 What you don't want to do is have any balls fall down into the slot that says, 'Out'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this is a [pretty] interesting and simple idea for a Puzzle game, and it's a fun little game! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can certainly play it for a little while [and] it interests you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... It's not too terribly exciting, and after a while -- I mean, it's hard to imagine, you know, becoming, like, a huge fan [of] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Kinda like "Binary Land", it has, sort of, like, a weird, uh, control system that takes a little while to get used to. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've gotten the hang of it, the game isn't really that hard. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The grid never really changes anything. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah, there ya [could] see what happens when ya get some balls in the, uh, 'Out' bin - a little crab, starts coming up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If he gets all the way up to that red line and snips it, you'll have lost a life - and, of course, you have three lives, as is standard. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, every level, the difficulty increases a little bit more. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Balls start coming through, and the, uh, sides [of] the bin are open for [lesser periods] of time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, there we go; {I'm} about to lose a life. Yep. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, {it's} not a bad little game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... It's fun for a little while. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, it's not too terribly challenging, at least at the earlier levels, and it's, ya know, really not that enthralling either. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Exed Exes 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 21 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Micronics
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tokuma Shoten 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The same day as "Lot Lot", Tokuma Shoten also released "Exed Exes". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly enough, this game is a port of Capcom's 1984 Vertical Shoot-'em-Up! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Why didn't Capcom release this themselves? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They were releasing games for the FamiCom, starting with "1942", earlier. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I really don't know, but for whatever reason, this was, in fact, released by Tokuma Shoten. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the original Arcade version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was one of Capcom's first Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. title to this was "Savage Bees", and all your enemies in this are actually of the insect variety. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You can see some nice parallax scrolling there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, this graphical feature was dropped for the FamiCom release, which wasn't capable of those sorts of things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade "Exed Exes" was a nice little Shoot-'em-Up - not a huge hit like "1942". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, we see the Bonus Screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hitting on the little 'Pow' icon will change all the, uh, enemies on the screen to fruit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is, sort of, the, uh, high-point Bonus Round, here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, this game was (just like "1942") ported by Micronics - and, again, their lack of technical ability certainly shows. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One nice feature about this game (still not incredibly common for Shoot-'em-Ups) is that there are Bosses every level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya need to shoot out all the skulls and orbs of light to blow this thing up. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game also has a number of features which were also in "1942", for example, various power-ups... 🍊🍓 (I think I got an extra life, right there, not to mention 5,000 points.) 🍇🍊 -- various power-ups, [such as] Double Shot, the, uh, little 'Pow' thing which we saw (which will destroy all the enemies on the screen). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's actually not a bad little game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, we have that windmill thing that appears in various Capcom games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is actually a sub-Boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yes, this game does feature sub-Bosses, right before ya get to the great big Boss. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I would classify this as a fun, unique, unusual Shooter. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The whole insect/bee thing makes it different than your average Shooter; that's for sure. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It plays [pretty] well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... It certainly could be worse. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Certainly, it could be a lot better if the porting had been handled by someone more competent than Micronics. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, ya know, the actual game design [pretty] much copies it almost exactly from the Arcade, so not too much harm has been done. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Compared to some [of] the older, more repetitive-style Shooters we've been seeing on the FamiCom, this game is actually, ya know, [pretty] darn entertaining, all things considered. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I'd say definitely give this one a shot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's, uh, one [of] the very earliest titles in the great Shoot-'em-Up revolution that was occurring around 1984 to 1985, and it still remains quite playable! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Penguin Kun Wars 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 25 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Home Data
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the last game of 1985 is "Penguin Kun Wars". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 First of all, note this game lets ya enter in your name when ya first start playing - something not seen too frequently, so far. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is a port of a 1985 Arcade Game, originally by UPL - {the} same folks who made "Ninja-kun..." ({I} guess they liked things with the word 'Kun' in the title). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this game involves some kind of sports tournament against various mammals, in which the object [of] the game is to shoot balls to th... -- your opponent's side of the table. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Every time a ball comes by, you can grab it {and} throw it off. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The object is to get all 10 balls on your opponent's side, as you can see there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you can't get all the balls over there, uh, before the timer runs out, when the timer runs out, whoever has the fewest balls on their side [of] the table will win. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing, of course, that makes the game interesting is that when you get hit by a ball (or when you hit your opponent), you will temporarily, uh, be knocked over and be unable to move. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This, of course, is a good opportunity to keep pelting the other guy with the balls. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, this can happen to you, as well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is both a Single-Player and a 2-Player game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The 2-Player version is probably a bit more fun, though in the later stages (and there really aren't a whole lot of stages - I think maybe, what? four or five?) the, uh -- the computer opponents can actually get quite -- quite fast and quite tricky. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've, uh, won a set (that's, uh, ya have to win two games in a row or two out of three) there's this, like, a little Bonus Round here that, uh, you can't win or lose; you simply play for points, and you move on to the next level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've gotten all the way to the top, you will, uh, have won the championship, and it starts over again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, as ya can see, it's a [pretty] fun, simple, [relatively] g... -- [addicting] little game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game can get quite tricky, especially in the later levels, uh, playing against the computer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When the, uh, computer opponents get quite fast, one thing that can happen is you can be doing fine (maybe you're even ahead a little bit), uh, you get hit by one ball, {it} knocks you over - you're paralyzed, and then he keeps pummeling you with balls over and over and over again, and you actually can't move. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And before you know it, uh, he's got all ten balls over on your side. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Sometimes] even, like, one little mistake like that can, uh, lose you the entire round, later in the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The balls will often start speeding up a little bit, um, in the later rounds, as well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, there ya have it - nothing to get too excited about, but definitely some fun can be had playing this game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to 1986 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 We now enter 1986 - the fourth year the FamiCom has been in existence. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This year starts out slowly enough, with [only] three original titles being released in January and February, but the pace will pick up [pretty] quickly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Soon, we'll see games for the FamiCom coming out at a furious rate! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While the first three years [only] produced around 97 games, 1986 will produce a total of 120 games for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That works out to a new game about every three days. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 What does this mean? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it means we're gonna see a lot [of] games that really aren't that good (even more so than {in} the past). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, a few classic franchises will be created in 1986 as well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, as games get larger and more intricate, they tend to rely more on text. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the case [of] the FamiCom, that usually means Japanese text. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While most {of} the games released so far have been playable by a non-Japanese-reading person, that won't really be the case in 1986. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In other words, a lot [of] the games released in the future are gonna be [pretty] much incomprehensible to the average Westerner. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some [of] these games have been fan-translated, but quite a few have not. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, 'Chrontendo' will look at all these games, but we won't be able to make sense out of all of them. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Twin Bee 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 January 04 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the first FamiCom game for 1986 is "Twin Bee". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is a port of Konami's 1985 Arcade game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you may have gathered, this is a Shooter, very much in the "Xevious" mode; it's a Vertical Shooter. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing about "Twin Bee" - it's actually one of the first in a genre that we now call Cute-'em-Ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This genre was popularized by games like "Fantasy Zone", and "Twin Bee" (the Arcade game). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} basically a standard Shoot-'em-Up, [only] instead of shooting aliens and whatnot, you're shooting bizarre yet cute things (like maybe cats with angel wings or flying teacups and saucers or something) - a genre that's more popular in Japan than the U.S. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In "Twin Bee", you have a laser cannon, and you have bombs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Use one button to fire the laser cannon and the second button to throw your bombs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A little target will appear, as you can see there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's actually a little bit harder than "Xevious", because your target [only] appears when you drop a bomb. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's, uh, much easier to miss than it is in "Xevious". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Twin Bee" is probably noted mostly for its rather strange system of power-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, shooting clouds, a little bell will pop out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you collect the bell, you'll get bonus points. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, if you shoot the bell a certain number of times, it'll change color. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once it's changed colors, collecting it will get you a certain power-up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, a blue bell will be a speed increase. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another interesting thing about "Twin Bee" is it had actually a cooperative 2-Player mode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Still unusual, you could actually join your two ships together, and that would increase your firepower - as well as, of course, play separately. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom version carries this over. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game (even though it looks [rather] cute and almost, sort of, like it might be for kids) is actually [pretty] difficult, as far as these early Shooters go. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can get a number of power-ups, such as the Spread Shot that you see there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Most {of} the power-ups, though, come not from things that you bomb, but rather from collecting bells. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this can actually make the game a bit annoying at times. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We have, uh, one [of] the Bosses coming up, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] six levels altogether; each one has a distinct Boss. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But about the power-ups - as I mentioned, if you hit them, they'll change, uh, eventually to a certain color. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But it's really kind of hard to fight enemies and keep hitting a bell and keep it from dropping off the screen while you're waiting for it {to} change a certain color. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then, of course, once it is the color that you want, you can't shoot it again without it changing back to silver (which is strictly points). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And you have to be careful. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The first color it changes is generally blue. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you get too many power increases, it'll make the game very hard to play, simply because your ship is going so fast. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Starting at around Level 3, this game actually does get [pretty] fast and [pretty] hectic. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... As you may have noticed, the enemies move a lot faster than enemies in games like "Xevious", for example. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A lot of early Shooters seem to, sort of, be, uh, a little on the fast-paced side. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There are various other nice little touches. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, if ya take a shot to the arms, you'll lose the arms - and therefore not be able to throw bombs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Luckily for you, the first time this happens, uh, on any given life, a little ambulance will come and, uh, replace your arms for you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} second time p... -- it happens, you're, uh, simply out of luck. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game actually looks [pretty] good on the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I think, sort of, the, uh, bright color scheme and, sort of, simple graphics really help a lot. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, I'd say this is probably one [of] the better Shoot-'em-Ups we've seen for the FamiCom, so far. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom had been cursed [with] a [lot] of terrible Shooters in its early years, but this one is really not one [of] 'em. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's actually a [pretty] good game (a lot better than "Geimos"), so I would definitely recommend giving it a shot. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Son Son 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 February 08 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Micronics
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Only] three original games were released in February of 1986, and the first of them is "Son Son". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a port of Capcom's 1984 Arcade game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the original Arcade game, here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You play the character of, uh, Son Son, which is apparently, in fact, based on Sun Wukong, the character from the 16th Century Chinese novel, "Journey to the West". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The novel is quite long and complicated, but [suffice] to say it involves Sun Wukong (the Monkey King) journeying to India, in order to find some sacred Buddhist scriptures. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Along the way, he's accompanied by various other folks, including, uh, the pig character, who is the second player character in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game does feature {a} 2-Player cooperative mode. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade game was not the most graphically advanced-looking game at the time, so the FamiCom version actually captures it [pretty] accurately. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game is usually described as a side-scrolling Platformer, but it's really nothing at all like the kind of game you might think of, such as "...Mario Bros.". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Basically, you can, sort of, run up and [down] on these various, uh, platforms here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Enemies come out towards you; they tend to, uh, sort of, try to jump to the same level that you're on and hit you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The character, Sun Wukong, is armed with some sort of staff, though in this game, you just, sort of, fire little bull... -- little bullets. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, you'll come across these little scenes where ya have to break the blocks and destroy (the, uh, well, the wizards or whatever these are) these guys shooting fireballs at you (all the while, still being harassed by regular enemies). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This occurs (oh, I don't know) perhaps four or five times throughout the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And occasionally, you'll come across these Boss-like characters. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They're not actually difficult to defeat, so I don't know that we can really call them Bosses - but these large, uh, floating giants do appear from time to time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If this game doesn't seem as cool as a lot of other Capcom titles, well, keep in mind this is actually Capcom's second Arcade release. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, how's the FamiCom version fare? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, I certainly hope you like lots of sprite flicker because this game has it - in spades. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was (unfortunately!) once again, converted by Micronics - a company that tends to, uh, put out games with lots of, uh, slow down, sprite flicker, etc. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 (Here's those Boss-like creatures I was tellin' you about.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, throughout the game, you'll find little distance markers, uh, starting with, {I} think, '19'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, we're on the very final level - Number '1'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is actually the end [of] the game, right here; we finally get that scroll. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, this game is extremely repetitive. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's mostly just the exact same thing over and over again, with slight variations on the enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} not the most exciting game in the world, and the extremely bad conversion makes this game, well, not quite unplayable, but probably as close to unplayable as you can actually get. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The flicker is so bad, you often can't really tell how many enemies that [are] on the same level with you, because they're constantly blinking back and forth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You don't know if you've shot someone or if they've just, uh, started flickering out for a second. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the repetitive nature of this game and the *serious* technical issues means I *cannot* recommend it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 Launching the Family Computer Disk System in Japan ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 If the early months of 1986 seem sort of slow, well, Nintendo did have one very big card up its sleeve. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 On February 21st, they released a new add-on for the FamiCom, the FamiCom Disk System. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The F.D.S. played games on small floppy disk-like disks rather than the more expensive cartridges. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 An adapter for the F.D.S. plugged directly into the cartridge slot of your FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The F.D.S. certainly had some advantages over the old cartridge system. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 First of all, the disks were rewritable, so games could be saved. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, these were quite a lot cheaper to manufacture, and they had comparatively low retail costs, as compared to the regular FamiCom cartridges. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, "...Zelda" on disk cost around ¥2400. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most FamiCom cartridges cost around ¥4500. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Or, if a gamer was even more frugal, stores would have disk-writing machines that would allow you to write a new game onto an old disk. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You could also buy blank disks. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, this makes collecting used F.D.S. disks a bit more difficult. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You never know, for sure, what game is actually gonna be on the disk, [until] ya put it into your machine. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Though it was never released in the United States, in Japan the system was quite [popular] - selling around 2 million units the first year. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, the system peaked in popularity [pretty] quickly, and by around 1989, [the] number of games released was starting to tail off. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On the launch date, a total of seven titles were released - one new title and then six reissues of some [of] Nintendo's more [popular] games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, believe it or not, "Golf" and "Mahjong" were among the biggest-selling games on the FamiCom, at that time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Altogether, there were around 200 titles released for this system. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The quality really varies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's absolute classics like "...Zelda" and "Metroid". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then there's a lot of games that are, sort of, cheaply and quickly made by off-the-wall developers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It really is a mixed bunch. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, without further ado, we'll take a look at the first one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Zelda no Densetsu: The Hyrule Fantasy 🇯🇵 // The Legend of Zelda 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 February 21 🇯🇵 // 1987 August 22 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As we turn on the FamiCom Disk System hardware, here, we'll load up the first original game for the F.D.S., "Zelda no Densetsu: The Hyrule Fantasy" (or, as we call [it] in the United States, "{The} Legend of Zelda"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's another highly effective Koji Kondo theme song, there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, if you were Shigeru Miyamoto, after having created "Super Mario Bros." (one [of] the most influential games of all time) you would probably go and take a little vacation. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But {that's} not the case with Miyamoto; he immediately went on to release "...Legend of Zelda" a mere four months after "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Granted, "...Zelda" was in development for some time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In the Japanese introduction, here, notice the plot detail is actually given in English, and all the titles [of] the items are listed both in English and Japanese. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, one [of] the advantages of the F.D.S. is the ability to save games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The first thing you do here is create a profile, save the profile, and then you can save and load games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Notice that there are somewhat long load times for the F.D.S.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was a disk-based system, unlike the cartridge where everything loaded up instantly. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another advantage of the F.D.S. was its larger storage capacity than cartridges. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This would allow games to be, uh, much longer, take up much more space, and be, uh, much more sophisticated than previous games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And a game like "...Zelda" really needed some sort of method of saving the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Whereas you could play "Super Mario Bros." in one sitting, that really wasn't possible for "...Zelda" (at least while [you were] still learning the game). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting to think that both '...Mario...' and '...Zelda' (probably Nintendo's two [biggest] franchises) were released so close to each other. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, when the game actually loads, it sort of plops you down in [the middle] of nowhere, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] first thing you'll need [to] do is to get some sort of weapon because you start off with absolutely nothing at all. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game was released about a year and a half later, in 1987, in the United States on a cartridge. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, of course, is the, uh, more comm[only]-known U.S. version. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, you also needed to be able to save. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The cartridge version actually used a, uh -- a battery save pack inside the cartridge. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was certainly a much better way to save than the, uh -- the password system, which was sometimes utilized on long games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, as the game begins, you can simply start wandering around and exploring at your will. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing to realize is that "...Zelda" more or less created a brand new genre. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But genres don't just spring out of nowhere; this game did have predecessors. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Many of the elements in "...Zelda" were taken from other games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "...Zelda" was massively influential, in that [there] was really nothing quite like it on the system, but it didn't spring full-grown out of Miyamoto's head. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Miyamoto likes to talk about how {the} game was inspired by his exploring caves in his childhood. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, while this very well may be true, definitely "...Zelda" did borrow things from earlier games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "...Zelda" is very similar in plot to "...Tower of Druaga". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And a surprising amount of the imagery from "...Zelda" has some sort of antecedent in "...Druaga" (for example, these little wizards that, uh, spit out balls of fire - and the little knights that roam around, their swords sticking out). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Many of the items that you find in "...Zelda" (swords, magic wands, shields, rings, candles, books) also existed in "...Druaga". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Challenger", which we've seen already, has a very similar, sort of, 'overworld with dungeons'-type, uh, layout to it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, Role Playing Games were starting to become popular in Japan, as well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's a 1985 Role Playing Game for the M.S.X., called "Hydlide". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, the layout [of] the game is very similar to "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You, sort of, have a -- a large overworld with various dungeons to explore {and} little monsters, uh, running around the countryside. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You kill them by running into them (very much like "...Zelda"!). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing "...Zelda" had {that} these three games didn't was shops where ya could buy items (either items to improve your character or some items that were required to advance the plot). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 While "...Zelda" is not a Role Playing Game, really, it does borrow a lot of ideas from Role Playing Games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, we find just one [of] the many, many hidden areas that you can find, after obtaining the blue candle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, this will [not] -- won't actually do anything for you until you get another item (a letter) a little [bit] later in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the object [of] the game is, sort of, wander around on the overworld, until you encounter, uh, the nine dungeons that are scattered throughout the land. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the very first one, right here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Every dungeon is, uh, full of interconnected rooms, and -- which are full of monsters. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can eventually get a map. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Keys are often necessary to open the various [doors], throughout the dungeon. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once inside the dungeon, you need to de... -- find and defeat the Boss and then obtain another piece of the TriForce, which is this triangular-shaped doohickey the '...Zelda' games all revolve around. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] *plot* of "...Zelda" (for those who don't know it) is that the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, has been kidnapped by some sort of evil creature named Ganon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Link needs to travel around the world, find the various pieces of the TriForce, and then use it to defeat Ganon - and, of course, rescue the Princess. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the very first Boss right here; he's actually [pretty] simple. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While "...Zelda" doesn't feature character levels or stats or anything like that, there are ways that you'll be constantly improving your character. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, the little heart containers that [are] found after each Boss will increase your Life Bar. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, in order to complete the game, you [will] need to find various objects that [are] hidden in the dungeons as well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, once you find the life raft you can use it to cross the river and get to this dungeon. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another concept that "...Zelda" borrows from R.P.G.s is that monsters will drop items when you kill them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It could be money (known as, uh, Rupees in the game's currency), monsters can drop inventory items, uh, they can drop healing items (that'll refill your Life Bar). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes they'll drop things ya need to progress in the game (like keys). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One concept that other games (like "Challenger" and whatnot) didn't have was the idea of money. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Monsters drop, uh, jewels, which you can then use to buy things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes [the] things in shops are items that will improve your character. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Other things are plot devices necessary to actually finish the game (such as the Monster Bait). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Just like "...Tower of Druaga", "...Zelda" has a lot of secrets. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, you need to push that little, uh, space open, in order to get into the Boss level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And there's a lot of optional ones as well (uh, ways of getting, uh, free money, items, better swords, and so on, and so forth). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These -- This concept, along with that of the shops, would become [pretty], uh, frequent in video games in the very near future. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It really can't be overstated that this game was massively successful, both in Japan and the United States, and had an enormous influence on later generations of games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The number of "...Zelda" clones released in Japan is actually quite staggering. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, we'll see, uh, how to find a hidden sword. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] actually the, uh -- the best sword in the game (the so-called Magical Sword). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And that, of course, is another concept that was somewhat new to "...Zelda" - that of exploration. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game was not at all linear; there was actually a, uh, a certain order to the dungeons that you should probably go through them in. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But you could [pretty] much wander around the overworld as you wished, as long as you were... -- weren't getting killed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, this idea was, uh, ya know, borrowed from R.P.G.s, like "Hydlide", but really kind of reached its, uh, zenith in "...Legend of Zelda". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's one [of] the many hidden underground passages you'll need to discover, while playing the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, while this game does have a lot of secret items, it's not nearly as sadistic as something like "...Tower of Druaga". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's much, much, much more playable than that game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In both Japan and the West, "...Zelda" came with a rather large booklet that explained the items, the monsters, and even, sort of, like, a beginning walkthrough for the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That way, players would not be completely lost. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 A lot [of] the items have special uses. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, the bow and arrow is used to kill these monsters; that's the [only] way they can be killed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Monsters tend to have different weaknesses in "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can't just use your sword on all of them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "...Zelda" is, in many ways, sort of a giant puzzle, which you have to figure out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the game itself gives you many hints (uh, not all of which are [particularly] helpful). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing this game introduced was the, uh, mysterious character [who] gives you some sort of hint but can [only] say exactly one thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And that one thing is often, uh, not as clear as you would like it to be. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The game is full {of} these little, uh, helpful guys who re... -- absolutely refuse to explain themselves. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 All these different things, sort of, add up to "...Zelda" being an early attempt at a totally immersive game - a game that would feel, not just like you're playing a video game, but rather you're sort of inside a little world - this even more so than "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Whereas "...Mario..." is very linear, "...Zelda" is not. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can [pretty] much roam around, as you'd like (just like a U.S. Computer R.P.G.). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Miyamoto [called] this concept, sort of, like, having your own little miniature garden. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Much [of] the fun [of] the game is wandering around and making discoveries. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One [of] the things you'll need to discover is the, uh, location [of] the final dungeon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's, sort of, hidden away in the very corner [of] the world. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to plant a bomb in order to, uh, find the door. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly enough, bombs feature quite prominently in this game, which is kind of strange because "Bomberman" and "...Goonies" were released right around the same time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's a little bit of a spoiler alert; we'll actually see the final, uh, level, the Final Boss, and the end [of] the game, right here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! There is Ganon (um... perhaps a bit disappointing). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He doesn't actually move; he's just a variety of, uh, static sprites. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You will actually need to have found a special item (a Silver Arrow) before you can actually defeat Ganon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It can be somewhat difficult to find. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The final dungeon is actually quite large (around, uh, 50 squares). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing about "...Zelda" is the overall size [of] the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, uh, "Hydlide" had a sort of, very similar layout but was [only] five by five squares (for a total of 25). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I believe the overworld of "...Zelda" has around 150 different screens. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And there's also, uh, at least that in the various dungeons, as well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "...Zelda" was a very lengthy game, and, of course, you actually do a lot of backtracking and moving around the overworld on this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The actual dungeons are spread out all over the place. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you will often find yourself sorta having to cross the overworld many, many times. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 By today's standards, this might be considered a flaw. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We seem [to] prefer games where you're, sort of, constantly moving forward, rather {than} hav... -- uh -- having to, uh, backtrack over the same territory, over and over again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, here we have the closing cutscene. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "...Zelda" actually had a -- an actual ending. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Not all games did, though, of course, ya know, in the style of games of the 1980s, once you're done, you actually get to play again. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Just like "Super Mario Bros.", there's a *second*, uh, adventure, which is actually a bit more difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And "...Zelda" may have been one [of] the very first games to have credits at the end! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 'Miahon' was actually, uh, Miyamoto's nickname. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's an alternate reading of the Japanese characters in his name. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Using pseudonyms or nicknames in the credits seemed to be, uh, [pretty] common in Japanese games, at this time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, in conclusion, "...Legend of Zelda" is a great game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It takes things from all sorts of game genres (Action, Adventure, R.P.G.s, Puzzle Games), mixes them all together in a totally consistent way, and is something that (at the time) gamers found new, fresh, and exciting and to this day remains to be a very playable game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Goonies 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 February 21 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Released the same day that the FamiCom Disk System debuted, was Konami's "...Goonies", based on the 1985 Richard Donner film. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is the first FamiCom ba... -- game based on a movie. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It certainly wouldn't be the last because movie and TV tie-ins would become quite common on this system. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The movie "...Goonies" concerns a ragtag group of kids who descend into a cave, looking for some hidden pirate's treasure, while dodging a criminal family called the [Fratellis]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game, while it does feature characters from the movie, is a little different. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The object is to find all the kidnapped Goonies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You play Mikey (the character portrayed by Sean Aston in the movie), though you look exactly the same as the other Goonies in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You navigate through six different levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game ends when you find the pirate ship and rescue the last Goonie, Andy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is very much a Platformer, in the style of "Spelunker" or something like that (though, of course, it's much better than "Spelunker"). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In order to complete a level, you'll need to find all the keys that [are] hidden in the safes, scattered around the level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Those are [the] little doors with the skull on them.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In order to bust into a safe, you'll need to, first of all, collect a bomb. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Be careful when setting bombs because it's quite easy to blow yourself up, just like in "Bomberman". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You collect the bombs by killing the rats that roam the stages. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You could [only] hold one bomb at a time, so you'll need to get a bomb, set it off, then kill another rat. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Other things that are hidden inside the safes (other than just the keys) are, uh, the kidnapped Goonies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, there's some sort of power-up inside a safe, or there's, uh, potions that will refill your Life Bar. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's actually quite a few items to be found in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can actually see them up there on the top [of] the screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like, right now I [only] have bombs, but you can also get various kinds of armor (special kinds of armor that [will] protect you from fire or water). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] get a slingshot that will allow you to attack from a distance, rather than just the, uh, kung-fu kick that's your default. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 At any rate, once you have all the keys necessary, you head to the end [of] the level and, uh, go through the door. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then you're on to the next level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This first level is quite short, but the later levels are actually much longer and much more complicated. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's also a number of hidden items to be found. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Every level has, like, a unique, uh, keypad operation that you put in that will cause a hidden item to appear - if you're in the right spot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, right there, we got Konami Man for some bonus points. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now ya can see the little jewels appearing; uh, collecting enough of those will refill your Life Bar. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, this game was actually not released for the N.E.S. in the United States. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was released in Arcades in one [of] the Play Choice 10 machines. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I actually remember playing this game in a grocery store or something, when I was young. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, uh, the second game, "...Goonies II", was released for the -- the, uh -- the N.E.S., and is probably a bit more well-known than this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a real shame because this is actually a very good Platformer! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Compared to a lot of the stuff we've seen on the FamiCom (like, say, "Challenger", or "Spelunker") I mean, this game is actually really very well-made! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It controls well, it's challenging, uh, there's a lot [of] things you can explore. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is really a game that *should* have been released on the N.E.S.! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They certainly released much worse; that's for sure! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure if this game was successful in Japan or not. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It may have been somewhat overshadowed by "...Legend of Zelda" and the release [of] the FamiCom Disk System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But if you're looking for some old-school Platforming fun, this game is highly recommended. 🍇🍌

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 March 06 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Soft Pro 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The next game for the FamiCom was also by Konami, though it was actually developed by a company called Soft Pro. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a port of the 1984 Arcade game, "Circus Charlie". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We'll look at the Arcade version, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And in 1984, uh, even by, ya know, the standards of that particular time, this game was [pretty] simple. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, the FamiCom version looks an awful lot like the Arcade version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The colors aren't quite as good, [and] the graphics aren't *quite* as detailed, but it's -- it's [pretty] faithful. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is certainly a change of pace from "...Zelda" and "The Goonies". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's hard to imagine a game any more simple than this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It mostly just involves jumping over stuff. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game was -- almost seems to be, perhaps, uh, designed with kids in mind - with its, sort of, ya know, cute little circus theme and very simple gameplay. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It does actually get a bit trickier in the later levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Once you, sort of, get used to the fact that you cannot control your player at all in mid-jump, it's not really that difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So it's, uh -- I would hesitate to call this a bad game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's well-designed and controls [pretty] well, but it's -- it's so simple that, uh, you may or may not actually enjoy playing it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another sort of old-fashioned feature: it actually has a B Mode, which is a slightly more difficult mode. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Circus Charlie" is certainly a well-designed game, but in the face of stuff like "Super Mario Bros." and "...Legend of Zelda", it s... -- almost seems ridiculously, uh, old-fashioned. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gyrodine 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 March 13 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our final three games will all be Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the first, "Gyrodine". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is a port of a 1985 Arcade game, designed by a company called Crux but actually manufactured by Taito. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Taito is also the one who apparently ported this to the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, we see the original Arcade version - quite a bit more graphical detail. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Notice nice little touches, like the shadow underneath your vehicle, there - a lot of texture. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, for the FamiCom port this was graphically downgraded quite a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's ver... -- really very little texture on the backgrounds (no shadow, nothing like that). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now] this game is a Vertical Shoot-'em-Up, more or less in the style of "Xevious". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe it's, sort of, halfway between "Xevious" and "Tiger-Heli". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is a lot slower-moving than some [of] the other Shooters we've been seeing on the FamiCom, recently (rather methodically paced). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have (uh, just like in "Xevious") two types of weapons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a air-to-surface weapon - not really quite bombs; they look more like air-to-surface missiles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you have air-to-air weapons, as well, which [you] use {to} take out the various flying enemies you come [across]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, if you hit both buttons at once, you'll fire some sort of cruise missile, like ya saw there for a second. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, it's, uh, I haven't really been able to find mo... -- much use for the cruise missile. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Mostly just, sort of, uh -- You can control it a little bit, but mostly it sort of swerves right past your enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Gyrodine" falls into the general category that a lot [of] Shoot-'em-Ups do for the FamiCom in this era - neither very bad nor very good. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This does seem quite a bit like "Xevious". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You, sort of, fly past a bunch of forests, rivers, {and} eventually, you'll come across little bases. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There's no real levels, no real Bosses (that I've come [across]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Mostly ya just, sort of, uh, fly and blow things up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Often, there'll be little brief pauses of inactivity, and then a new enemy will start showing up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some [of] these can be, uh, a little annoying (like, for example, these, uh, cruise missiles here that fly past you at incredible speed). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, that's really all there is to say about "Gyrodine". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... For fans of Vertical Shooters, it's certainly not a bad game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, there were much more exciting Shooters coming out in the Arcades, at this time. 🍇🍌

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, as you can see on the credits, the game was actually designed by a company called T&E Soft - {a} Japanese company, known mostly for their Golf Games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Hydlide" (assuming that's how it's pronounced) is a very interesting game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Notice I didn't say it's a good game (because it's not), but it is probably about the first R.P.G. ever released in Japan - originally for the M.S.X. in 1985. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can see the M.S.X. version, here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Yes, this game was, I suppose, officially the beginning of the console R.P.G. genre. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Not that I would recommend that anyone who's into R.P.G.s play this game because it's notoriously bad. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it's often considered (like several other games we've discussed recently) to be one [of] the worst games ever released for the FamiCom or N.E.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Why this was released in the U.S. (in 1989, no less) is anybody's guess. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Hydlide" is an Action R.P.G., meaning it's not turn-based; you actually fight monsters by running into them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, go very far, and you'll run into monsters [that] will instantly kill you (like that zombie, there). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When you first play the game, it's probably best to stick to the little blue slimes that, ya know, are runnin' around the area immediately where ya first start off. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Almost anything else will kill you instantly. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Like a lot of Japanese R.P.G.s, this game seems mostly based around [Leveling] -- Leveling Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, you have very little Life, very little Strength, {and} very little Magic when you first start. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Killing one monster will move up your Experience one little tiny notch. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once the Experience Bar fills all the way up, your Life will go up, and your Strength will go up, and your Magic will go up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you see here, I just hit Level 2. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, it takes about 100 monsters to Level Up one level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the way this game plays, it's actually quite tedious. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya need to use your button to switch between Defend mode and Attack mode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya don't see any visual change, there, but when he's in Attack, he'll actually [be] able to kill a monster. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {In} Defend you won't take as much damage, but you'll do almost no offense (at least in your early levels). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a very little menu, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... One thing you *can* do is t... -- a temporary save file. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It would be quite impossible to actually play this game without this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Notice it doesn't actually save the game after you turn off your -- your machine. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have to use passwords if you wanna start a new session. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But you can s--, uh, put a temporary save file that'll allow you to, uh, restart from where you saved, if you, uh, died without turning off your machine. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There are some very small dungeons, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most dungeons are about this size (usually about two screens). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the actual in... -- overworld is quite small - [only] five screens by five screens. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Therefore, there's a total of 25 screens, plus a few extra screens for dungeons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I think there's maybe three dungeons in the entire game? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game certainly looks a lot like "...Tower of Druaga" - at least superficially. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it takes a few pages out [of] the books of, uh, 'Ultima' as well - especially "Ultima III", which was, sort of, *the* R.P.G. -- the Computer R.P.G., at this time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The object of {the} game is to collect three fairies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} turns out a Princess was somehow split into three fairies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! We just found Fairy 2, there, hidden in tha... -- that little moving tree. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Your object is to find all three and then go to the, uh, dungeon and kill the b... -- the demon that turned her into fairies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've collected all three, uh, you can go down there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, there's, sort of, various little objects you have to collect. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, {to} def... -- defeat the vampire in {the} beginning [of] the game ya have to get a cross; ya have to get various - oh, jewels, keys, {and} that sort of thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's [only] maybe ten objects in the entire game, including one sword (that'll [upgrade] your offensive capabilities), one shield, a ring (that'll make you heal a bit faster). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But the game is very simple. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's really not a lot of object collecting - um, just mostly items that need -- are needed to advance the plot. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You do have magic spells you can use (Turn, Fire, Ice, Wave, and Flash), but they're [pretty] much useless in most situations. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [only] really have to use them a couple times. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most [of] your time is spent simply bumping into monsters. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... One thing about this game that makes {it} a little frustrating... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Ah, here we have, sort of, like, a little mini-Boss here.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ...you have to kill those two guys -- those two magicians. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But unfortunately, we have to kill them using the Wave magic - and you have to hit them both with the Wave, at the same time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Only] hitting one won't do the job; it's quite frustrating, as most [of] the Boss battles are in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is somewhat of an exercise in frustration. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When you hit monsters, you tend {to} take a little [bit of] damage yourself, especially, uh, if you hit them, sort of, at the wrong angle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This means your Life Bar is, sort of, constantly decreasing, as you play the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And you have no -- no Life magic, no healing items. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your Life heals up automatically if you stand on the, uh, the overworld. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It also heals very, very slowly, as you can probably see by watching the Life Bar. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, when you defeat dangerous monsters like this (even though I'm [pretty] much completely Leveled Up), I do -- I do take quite a bit of damage every time I touch him, and actually do very little damage. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, fighting a Boss like this is basically a matter of running up, touching him, running back, waiting for your Life Bar to, uh, level up a little bit, and then just repeat over and over and over again until finally, bit by bit, you get his halth -- health down to nothing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's really very little strategy or skill required in most [of] the battles; it's really more of a matter of patience than anything else. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, I've got the medicine (the [only] healing item in the game). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It can only] be used once, so you wanna use it during the Boss battle. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Before ya fight the Boss, you have to get one last remaining item, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! I got a Luby! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Hydlide" is definitely what we'd call a historically important game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, it was [pretty] much the first-ever Japanese R.P.G., and it's [pretty] primitive, [as] you can see. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But it is also quite unplayable. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Only] the most masochistic R.P.G.er could actually sit down and play this game all the way through. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it's not very long, if you know what you're doing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's very little hints given. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... There's really not much along the lines of dialogue (no helpful old men, like in "...Zelda", {to} sort of, give you any kinda idea of what to do). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You, sort of, run around and hit things until you find something and, um, just, sort of, explore around the relatively small world, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I'm sure very few [people] will actually want to do this themselves. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'll actually show you the ending of the game after you defeated the final demon, there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] three fairies appear, and they magically materialize back into the Princess. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then that's it - absolutely nothing! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Congratulations! You just played a rather boring game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Honestly, about 75% of this game will be Leveling Up, fighting the same monsters over and over and over and over again. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, about 10% will be waiting for your Health Bar to increase. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [then the] remaining percent will simply [be] wandering around, looking for stuff. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The massive amount of repetitious [Leveling] Up action and then the frustration of getting killed frequently really make this game a real drag to play. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 MagMax 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 March 19 🇯🇵 // 1988 10 [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nichibutsu
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nichibutsu 🇯🇵 // FCI 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, here's something a little different. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's "MagMax", a port of Nichibutsu's 1985 Arcade game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the original Arcade game, right here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, it's a three-quarters view, uh, Shooter that actually switches back and forth between this kind of view and a straight, uh, side-on view, if you go underground. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's a} nice little game, and, uh, the Arcade, uh, version's [pretty] nice. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the FamiCom actually, uh, looks [pretty] decent as well; it has the same little intro, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the game actually plays quite a bit like the Arcade version. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is Nichibutsu's first FamiCom [game]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They had a few Arcade hits back in the '80s, [such as] "Crazy Climber" and "Terra Cresta". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They were never a huge player, however. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Nowadays, I believe, they make, uh, Mahjong Games (and, of course, that, uh, popular Japanese genre, porno Mahjong Games). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game is (um, believe it or not) yet another game in which your ship can transform into a giant robot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, unlike all those other terrible games, this one is actually [pretty] good. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You collect the pieces, one by one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, there's the legs. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, lo and behold, changing into [a robot] actually does something useful; ya can fire off more shots. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In a lot [of] the other robot Shooters, uh, your Robot Form is actually [pretty] useless, other than making you larger and easy to hit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this game, it's actually quite convenient - not [only] for the eh, uh, extended firepower, but also the -- for the fact that each time you get hit, you'll [only] lose one part. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You won't actually die until you're reduced down [to] your, uh -- your, uh, regular ship there, as you just saw. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's several different levels, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... This one is the underwater level, apparently (probably the -- visually the, uh, least interesting of all the levels). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 At various points, you can actually, sort of, choose your path. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya can either go underground, or ya can go back up to [the] surface. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I personally k--, sort of, prefer the underground scenes because I like the side view, uh, a [little] better than [the] three-quarters view. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Three-quarters view can actually be a bit trickier to hit things because you might think you're hitting them, but actually, your shot is going right behind them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The underwater sequence is probably the most difficult, as you have all those little, uh, holes there that kind of suck you into them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the, uh, Final Boss, a three-headed dragon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} actually a [pretty] cool-looking Boss, for a Shooter of this vintage. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "MagMax" is [not a] particularly hard game, but it's actually quite [a bit] better than your average "Formation Z"-style Shooter, like we're seeing on the FamiCom, at this time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the Boss doesn't really blow up or anything; he just sorta shuts down. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've gotten past this last level, here, the, uh, whole thing basically starts again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah, now, we're back into the, uh, same field [that] we started at. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, {it's} definitely a [pretty] good game and worth trying out. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Baltron 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 March 19 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bear's
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toei Animation 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A good rule of thumb for the FamiCom releases during this era is that one thing you can always count on is games about ninjas and Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game, "Baltron", is a [pretty] generic Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is the debut from yet another company tryin' to cash in on the popularity of the FamiCom - Toei Animation. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They are a ridiculously prolific animation studio, maybe nowadays best known for the 'Dragon Ball Z' cartoons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Back in the '80s, they also did stuff like the 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' and 'G.I. Joe' and that sort of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They've been around for quite some time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game was actually developed by [an] obscure little company called Bear's that I don't really know anything about. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And if you pop this thing in {and} you start playing it, the first thing that'll enter your mind is, uh, 'Hey, wait a second; this game looks exactly like "Defender"!'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And that's really all it is - is just a rather mediocre "Defender" clone. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I played this game for a little while, wondering if, ya know, I was actually missing something or if there really is -- all there is to this game is just, 'fly through the air {and} just shoot stuff'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... There don't appear to be any levels, or Bosses, or anything; [this was] obviously made very quickly and very cheaply. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... What's the purpose of this game existing? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I [guess] it's just, uh, to get product on the shelves (no other reason). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is definitely the least interesting title that we've covered this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But it's actually not bad; it's just mediocre and has no reason to exist. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, don't worry. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Next episode, we'll be back, looking at some really awful games again. 🍇🍌
