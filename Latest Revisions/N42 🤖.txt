👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 42 ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Hey folks, welcome back! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Chrontendo Episode <FORTY-TWO::42>" picks up in February <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once again, rather than covering <fifteen::15> games, we're going to cover the entire month - <seventeen::17> games altogether. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Four of these will be games released for the U.S. market in February, including the return of L.J.N.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's also a few R.P.G.s, Kiddie Games, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So let's get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tom Sawyer no Bouken 🇯🇵 // Adventures of Tom Sawyer 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 06 🇯🇵 // 1989 August [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Winkysoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Seta 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's February <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> and we have "Tom Sawyer no Bouken" from Seta "feet eyes" fame or infamy it might be. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Just last episode, I was marveling at how in Japan classic novels get made into video games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And now we have this, which is based on Mark Twain's famous novel from <EIGHTEEN-SEVENTY-SIX::1876>... sort of. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, I guess not really. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the intro, we see Tom falling asleep in class. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess that's happened to all of us at some point or another. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once he drifts off, the game begins. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So this is, sort of, one of those cop out dream games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Rather than picking bits from the novel the whole thing takes place in a dream so basically said it can just fill up with a standard video game elements, and it's still technically a 'Tom Sawyer' game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game was developed by Winkysoft, another Japanese developer with a terrible name. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the first level, Tom is cruising along on a raft, which fits in with the setting of the novel, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In some ways like a lame Shoot-'em-Up level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now surprisingly set released this in the U.S. as "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The title screen intro are actually almost identical with one little exception. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The animation of Tom falling asleep is gone when he appears here he's already asleep. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So we fire game stage one and... 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Whoa! What the heck is this crap? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Jumping over barrels. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then seagulls attack you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And when Tom gets hit, he explodes into a cloud of smoke. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well, Seta made some changes to the game, mostly by rearranging the levels. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Instead of starting off with the rafting level, it starts off on the pirate ship level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As you can see, Tom Sawyer is incredibly primitive looking side-scrolling Platformer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's very rudimentary. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Throw Roxette your enemies duel jumping and ladder climbing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Enemies tend to move very quickly and appear unexpectedly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it's quite easy to die until you have the whole thing memorized. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And after kind of best to be, sort of, constantly throwing rocks just in case an enemy appears off the sidelines. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It feels, sort of, unfair and vaguely like the first Transformers game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's a [pretty] good example here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Come across some boxes, and hey, that guy just appeared on top of me. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 That enormous rat is some sort of mini-Boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Tom Sawyer is a [pretty] cool, [pretty] terrible looking game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Check out the stationary fish in the ocean. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And for some reason, the pirate ship has flying octopus is hovering around. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, not to be a pedantic dick here but the plural of octopus is octopus is not occupy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Don't confuse an octopus and a cactus. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The boss is a giant octopus, who's actually very easy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Touching him doesn't harm you. Though the little octopuses will do some demo they'll kill you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is like one of those one hit kill kind of games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But you just stand there and shoot rocks in his eyes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Why is the final boss of the pirate ship a giant octopus. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, it shouldn't be like the pirate boss or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 After this, but then go on to the river level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here you shoot logs, jump over low land bridges in the river. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have this really stupid looking slow motion jump. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A little bit later down the river you'll find people shooting at you and whirlpools. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now you may have noticed that when you shoot an enemy, often a little t icon will appear. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you collect enough of those you'll get an extra life. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, sometimes a school icon will appear and if you actually touch one of those will lose all your T icons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This box is way more irritating than the octopus. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a huge alligator I guess it can [only] be harmed when you shoot the top two fangs on top of his mouth. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You actually need to wait till he opened his mouth and lab a shop between his lower to front So that it hits the upper front teeth. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's actually incredibly irksome and as far as I can tell, it's basically just pure luck. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So Tom Sawyer is mostly just plain old, kusoge. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's really visually displeasing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It has lame boring level design and stupid loving unfair enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So I guess so far "...Episode <FORTY-TWO::42>" is off to a really great start. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Wagyan Land 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 09 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Now Production 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, here's a very unusual game from Namco "Wagyan Land". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Whoa! What the hell? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We're suddenly playing Super Mario World. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Let's take a look at that again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That is a [pretty] cool World Map thing, sort of, ahead of its time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So login land is visually speaking a lot different looking the most any other FamiCom name we've seen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's got all these very simple shapes, clean lines, flat colors. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I know that sounds like just about every FamiCom game, but again, land does have like this very minimalistic approach that makes it look [pretty] appealing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now we actually have an English translation here from Elon Midas. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now, you might say this doesn't look like it needs to translate. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I mean, there's no words. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it actually does come in extremely handy later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So the story behind Wiggin land is, sort of, weird. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As far as I can tell, the character was first introduced like a mechanical Arcade Game of some sorts from Namco. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The emotional weapon logon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and the game is called login land, but the character is just Oregon for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At any rate, Namco created this character in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987> or so and then finally, an ad released a video game starring him. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Wagon has some sort of emotional shouting attack that stuns enemies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can jump on them while they're stunned. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Picking up the wagon icers (those fun little wagon figures) will increase your power of your son attack, make it a bit larger and also stun is longer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now once you picked up for walking icers you will get temporary and vulnerability. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However you still need to be very careful around the game its enemies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Enemies, no matter how tiny and harmless they look, are all of the one hit death variety unless they are stunned. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now wuogon must go down in history is one of the wealthiest Video Game Heroes ever. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Little tiny dancing mushrooms, snails, even worms all cause him to lose a life. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 After a little while you'll reach a boss and this is where the game gets kind of weird. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Instead of like the typical boss battle you get to challenge to a word game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A deadly word game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first kind is the word A. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Bunch of cards here, one is picked. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then you have to pick another card that starts with the same letter that the previous card ended with. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 For example, mouse. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You need a word now that begins with an E. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there are a few elbow here, AIG and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, this is where the English translation is needed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And even though it is translated into English, it is [pretty] hard. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And actually, this translation job is [pretty] impressive. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean house when actually what about translating this? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I really don't know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, you have to keep getting the right answers until you were the boss out and will quit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Or more accurately, he'll die. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yes, it's a word chain battle to the death. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The other type of boss battle is the memory game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now I'm sure you've played this before he had turnover a card and then you try to find the matching card. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your requires a good memory or maybe save states. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Either one will work. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But it does seem like the computer cheats. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you're doing well, the other guy will suddenly get like a whole bunch of bright really lucky guesses in a row. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh yeah, I love this boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He's like a medic robot with a jackhammer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I suppose that accordion land has one major flaw it's the boss battles. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, the word chain in particular can be very frustrating. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But note that many pitchers have multiple words attached to them, like here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Can't find anything that starts with a K. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We'll click on the octopus squid thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oh, it's cracking. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's a bit of a stretch. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, who'd ever guessed that unless you speak one of those dramatic languages where that's what the animal is actually called. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And the level design can be creative at times. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This level is actually a series of slides and jumps. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can pick up quite a bit of speed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it might remind you just a little tiny bit of like the Sonic the Hedgehog games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still, we really can't consider Wiggin land to be some sort of loss classic. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, it's a cute game and relatively slick, but it doesn't really go to greatness. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Parts are very easy and boring, just walking around and avoiding slow moving Emmys, and then you encounter a really frustrating moment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One thing I hate are these springboards. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a few of these and in some it's really easy to fall short for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I felt my death a few times on one springboard in the last level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now there is some sort of plot develops, believe it or not. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Walk on reaches Old Village, which appears to be empty. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He does often encounter this old man who seriously upgrade his weapon with the super wagon ater. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now once you have this, you can shout out a deadly Wave Beam that will [pretty] much allow you to just, sort of, plow your way through enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Near the end of the game will even find these weird bonus levels. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Before too long, you'll discover that it came that the walk on people were kidnapped by someone called Dr. Devil. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The last couple levels of lead to his layer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There is a somewhat tricky section where you need to move upward into the sky by jumping on clouds. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Since you can't see very far above you it's really easy to reach a dead end, so to speak. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Finally reached the last level which is most like a lot of jumping at the very end you encounter Dr. Devil, who is a rather smug looking bastard who resembles Dr. Wily. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But Lord is that guy rocking some tight pants. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And he has an unusually prominent package or a video game character. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, really, that guy's pants are [pretty] much obscene. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Then Dr. Devil challenges you to a memory card game, and then a word chain game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Unfortunately, I am very sad report that I really can't show you the ending because I could not win the final battle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The memory game is played that bad, but the word chain is very long and impossible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I kept getting stuck in unwinnable situations where I checked every single card and none started with a letter I needed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I restarted the battle multiple times, but every single time it would just end with me getting stuck. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't know if this is an issue in the original Japanese version, or just the translated one but it's a shame. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So again, like is an interesting but very flawed game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Let's hope Namco was able to produce a better sequel. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sekiryuou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February <TEN::10> 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, here's a game from Sunsoft "Sekiryuou". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Their last Japanese game was monkey note adventure. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This one's also an Adventure Game Based on a manga. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Like Wissing and "Chrontendo ... <FORTY-ONE::41>" Adventure Games were just huge and non-stop bowl in Japan at this point. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I like this rather dramatic opening here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For our purposes is probably the most interesting part of game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The title means literally Red Dragon King, though the actual transliteration kind of confuses me. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The word red or the character but as far as I can tell is normally written or spelled as aka. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But every single time I see this game written out and Roman characters, it's sexy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So why it's pronounced too sexy in this case, as opposed to aka, I really have no idea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, it's Based on a manga by a guy called Hiroshi moto Mia. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This seems [pretty] obscure, at least outside Japan. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It concerns a period of unrest and Chinese history between the chin and the Han dynasties. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Of course, when one dynasty ends and another begins, you'll often find some kind of civil war on rest or something like that going on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Went away what can I say about this game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, it's another Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You walk around, talk to people move around from location to location. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm getting, sort of, tired of these. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm not really sure how many more I can Hey, before I crack. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At least this one has nice clean look looking graphics. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't know for sure if it wasn't developed internally at Sunsoft or was handed out to somebody else but I guess the end result looks reasonably nice. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Yamamura Misa Suspense: Kyouto Hana no Misshitsu Satsujin Jiken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose | Disco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 For those of you playing along at home, you might have noticed on February <TENTH::10th>, there was another game released aside from "Seki wio". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was the second disc of Data East latest '10 page in Gucci suburu' game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But we already covered that way back in "...Episode <THIRTY-EIGHT::38>" when the first disc came out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So moving along to February <ELEVEN::11> we have another Murder Mystery Adventure Game yamamura Misa suspense Kyoto ohana Nomi, she to set Susan Jagan from Taito and Tose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You know how last episode I had mentioned the Nishimura key Otaru game and it was the second FamiCom game based on the work of a popular mystery novelist. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, the very first touch game was the first ever more mystery suspense game covered back in "Chrontendo ... <TWENTY-SIX::26>" - the episode with "Final Fantasy" and "Mega Man". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the first game had, like, a Kyoto theme and so does this one - cherry blossoms right off the bat - and a guy gets poisoned. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When people get poisoned, they always drop the cup or whatever and then there's like a shot of the poisoned drink spilling out onto the ground. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 No one ever puts the cup down first, then dies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess that would be less dramatic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So once again there's cherry blossoms everywhere and dead body. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And need to solve the murder with the help of your [pretty] blonde asst. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Those of you with exceptional memories, we'll call that the plumber and Mrs. Ben's games use a graphical interface with little picture icons instead of the standard written That works. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The ears for talk center someone pointed out way back then. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The word Kiku means both listen and talk.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Of course, when you talk, the other person talks back, so I guess that makes sense in a way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One nice touch the icons vary depending on the context, you'll [only] see the useful icons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When there is something to pick up, the hand icon appears. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When you can move to another location, the foot icon appears and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It seems most other Adventure Games that use icons have a static bar. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I guess the dynamic action bar is a bit of an advancement. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first game had a static bar as I recall. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So once again, this is a [pretty] slick title, especially from Tose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I feel like they are slowly but surely making more appealing games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We were actually going to have a couple more Tose games later this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Q*bert 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Gottlieb | Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Ultra 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's time to check out February's EOS games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We've got four games this time released specially for the U.S. market, starting with "Q*bert" from ultra games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And <TEN::10> of America [only] allowed five games per year from any one publisher back then. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But Konami was able to release more games, since they had a secondary imprint ultra games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The [only] other publisher to do this was Acclaim when they bought Lj n. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But I think Konami and claim are on [pretty] good terms with Nintendo of America, so they sometimes got some special treatment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, Cuba is a port of the <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-TWO::1982> hit Arcade Game, originally from Godley. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One unusual feature is the ability to customize the control scheme. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You hardly ever saw this back then. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Of course, keyboard is, sort of, awkward to play using it D-Pad so I suppose the customizable controls makes sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 All assume everyone watching this is at least somewhat familiar with keyboard. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The original was one of the most successful Arcade Games of the early <NINETEEN-EIGHTIES::1980s>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was noted for its unique gameplay. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When the arcades were full of space Shooters and Maze Games, this really stuck out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, when he had died, the speech synthesizer produced some geometry sounds, which the speech bubble indicated was "Q*bert" cussing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Back then that was considered to be [pretty] funny. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Various homeports came out the Atari <TWENTY-SIX::2600>, the <FIFTY-TWO::5200>, Colecovision, Commodore <SIXTY-FOUR::64>, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 None of these were completely satisfactory. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I suppose the Nintendo version was actually the best one or at least up to this point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the object is simply to change every block to the correct color by jumping on it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can jump in the four diagonal directions. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can't jump straight left or right to the directly next to you for some reason. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now this presents a bit of a problem with the controls. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's recommended you actually turn the controller <FORTY-FIVE::45> degrees so that the D-Pad buttons correspond to the direction that keyboard actually can move. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But you know, after years of holding the Nintendo controller a certain way, you don't just change things up and expect your brain to play along. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I found myself accidentally jumping the wrong direction many times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 With a bit of practice, this will get easier, I'm sure, but "Q*bert" is much better playing the Arcade with a joystick. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the Arcade version also seems to have more responsive controls. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still Kubrick's not bad. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's [pretty] fun. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's definitely a hard game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The enemies move around in unpredictable fashion, so they can be difficult to avoid. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And while this is hardly a perfect port, it's not bad and definitely acceptable by <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> standards. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tecmo Bowl 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 November 30 🇯🇵 // 1989 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tecmo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well, here it is the big game this episode, and perhaps the most well remembered Sports Game on the N.E.S. "Tecmo Bowl". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now this isn't quite a Western owner lease. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It did eventually get released in Japan in late <NINETEEN-NINETY::1990>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, it was clearly designed for the U.S. market. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now you may have seen the NFL players Association logo there. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That is Tecmo has officially licensed the names of the players. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But since Tecmo did not have the actual NFL license, no team names are given. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There was an official NFL Football Game released later in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it is sadly NFL football from ljm a game which is almost entirely forgotten today. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now it seems kind of weird to have the rights to the NFL, as The rights to the NFL players being licensed to separate companies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But that was actually kind of normal back then. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A few years after this, of course, Electronic Arts would acquire both licenses for the mme series where they store main day. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Like so many other technical games, this was originally found in arcades. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It came out in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>, and had a dual screen setup. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As far as I know, it didn't make much of an impression at the time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is, sort of, the same deal as "Ninja Gaiden". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Arcade versions almost forgotten today, whereas the home version is considered to be a classic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now there's a theory among video game aficionado shows that the less realistic a Sports Game is, the more fun is to play. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this theory explains why techno ball is so great. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's [pretty] simple in terms of the controls and the various options you have for plays and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Tecmo Bowl" definitely goes down the ease of use path. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is the complete opposite approach of the 'Madden' Football series. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You might remember, we just saw the first 'Madden' game in the <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> Computer Round-Up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first 'Madden' game would let you control virtually every aspect of the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You could make custom playbooks; you could even change the weather. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Tecmo Bowl" has none of that. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are [only] four players to choose from. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Grant and the plays vary a bit from team to team, but you have two passing and two running plays able for any given team. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here I've chosen the run option. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You just hand the ball to running back and away you go. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I have Walter Payton here as you can see up at the top of the screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Like I said, everything is very simplified. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are no fumbles in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once you've got the ball, the [only] way they can stop you is by tackling you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Passes are also very simple. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You control the quarterback at first. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once your receiver is clear, hit the button that throw the ball to him. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Each player has their own set of stats, but really speed seems to be the biggest factor here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The physics are completely unrealistic. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 During a tackle, players go flying all over the place. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Players will often jump way up in the air in order to try to intercept a ball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But all of this just adds to the fun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's hard to pinpoint exactly what makes a tech bubble so great. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess a lot of the little things add up, like the catchy music, or the easy-to-use controls. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, you can just pick them up into about how to play the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not something like Skate or Die, where you have this horrendous, complicated control scheme that changed depending on what you're doing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And the game seems really balanced. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There aren't any no fair moments. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 All in all, it's another great achievement for Tecmo and a huge improvement over technical Baseball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It really stands up with the classic Sports Games like "Super Dodgeball", or "Blades of Steel", or "Double Dribble". 🍇🍌

🤖🍊🍓 Our next game is "Bandai Golf Pebble Beach Challenge". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You think with all the Golf Games that came out in Japan, we'd see a localization of one of those games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But no, Bandai released a brand new game just for the U.S. market, developed by... 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Anybody want to take a guess? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 ...Well, who else but Tose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I say this is a brand new game and but really, it's just like every other FamiCom Golf Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If there's any difference, it's probably the, sort of, confusing display and controls. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like, for example, why are they like their two flashing dots here? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess it's to constantly remind you that it's player ones turn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now selecting course allows you to go view the layout of this particular hole. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And it gives you like a weird looking side view along with the more common top-down viewpoint. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Of course, institution clubs, adjust the cursor to indicate the direction that you want to hit the ball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And of course, to hit the ball, you perform the now standard three button press maneuver. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Every single Golf Game we've seen has used this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I really don't need to explain it by this point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As you probably figured out, this takes place on Pebble Beach, the famous Golf course located on a spectacular stretch of the California coastline near Monterey. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you're not familiar with the area, well, it's really beautiful and expensive and like Clint Eastwood hangs out there. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there's a very famous cypress tree. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I suppose basing the course on Pebble Beach was the [only] reason this game was created, as opposed to just releasing like an English version of a Japanese game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now there are a few eccentricity is like it, it's really hard to get the ball to drop in the hole sometimes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you put it too hard it'll like always bounce out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But for the most part, it's really just like every other <EIGHT::8>-bit Golf Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Friday the 13th 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atlus | ? 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by LJN 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, let's get this one out of the way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here's today's most infamous game "Friday the <THIRTEENTH::13th>" from L.J.N.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At least this intro is [pretty] cool. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And augment I think the music is not that bad, though it is simple and repetitive. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We've heard way way worse. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Friday the <THIRTEENTH::13th>" sometimes makes those worst ns game lists. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I agree this is not really a fantastic video game, but it's not really that bad either. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The art music or professional looking, the interface isn't too confusing or awkward, and the gameplay is a little obnoxious. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There was also a "Friday the <THIRTEENTH::13th>" Computer Game, but this one is completely different. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So you have six cows there's scattered throughout the camp, and you start by picking one. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Each has different steps. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is, sort of, like "Maniac Mansion", I guess. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though in this case, all but two of the counselors are [pretty] worthless. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also, once a counselor dies, they're gone permanently. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And you don't have to pick one of the remaining ones. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So when you start out the game, we walk outside and get attacked by zombies, which seems kind of weird because there were no zombies in the movies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can throw rocks, but these will sail over the zombies heads unless you kneel down. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, seriously, how hard is it a zombie with a rock? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 What is killing the zombies do? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, not much really. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're mostly just distractions. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They do drop items or weapons occasionally. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One of the things you can do while running around Crystal Lake is enter the houses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These houses are mostly empty. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sometimes there'll be a note inside. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A few have fireplaces, which you can use to light a fire if you have like the one time use lighter in your inventory. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some Kevin's have another counselor or the kids see minutes in the upper left corner. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So other than running around going in houses, what's the purpose of this game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, it's not a game like "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There is no end to the level, nor are there even oil levels. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have a series of pathways that sort of loop around in a circle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 No, the object is to kill Jason. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, how do you kill him? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, you need to defeat him in combat three times. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first two times you defeat him, he returns the next day more powerful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So why can't just walk up Jason and kill him? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Because he tends to appear in random places and then disappears after a certain amount of damage. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He then need to find them again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Every so often the game warns you that Jason has been spotted and the timer starts counting down. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You then need to look at the map and then hustle the hell over to the location where Jason is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Take too long and he'll start killing the kids. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 When you reach the cabin where Jason is you have like a little battle with him. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this is where the game starts getting sketchy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first time you try to fight Jason you'll probably get killed really quickly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's because the fighting mechanics work [pretty] much like no other video game ever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's tricky but when Jason approaches you need to hit down on the D-Pad and then either left or right to clean and avoid his blow. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you just put a move to the left or right without hitting down first, you won't be quick enough and you'll get hit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, the game manual doesn't really tell you how to play this maneuver. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And mastering this is the [only] way you can possibly try the pipe with Jason. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Then, of course, you attack Jason when he's not too close to you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And eventually you'll shave off a couple bars and this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Helps me split and if you run outside, you can often find Jason on the road and fight him again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Then just basically keep repeating this until you've worn down His Life Bar. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Then the next day it starts again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Everything is exactly the same [only] now Jason is faster and tougher. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Aside from finding Jason pick up items such as potions to store a teeny tiny bit of health, or lighters, or better weapons like the knife. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The knife will just occasionally just appear. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But for better weapons like the machete or the torch you have to like either get lucky and find the random drop or go out of your way to find out by doing like some kind of weird sequence of events, like lighting all the fireplaces. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Or you into a cave and Jason's mother, who is a flying decapitated head. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, I wandered around the cave quite a bit and couldn't actually find her. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's kind of hard to tell your way around because all the screens kind of look the same. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There's a bit of mystery over who built this game, though Game Developer Research Institute has dug up a bit of information. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like the other Lj and releases of the era, Atlas was responsible for producing the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, Atlas subcontracted titles out to other developers like sauna week soon westone. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It is known that the music was contracted out and probably the programming was as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The structure of Friday <THIRTEENTH::13th> reminds me a lot of L dragons "Jaws" game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Both are relatively nonlinear game, which is a freely move around on a small overworld. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You have one major boss enemy Jaws, or Jason, who we randomly encounter while running around In the world. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Most of the time is spent moving around from location to location, try to obtain items to make you more powerful to kill the boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And both games can be completed quite quickly if you know what you're doing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There really aren't very many other games like this on the FamiCom Ernie is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The fact that "Friday the <THIRTEENTH::13th>" just still, sort of, weird and different confusing and the fact of mechanics are hard to master, cause a lot of people to really hate this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, there's very little variety. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The same zombies appear over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Anyways, we're walking around a circle past the same scenery again and again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's [pretty] repetitive! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still requires a certain amount of experimentation and fooling around in order to figure out how to kill Jason. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And that does appeal to some folks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, most people are not going to like this game, myself included. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 FamiCom Jump Eiyuu Retsuden 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, we're back to Japanese releases. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's another one from Bandai on February <FIFTEEN::15>, FamiCom "FamiCom Jump Eiyuu Retsuden", once again, the belt by Tose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess at this point toes had become the most prolific developer for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's four games episode - that we that we know of. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When's the last time we even saw Nintendo built game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At this point, as far as I'm concerned, the FamiCom is a toasters console. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're the one making all the games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We look at this title school in English for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is the old kid reading the book somehow it gets sucked into the alternate reality inside the book thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Same idea used for commies old Action R.P.G. "Esper Dream", and I get, sort of, similar to "Action <FIFTY-TWO::52>" I suppose? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well, anyway, FamiCom jump is a joint project between Bandai and the comic magazine shown in junk. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Weekly shown in Jump has been around since the late <SIXTIES::'60s> and hundreds of successful wrongest series originally their. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Dragon Ball pit to the North Star "Captain Tsubasa" High School came in Guney City Hunter kinnikuman - everything! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nowadays I guess Naruto would be the most well-known show the jump series. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The idea behind FamiCom jump isn't a feature is like an all star cast of characters magazine. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it's, sort of, like Bandai is version of "Wai Wai World" - the Konami All Stars game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Ever as good as that sounds, in theory, FamiCom jump is a [pretty] clunky Action R.P.G. thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's your main character there. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Moves very slowly most of the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As you wander around, you'll see enemies visible in the overworld. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you get too close, you may be forced to fight them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this is where the game gets ugly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Engaged in these little doodles where you duke it out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These guys with mustard stashes will fire projectiles out of their fists, which is [pretty] annoying. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So basically like Bob and leave and have weather bullets while trying to shoot them with your weapon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Frequently the two bolts will actually hit each other in midair. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The other ones don't seem to have good weapons and will just try to punch you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And for some reason, they seem to have abnormally large fists. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Along the way, you'll encounter tougher enemies and have like these like boss fight type things here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Again, this is done by having two teeny tiny sprites run around on the screen trying to hit each other. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Whatever the merits of this game might be, the battle mechanics seem far too annoying to play this very long. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Naturally, you will eventually come across some towns with shops. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This looks like it's straight out of the 'Fist of the North Star'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You also need to hunt down the other party numbers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here's the first one I found Nuka Saku Ida from my Humor comic calm suit, a nice tone to knockin. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I can [only] hope that as you get new allies with new abilities, the battles become less annoying. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So FamiCom jump - it's, sort of, an interesting idea. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But Tose and Bandai haven't had much luck with this, sort of, game so far. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess a good Action R.P.G. is really hard to make. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe the sequel will do that. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Space Shadow 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I'd say that from a purely aesthetic perspective, this is the best part of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so what we have here is "Space Shadow" from Bandai again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this is a Light Gun Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It seems like we haven't really seen a whole A lot of Light Gun Games on the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Men in the U.S., of course, stuff like Duck Hunt was very popular but in Japan apparently not so much. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However, this is a bit different since Bandai created a [pretty] amazing looking Light Gun called the hyper shot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It basically looks like a machine gun - like an Uzi or something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Space Shadow" was the game that came packaged with the hyper shot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The [only] question is, 'if you went through all the trouble to upgrading a Light Gun this cool-looking, why would you package it was a terrible game?'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Unless I'm drastically misunderstanding this game it's team "Space Shadow" is about the most elementary repetitive Light Gun Game you can possibly imagine. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You walk down the corridors, and in every section, one enemy appears. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You shoot the enemy over and over until it dies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He didn't go on to the next screen and repeat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The enemies attack you by throwing something that looks like a kidney. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Space Shadow", I guess is very influenced by the movie "Alien". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I guess the thing they throw was supposed to be like a baby alien like a face hugger or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, after about eight screens or so of this, you have a boss battle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this is the same thing [only] with a bigger alien. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And man, these bosses take forever to kill. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Really, these things just go on and on and on! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is not one of those games where you die because it's difficult. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You die because you get so bored and frustrated, your attention starts to waver. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And eventually you just like stop caring if you get hit or not. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You just want it to be over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If I was going to give you guys a hint for playing "Space Shadow", I'd say 'Don't do it!'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But aside from that, savior grenades for the boss battles, they make them go by a bit faster. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now maybe I'm doing something wrong. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe they're like certainly weak spot you're supposed to be attacking. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I really can't tell. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Light Gun Games as a genre tend to be sort of repetitive, but this is got to be about the most boring one I've ever seen. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Roger Rabbit 🇯🇵 // Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 16 🇯🇵 // 1989 August [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Kemco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There were a couple FamiCom Disk System games released in February. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The system is still putting along, though just barely. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 By mid-1989 the [only] major publishers to still be releasing new F.D.S. games will be Nintendo themselves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So "Roger Rabbit" is a Kemco game based on the <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> movie that combined the live action animated characters. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The movie was produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin production company and Disney Studios. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The credit show the programming is being by kotobuki (that is, chemical themselves). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, "Roger Rabbit", the game is based very loosely on the film, and by that I mean not at all. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's really just a loaded runner type game, with sprites that look like characters from the movie. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The object is to collect the various heart sounds scattered on the level why avoiding these loot suited bad guys? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's the weird thing despite being a rabbit, Roger cannot jump nor run. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 His main method of vertical transportation is climbing stairs, which is quite unusual for a rabbit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The doorways that you see are stairways that allow you to move up one floor. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now Roger is even more helpless and lower guys they can't dig holes or anything protect themselves from his pursuers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Luckily, the game is way easier than "Lode Runner", which had some really difficult tricky puzzles on it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, "Lode Runner" was actually quite sadistic if you recall some of the load or games that we've seen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now at this point, you might say, Hmm, I know I played this game before under a different name. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yet you see in August of <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> chemical released the game in the U.S. as "Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle" - the exact same game would be as bright. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Be hard to replace with carrots and Warner Brothers characters such as Sylvester Wiley, coyote, Yosemite Sam, are put in as the enemies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This must have been because ljm had the U.S. video game rights for "Roger Rabbit". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And they released a completely different "Roger Rabbit" game around the same time that crazy castle came out in the U.S. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So the game itself is none too exciting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are <sixty::60> levels, none of which are really that complicated or difficult. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later levels have different themes like plumbing tubes instead of doorways and that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You'll often find special items, like a one time use of boxing love that you can use to kill one enemy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Use it to get cornered or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is the first game in what's usually referred to as a crazy castle series. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is a confusing sort of series of games, which are notable because they almost always feature different characters in Japan than in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In Japan, the MCO had the right for the Disney characters, and most of the games featured Mickey Mouse. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the U.S. and European versions of the same Japanese Games started Bugs Bunny, the Ghostbusters, Garfield and an original character called kid clown. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And these are most released for the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But Bugs Bunny did appear in a couple of the later Japanese games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the last game had Woody Woodpecker so it's actually quite strange using. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once you complete the final level, you'll get a closing screen of bugs of some female rabbit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Thrilling not very exciting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though "Roger Rabbit" the original game had a better ending. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You get this little animated cutscene of Roger rescuing Jessica. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I suppose the presence of Jessica Rabbit makes the ending a bit sexier. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Why wouldn't like call this game cuz so Bay or anything it is a [pretty] simple Puzzle Platformer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there's nothing really wrong with that. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But just like chemicals Donald Duck or Snoopy game that we saw earlier there's really nothing special about it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hydlide <THREE::3> 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 17 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by T&E Soft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now here's a surprising one from Namco, "Hydlide <THREE::3>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now I'm sure you all remember the original "Hydlide" which came out to the FamiCom back in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SIX::1986>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was released by Toshiba EMI in Japan and FCI in the U.S. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And actually, as of February <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, "Hydlide" the first game hadn't even come out in the U.S. yet. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was released over here in June. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first game is [pretty] notorious on the internet... for a couple reasons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It soundtrack greatly resembled the main theme from "Raiders of the Lost Ark". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And also it was an incredibly primitive and frustrating Action R.P.G.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 With "Hydlide <THREE::3>", the series has been dragged kicking and screaming into the modern age, starting with this fancy animated intro. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, you might be wondering what happened to "Hydlide <TWO::2>"? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, the first "Hydlide" came out for Japanese computers in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-FIVE::1985>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The second game was released in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SIX::1986> - also for computers like the M.S.X. and P.C.-88. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For some reason, it never got a console version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Hydlide <THREE::3>" was naturally also originally a Computer Game and came out in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, here is the M.S.X. version. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It did make some concessions to fit in with the popular 'Dragon Quest'-style R.P.G.s in the era. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it's still a [pretty] ugly and awkward experience. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, the FamiCom port was the first of two console versions. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What's going on here is that you're actually choosing a class - you know, fighter, wizard, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And once you start the game, you'll see there are towns, shops, and so on; you can talk to N.P.C.s. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first game has production, none of this stuff. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So "Hydlide <THREE::3>" seems much more like a typical J.R.P.G. of the era. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Then later in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, it received a second port to the Genesis of all things as "Super Hydlide". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Genesis version actually did come out in the U.S., unlike the FamiCom version. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And despite looking, you know, [pretty] awful for a Genesis game, it's still considered to be the best version of "Hydlide <THREE::3>". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So here's the thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm not really going to go into "Hydlide <THREE::3>" in any detail because at some point we'll be covering the superior Genesis version. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though, as you can probably tell by looking at this footage from the beginning of the game (where you find a bunch of living trees), you can probably see this is, sort of, hampered by the same awkward Action R.P.G. battles as the first "Hydlide". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So you're really not missing that much. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Flying Hero 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 17 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Aicom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Epic Records | CBS/Sony Group Inc. 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Wow, what a weird title spraying! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The English and 'Flying' is written out in English for some reason. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And what is this guy, astronaut jet pilot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 No, he's actually a fireman, or rather a trampoline jumping Fire Rescue specialist of some sort. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So remember that game between rescue from the last episode of 'Chronsega'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Came out in July <NINETEEN-EIGHTY::1980> in Japan for the Master System. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, this is really just a heavily altered version of that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You control the trampoline down the bottom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Use it to bounce your firefighter up in the air to the windows, grab folks, and then get them to safety. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And you also use the opportunity to loot the buildings by grabbing things like bags of cash and the occasional special items that'll bring along a rain cloud to put out a fire or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 No "Flying Hero" similarity between rescue is not coincidental. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Both were built by icon, a company whose output has been inconsistent to say the least. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They've made some sort of terrible games like "Amagon", and awesome games like "Legendary x" for the TurboGrafx-16. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later they will go on to new stuff like the amazing looking Shoot-'em-Up posts for the neogeo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Incidently, this "Flying Hero" has no connection to the Super FamiCom Shoot-'em-Up, also-called "Flying Hero", the later "Flying Hero" was developed by Sting, of all people. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So "Flying Hero" is certainly not one of their better efforts. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it's decent, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I would say that the Looney rescue was more fun and look nicer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's [pretty] hard to aim your guy using the trampoline so you just wrote fly around randomly in the air a lot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You also frequently have a falling object on one side of the screen and your firefighter will be on the other side of the screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So there's no way you can catch both the firefighter and the item. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So you tend to miss a lot of the bonus items. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This was published by Epic Sony, Epic being the record company, not the guys who made "Unreal". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I wonder if they knew or cared that Icom was basically just remaking one of their earlier games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Wizardry II: Llylgamyn no Densetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sir-tech | Game Studio 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, here's another one from ASCII - Japanese software publisher that seems to specialize almost exclusively in Computer ports. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the title is a little confusing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The box art identifies it as "Wizardry II: the third scenario, legacy of Llylgamyn". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You might recall ASCII at least a part of the first "Wizardry" back in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And you might think that based on the title "Wizardry II", this is like a port of the second 'Wizardry' game, but no "legacy of low gamma" is actually "Wizardry III" and hence this is titled "The third scenario". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later asked released "Wizardry II: the second scenario: Knight of diamonds", which really was supportive "Wizardry II". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So the question is 'Why did they release "Wizardry III" before "Wizardry II"?'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess we'll never know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the original "Wizardry III" came up for the Apple Computer back in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-THREE::1983>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This one has a relatively fancy little intro describing the plot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But when you fire up the game and play it you'll see it's almost exactly like "Wizardry (I)" and "...II". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And just like to you can't create characters; you need to import them from the previous game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, it is absurdly hard! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 To illustrate R.P.G. addict said in his blog that he had a character die in nine out of the first <TEN::10> battles. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And reviving characters is impossibly expensive early in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He also need to create lots of characters and certain levels cannot be accessed by characters of certain alignments. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The whole thing sounds like a royal pain. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the FamiCom version is not that painful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Obviously, you can create your own characters and human comes with some generic characters pre-created. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The entire game is basically just wandering around and first-person dungeons and then killing stuff for loot and money. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And you better break out the graph paper because you're never going to find a way around that a map. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Every room looks exactly the same. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Expect take a lot of damage, have characters get killed, and never have enough money to heal everyone. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For those of you who have mostly played Japanese R.P.G.s, be aware that healing is actually a lot more difficult in games like "Wizardry". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But in this case, healing requires staying at the end for weeks and weeks, which ages the character and they can eventually die of old age. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now this particular port was built by Game Arts, just like the first one. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Game Arts awesome did the third FamiCom "Wizardry" game, but that one got a U.S. release. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Legacy of Llylgamyn", for some reason did not. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hyakkiyakou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Use 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, we're almost done today People want to go. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Such as this one from the rather obscure use software, or perhaps Isa, if you were to look at Japanese characters. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is "Hyakkiyakou" for the odd, supernatural themed R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a rather lengthy opening sequence here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But let's discuss the name real quick. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A term "Hyakkiyakou" is often translated into English as "the night of the <HUNDRED::100> demons". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That is the night when demons or spirits walk the earth, kind of like the Japanese Halloween. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Japanese do, like, a weird thing for ghosts and demons and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So the Huck Jaco is something that turns up in Japanese fiction art, you know, from time to time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 When I first started doing 'Chrontendo', I assume there are going to be tons and tons of R.P.G.s on the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I suppose there are quite a few, though if you saw that <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> Round-Up last episode, you will know that as a percentage of total games, the R.P.G. wasn't exactly the biggest genre in Japan at the time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was surprising number of these are not what we would call 'Dragon Quest' clones. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There have been a lot of Action R.P.G.s, "Wizardry" clones, and for oddball games like this one. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So there seem to be a lot of these forest maze things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At first, it's hard to distinguish the parts you can walk on from the parts that you can't. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Walking around you'll find enemies just milling about. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Often these can't really be avoided because your maze thingy will actually lead you directly to them and you can't just walk around them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Battles are turn-based and [pretty] standard except for the rather boring looking battle screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are actually quite a few R.P.G.s at this time that don't use random battles. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later, of course, when everyone equated Japanese R.P.G.s with Square games, non-random encounters seem very much out of the ordinary. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But as we've seen, this wasn't always the case. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 FamiCom jump is just one of the many other games where you can see enemies visible on the overworld. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "hook Jaco" also uses what I would call the "ease" style of World Map. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is opposed to the "Ultima" or 'Dragon Quest'-style map where when you exit a town you become like an enormous avatar which walks around on a miniature map. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here are the regular overworld and towns are on the same scale. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Another interesting feature is that your character is more realistically proportioned and the squat childlike characters found in most Japanese R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 All in all, this is a little bit different than most R.P.G.s. at the time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It doesn't seem particularly well-made or very exciting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it does show there was more variety back then and R.P.G.s than you might realize. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tama & Friends: <THREE::3> Choume Dai Bouken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We have a yet another Bandai game, this time on the FamiCom Disk System. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For those keeping track this is Bandai game number four it's episode - four games! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Bandai just never left up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, we don't know if it's taught by Tose or someone else but we do know that it's about a cute little kitty cat, "Tama & Friends: <THREE::3> Choume Dai Bouken". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The '3 Choume' part refers to where Tama lives. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the Japanese address system, many towns have a number followed by 'Choume', which designates a particular district of a town. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 'Tama & Friends' was owned by Sony, and I believe it started life as characters on stationary products. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A little later, there was an animated 'Thomas' series. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The series even aired in the U.S. on cable TV, so it's perhaps a bit less obscure than some of the other kitty T.V. series games we've been seeing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so here we go. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Tama was aimed at young children and I'm [pretty] sure this game was to. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Tama can jump, climb up telephone poles, and walk along walls and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I'm not even really sure what the point of this game is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It seems that you just walk right until you reach the end of the level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You don't get very far before me start moving across the screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Tama can jump on enemies and put them out of commission. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We're getting Hitler draynor Life Bar represented by the hearts on the bottom left of the screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Sight from birds you have like random junk fall on your head. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A lot of Baseballs are flying around and things that I guess are tin cans. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Probably the excessive amount of stuff that falls on you is the most irritating part of this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As mentioned, one thing Tama can do is climb up the telephone poles. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Every once a while this will lead to like a "Super Mario..."-like bonus level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Except in Super Mario, you have like that moving cloud that carried you across the level so it was a bit more... exciting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also, when you get to the end level, it dropped down in the same spot rate climbed up the pole, which doesn't really make much sense from like a geographical perspective. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Like I was saying, I think this is a children's game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And while the simplicity of gameplay makes me think it was designed for the young ones, it's actually a it hard. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Heads moments where you jump and then it comes flying out hits your mid-jump. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 With a bit of dedication you can get through the game but really who can muster up the enthusiasm to get all the way through this thing? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's [pretty] boring! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, here's the first boss, a dog naturally. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One little trick: stand behind them; he won't turn around. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then... more the same damn crap! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 No, I really shouldn't be too hard on "Tama & Friends". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, Bandai has certainly the least worst games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there have been games like they're a lot uglier. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it's not so much terrible as it's just boring. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ganbare Pennant Race! 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Our very last game today and the last game from February is from Konami, "Ganbare Pennant Race!". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 What!? another 'Ganbare Goemon!' game already? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, sort of, but not really. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Ganbare Pennant Race!" is actually a Baseball Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now is this Konami's first Baseball Game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't recall. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, we have the open mode, which is for the one-off games, as well as like the pennant mode, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is for one or two players. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The teams are all silly sounding fictional names, some of which have Konami names like Jairus or Gamal, and ty. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You also get your choice of three stadiums, which is a nice touch. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's odd that "Ganbare Goemon! <TWO::2>" just came out in January and then next month, they are cramming into a Baseball Game, of all things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When you choose the Golden tie team, all the players look like 'Goemon'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess Goemon was, sort of, a Konami mascot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I guess it's really isn't a different than Nintendo putting Mario into a bunch of Sports Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As far as Baseball Games go, this is [pretty] decent. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's really hard to get a good hit and again to the C.P.U.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It seems like every single hit is just like a slow pop fly that gets easily caught by the C.P.U.'s team. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Like it's hard to even hit the ball at all. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I had a lot of strikes in this game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I just couldn't seem to get the timing right. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It always looked like my mouse just passing right through the ball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The C.P.U.'s pitcher is [pretty] tricky and throws a lot of curveballs and go just a little bit outside the batting box. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 When you get a home run, however, you do get this little animation. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The production values are [pretty] high and the music is great. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Seriously, this has just about the best music winning Baseball Game I've heard so far. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Let's take a listen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I don't exactly love this game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When you're pitching the C.P.U. tend to get these powerful line drives over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also, it's really difficult to determine where a highball gonna land while it's still high up in the air. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I missed a lot of fly balls. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Where's this C.P.U. always knows exactly where to stand kept the ball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This gets [pretty] tiresome. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Is gonna repeat race and race game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 No but is a decent Baseball Game that never got a U.S. release for obvious reasons. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 42 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, that finishes up February. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 What next? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, I will try to squeeze all of March into "...Episode <FORTY-THREE::43>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's going to be a lot of games however. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But there will actually be a lot of interesting stuff. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some Arcade boards, a classic N.E.S. port of a U.S. Computer Game, and a Japanese Adventure Game with a really weird title from Chunsoft (the guys behind 'Dragon Quest'), and a another ill-conceived port of a Sega Super Scaler game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well, we'll see ya next time. 🍇🍌
