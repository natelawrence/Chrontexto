👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 30 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I must have been in a really bad mood when doing this episode since long these games really irritated me, including a game that a lot of people really love. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then of course, there are also some indisputably awful games today as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But we also have a lesser known game that is really good, so it all balances out in the end. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's finish up March 1988, and then move on to April. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Olympus no Tatakai 🇯🇵 // Battle of Olympus 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 28 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Infinity 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Wave Jack 🇯🇵 // Brøderbund 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm gonna start this episode off with a healthy dose of vitriol. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a look at our first game, "Olympus no Tatakai", from Imagineer/Wave Jack - a game which is much loved by apparently every on Earth, but me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A couple years later this was released in the U.S. by Brøderbund as "Battle of Olympus". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game rather helpfully gives you a map at the very beginning, or rather, you think it might be helpful first, but actually traveling around the world is done "Castlevania II"-style using interconnected side-scrolling sections. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, for the most part, "Battle of Olympus" is a bog-standard side-scrolling Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You alternate between walking in rooms and talking to N.P.C.s and fighting monsters on the roads connecting your destinations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, the rooms here look very similar to those in "Zelda II..." (to which this is almost always compared to in the United States). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though in some ways it actually is more as more in common with "Castlevania II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of the later levels even look heavily "Castlevania" inspired. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Battle Olympus tends to front load and many of its hints. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is the first part of the game has tons of N.P.C.s tell you about all stuff about staff of this or the Cave of something or another. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because he just started playing he really have no idea what he was talking about, or really what this has anything to do with your quest. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you start encountering your first enemies, they're like regular slimes, except they jump out of trees, and then they crawl on the ground below the reach of your sword. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to kill them when and if they happen to actually jump at you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Every level has a couple of doors that lead to another part of Greece, as well as many doors that lead to other parts of the same area. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this world is constructed with lots of interrupts and side-scrolling passages. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 From the starting area Arcadia you can find doors to Attica or we are here and artists. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Has a rule your sub goal in each area is to find some required magical item or weapon and frequently to speak to the God in a local temple, who will usually give you the necessary magical item. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main purpose is to rescue your girlfriend from Hades. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The story is based very loosely on her Legend of Orpheus and ready to see, though the manual calls from Orpheus and Helene for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Various figures from Greek mythology make appearances. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the whole Ancient Greece theme is more accurately depicted than in "Kid Icarus". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fighting enemies will yield one of two things and all of us is currency in the game, or a bailiff, which will restore one section of your Health Bar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will sometimes need to buy a required item from a god or goddess using all IPS. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you might have to do a bit of, sort of, grinding killing monsters hoping to get those Rare olives. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the first real boss in this game is called lumea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And for a first boss, she is perhaps just a little too tough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 She is constantly firing arrows at you with your magic shield in the flesh If you're standing really far away from her. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Get up close and you'll still get hit or go right through your shield. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you'll need to jump over her arrows, land within about one pixel accuracy in front of her, hit her, then quickly back up before she shoots another arrow. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Being just the tiniest bit off result and either touching her when you land hitting arrow as you're jumping or landing just a teeny bit too far your sword not reaching her and then immediately getting out to the face. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 She's more difficult than any boss and say "Castlevania" or "Mega Man", and this is just the first boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you to feed her and rescue a child she kidnapped you get a reward, which is the staff of Finnell (stronger than your club you start off). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With and what is he gonna say the staff is made out of fennel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How can you make a weapon at afinil. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even otter it shoots fireballs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now once I got to argolis I found these standard enemies to come in increasingly cheap and frustrating, especially the bats which tend to swoop down and hit you on the head average of your sword. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's thing about this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Almost every single enemy is just a little too high or too low to actually hit or is constantly moving up or down or jumping at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Felt like an entire game is full of Medusa head to Igor some "Castlevania". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why are there no enemies that just attack you at sword level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the alt can take multiple hits to kill. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also you have this fire shooting federal staff but thing is incredibly lame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, come on guys, when you give me like a fire weapon, I don't want it to look like this I want to look more like this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This silly little peashooter of fennel staff will not work for me. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the thing is almost everyone in the world love this game But me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When I check out the user reviews on game facts, for example, over half the reviewers rated either nine or 10 out of 10. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess because it's one of the relatively few of these games that were actually released outside of Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is really any better than say "Chester Field". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mean bland backgrounds, sort of, boring level design. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least "Castlevania II" cool castles and Farzana do had much more interesting levels to explore this thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game was built by Imagineer who don't really have a whole lot of impressive work on the resume. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We did a lot of ports, American Computer Games Japanese systems to multiple games, profitless Doom, that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is far and away their most well-known title outside of Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think I finally lost it at the forest level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Screen after screen of identical looking forest with doors, take it more forest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's bats in this level too? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I understand the key level the bat hacking in countries. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I think at this point, that's it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I officially had it with this game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Takeda Shingen 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Another 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hot-B 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Within weeks of the FamiCom version of "Nobunaga's Ambition" hitting the shelves, two very similar games came out, the first of which is "Takeda Shingen" from Hot-B. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I had earlier bemoan just how awful the aim Hot-B was. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And CRV pointed out that was apparently it stands for 'he's over there because' which is maybe even worse than just Hot-B. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, uh, Takeda Shingen he was a real guy, a daimyo, who was a rival to Nobunaga. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The one story surrounding his death was it was killed by a sniper while preparing for an upcoming battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might be familiar with a story from the Akira Kurosawa movie, Kaka mutia, which was inspired by stories about Qaeda, who supposedly asked us impersonators to confuse his enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and, by the way, and Nobunaga his ambition to Qaeda is one of the other playable by meos. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I guess in some ways, this is, sort of, a second video game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this looks [pretty] similar to Kobe's game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the main map screen, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have your various stats and options to improve your feet, raise an army (you know, that sort of thing). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really not that much different than "Nobunaga's Ambition". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the battles however, are handled very differently, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Their turn-based but you control individual soldiers with move and attack options (a bit like night scene). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I put in some footage from the demo mode here in a second choice or what a battle is looks like with no more soldiers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When I was playing this, I didn't actually take the time to, you know, raise a real army. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, here we go, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Incidentally the sequel to this was released in the United States and you can play it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was a lot different than this game and it is total, sort of, lame. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the main question here is how developers get this game on the market so quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can [only] assume that those industry knew that coil was working on a port of Nobunaga and heartbeat managed to get it a game at about the same time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, whenever I see very similar titles all coming out within like weeks or days of each other, it strikes me as being a little odd. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fudo Myouoden 🇯🇵 // Demon Sword 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 29 🇯🇵 // 1990 January [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not bad music here... until that horrible noise comes in during the lightening. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Pages last episode with my little history of Taito I was complaining about titles, lack of good console exclusive games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then along comes "Fudo Myouoden", a.k.a. "Demon Sword", which, sort of, proved my point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now watch as I'm playing this game here and you'll see me die very very quickly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is an original FamiCom title from title that was clearly the spiritual successor to Legend of cago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, of course, title decided to get the very best to make this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right, this was made by Tose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it's not really that bad, once you get the hang of it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As long as you have no problem with entities constantly dropping out of nowhere from every angle possible, the game is playable. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I should point out that the U.S. release of a "Demon Sword" was altered quite a bit from the original. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a look. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps maybe a bit more of impressive intro and music here - very Stark and dramatic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's either fire or the wind is blowing through your red shag carpet. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the game looks, sort of, the same, but there is one big difference however. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Holy cow! no Life Bar? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How does it even possible, you say no one could beat the game like this! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, there is a special power of the enemy's drop in the Japanese version that allows you to take extra hits. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually, I can take two hits right now without losing a life. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The good thing is you can click quite a few of these if you work at it, thus allowing you to potentially take a lot more hits than the U.S. version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now about the name fudo Meeow is a Buddhist deity of swords, generally a scene surrounded by flames carrying a sword and a rope. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He looks like kind of a mean guy, but he actually protected from disaster disease and uses rope to lasso demons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, fighting demons seems to be the main focus of this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the U.S. version again and here's the first boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now important part of the game is to click power-ups by defeating standard enemies (keys to open locked doors, the special magic make boss fights easier). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's a good good idea to like stand around and kill enemies into your stock up on special items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like title and toes us I'd bring grinding into side-scrolling Action Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of the power-ups, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To kind of like you know, Shadow warriors that go behind you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The one when we do multiple throwing stars. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting how much This game resembles the late later 'Ninja Gaiden' games - from some of the power-ups to the actual shape of the demon laid. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway hope I'm doing damage that guy or not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll activate some ninja fire magic here, a couple fireballs, like cool, sort of, circle around you and damage enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, the exact same, sort of, magic appeared in one of the 'Ninja Gaiden' games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now for the U.S. release, the game was simplified quite a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some levels were cut out and a number of power-ups was greatly reduced. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the Japanese version again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a look at all the extra power-ups we have, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoa! there's a whole bunch of them! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a shame but neither version is really that much fun to play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's possible that you practice the bit and get the hang of this thing you might enjoy it... or possibly not. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fleet Commander 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ASCII 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One day after "Takeda Shingen" we have Fleet Commander, a more old-school Military Simulation Game from ASCII. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suspect a World War II theme, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note the turbo File option. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's what they call saved files in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 ASCII seems to specialize in ports often of Computer Games, but I couldn't find anything about an earlier version of this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So maybe it really is the original title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like the vast majority of ASCII games, this was never-released outside Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So from the main map screen here, you select individual ships in your fleet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's the list of them on the right-hand side, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm going to move the Yamato. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Select the Move option and then point where you want your ship to move To. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each ship can [only] move once per turn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you continue with the next ship in your fleet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when you're all done hit end. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's exciting stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this being a realistic game, naturally, you can't see the enemy fleet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to just, sort of, head over to the top of the screen and eventually you'll probably run into them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also have submarines and aircraft though the aircraft obviously have loaded appeal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It should be pointed out there is a somewhat realistic component to this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All the ships are real ships. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The motto was the pride of the Japanese Navy, and the biggest battleship in the war. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was sunk by the allies of course. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll go ahead and move one of my airplanes, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can move [pretty] far per turn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there we go. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great stuff, huh? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the two sides. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure why called proton and algon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, eventually you will encounter you know, enemy ships and a battle will ensue. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's battles of ship versus ship, aircraft versus ship, and so on - aircraft versus aircraft. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't really do anything during these battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These things are purely random with maybe I assume the ship stats factored in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here I'm battling the Fletcher, a ship that went on to fight in the Korean War as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this kind of gives ya (if you're Japanese) a chance to win the war for a change. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there were a few sequels this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There was a fluke man or two that was released for computers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't believe there was any, sort of, console release for that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a look at the MS M.S.X. 2 version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure if this came out and other computers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 1990 as we can see, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And instantly There was also a Game Boy plead commander in 1991. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm [pretty] sure none of these ever came out in the United States. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I'm not really a big expert on Naval Warfare Games, but this game does seem a little lame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, one thing that's not really apparent in the edited video is the C.P.U. takes very long turns thinking after you've made your move. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the earlier part of the game, it moves your ships you move your ships and then you wait and wait and wait and you know, then move again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It can actually get [pretty] boring waiting for the computer to finish making its move. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And why does it allow you to move your ships on the main map or you can actually see where you're moving to? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, if you ever wondered about playing, you know, Capcom's night important to games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, hey, why is about us to be in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess here's the antidote. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can have the Yamato sync the Missouri, to beat the Li navy, and vent Japan's defeat. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Be-Bop High School: Koukousei Gokuraku Densetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's more Data East. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sadly this is not another turnoff, but instead a Graphic Adventure Game based on a popular manga, Bebop High School. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What exactly is the fascination with word bebop and Japanese pop culture anyway? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note the copyright to young magazine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is appeared in young jump magazine since 1983. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it the series actually concerns a couple of High School tough guys with ridiculous hairstyles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Almost immediately after the strip started, a series of live action movies was produced including to in 1988. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now I will say one thing they the East obviously took great care and reproducing cutie Castro's art style for the characters, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The problem is q cheese art is quite grotesque, and he's fond of drawing characters with enormous Neanderthal like brow ridges, and these horrifying death rip this grins on their faces. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, these grim I guess you'd call them s---ting grins appear quite frequently in the comics and the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bottom line is, in Bebop High School, you're going to see some of the ugliest character art you'll ever see. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mentioned this was a graphical Adventure Game mini you can move your character around in the world with your joystick in, sort of, like the King's Quest style. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As opposed to the more traditional "Portopia..."-style where everything is done through menus. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is, of course, the way most Japanese Visual Novels still operate today. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's just a coincidence, but "High School cumin goomy" and "superband deca" (the Sega Adventure Games) used similar ideas, where you controlled your character directly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe game set in High Schools like this formula? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well throughout the game, you'll encounter a wide variety of weird looking characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even your girlfriend looks kind of freaky! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And since you're a punk, you have the option of fighting with people you meet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can actually hit them in the face; that's one of the commands in the menu. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seemed one of the first challenges simply leave the school. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a cop car parked out in front they'll block your path. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you get rid of the cops you can cross the street and visit some sort of shopping center. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, more seriously creepy and ugly characters, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even though we're outlawed types we'll use the crosswalk. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One locations Data East Arcade (deck of courses Data East company). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But something that's weird: It mentions "AfterBurner" in the lower right-hand corner, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why would they list a Sega Game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Did Data East distribute the game somewhere? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's [pretty] odd. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So obviously this is a bit different than your run of the mill Adventure Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have a couple more Adventure Games next episode, including one (one of the very few) that was released outside of Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we'll be looking forward to that. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Aspic 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 31 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Xtalsoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bothtec 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So now we're getting into the obscure stuff "Aspic" an archaic Action R.P.G. for the F.D.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's funny; in late 1987 we had all these R.P.G.s all come at once and been [pretty] quiet since then. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Published by boat tech, the original game was by Xtalsoft, which they spell with an X. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's an introductory text role, but no opening cutscene or anything like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you start off with a castle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's weird how N.P.C.s are depicted as these white ghostly figures as the approach you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And putting go every single time you take a step that seems a little unnecessary. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the game is off to a rather irritating start. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Go! Go! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this is naturally a port of a computer game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're getting a hell of old-school, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was released in 1986, on cassette for the NSE, P.C. 6001 as well as the FM-7 and the Sharp x 168. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One was the predecessor to the '8801. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is a [pretty] unpleasant on the eyes but don't expect the FamiCom version too much of an upgrade. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fight mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, there you have it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Good stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here's the thing: For some reason, the programmers decided to give this M.S.X.-style scrolling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! the FamiCom was noted for its ability to do smooth scrolling, but somehow that's not what we get, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know if this was due to unfamiliarity with programming for the FamiCom or if they were like deliberately going for retro feel, but it makes moving around in this game, not a lot of fun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the cool thing about "Aspic" (assuming there is a cool thing about this game) is you can convince the swordsman to come and join your party without fighting them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you can actually have them fight monsters instead of you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or you can also attack them like I'm doing, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A good idea that seen from time to time in R.P.G.s of this era, but I don't think that's really used in a particularly creative fashion here, as compared to like, say "Megami Tensei", where, like crossbreed friendly monsters and whatnot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, as mentioned, this is an Action R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Battles performed one-on-one against enemies on a separate screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Basically, you just run up and hit them with your sword. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are Magic Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I assume you learn some magic eventually. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The one thing I didn't see happening was any, sort of, Leveling Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I played around until I got maybe 100 Experience Points but never saw my stats increase. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So who knows? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is the one I was getting to go talk to the King in order to power-up or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I saw a dungeon (or rather a hole in the ground I assume was dungeon) but I couldn't really find the way to enter it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the dungeons are, in fact, in first-person mode, just like the castles and the houses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, by the way, if you're wondering what 'aspic' actually is, like a jelly, sort of, like gelatin that no one really seems to eat too much nowadays. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It, sort of, implies preservation, which seems appropriate because this game is essentially a preserved specimen of a now extinct variety of R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can't really say I'd recommend this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dokuganryu Masamune 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 05 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, it's been a while since we've seen the Namco game, but they're back with "Dokuganryu Masamune" a 'one-eyed dragon masa Mooney'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you suspect this is a historically-themed Strategy Game well then you win the prize. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this game is quite a bit different and slicker and more polished than the "Takeda Shingen" game, as would be expected from Namco. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The interface with your little talking assistant down there at the bottom you saw a moment ago, makes is, sort of, resemble a "Portopia"-style Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike Koei's and Hot-B's Strategy Games, there's quite a bit of dialogue, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, about Dante Moscone, he was yet another Sengoku Era daimyo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again he is in "No..." -- "Nobunaga's Ambition". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He has a couple of distinctive characteristics: 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 His extremely badass helmet (as you can see there, with the large crescent moon on it) but actually one of the most famous Samurai helmets. 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the fact that he [only] had one eye (hence the name of this game). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And one difference between this guy and Nobunaga and Takeda Shingen is that he survived the Sengoku period wars and got along decently with the new Shogun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And he actually, sort of, did all right for himself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, "Final Fantasy" fans if you're wondering, no, the massive money sword is not named after him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's named after a different massone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, he also found his way into like those 'casts in' and 'Samurai Warriors' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Co he uses [pretty] much all these guys in their games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this does seem a bit simpler than "Nobunaga..." not as many options. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can spy on your neighbors, buy weapons from the merchant (that's the merchant there, by the way), you know - raise an army, employed ninjas, usual stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What I'll do here in a moment is all get ready to go war go to war another Daimyo, which turns out to be a [pretty] bad idea because I'm quite outnumbered there, as you can see. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The battles play out in a reasonably dramatic fashion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have this cavalry and infantry control each group of soldiers a turn-based fashion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Engagement occurs automatically to groups of soldiers will start fighting once they actually collide. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this works [pretty] Well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sadly I'm going to get my tail wiped here, as is expected. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well this actually it for the Military Strategy Games is episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there actually is one more next time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Double Dragon 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 08 🇯🇵 // 1988 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Technos Japan 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Technos Japan 🇯🇵 // Tradewest 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Finally, the big game this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 From Technos it's "Double Dragon", one of the most successful games on the N.E.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But let's check out the cool music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That music just perfectly conveys the feeling of crime and punching, which is what "Double Dragon" is all about. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As we will recall, "Double Dragon" first appeared in Arcades in 1987, a sequel to Technos' earlier "Renegade". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the classic Beat-'em-Up plot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your girlfriend is kidnapped by thugs who live all the way over on the right side of town. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was a huge hit in Arcades at the time, and was the game that led to the Beat-'em-Up mania of the late '80s and early '90s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the most notable feature was the 2-Player Co Op, which is quite cool. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, one you could grab a bad guy from behind penning his arms, while the other could repeatedly punch him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, there was quite a lot of characters on the screen often all at once, which would leave some [pretty] heavy slowdown (as we can see here). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With two players, the slowdown could get quite bad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Regardless still extremely popular game and Arcade at the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, here's the intro to the FamiCom version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your girl seems to be wearing a longer skirt here so it's missing the panty shot from the Arcade Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And your badass trans-am is also absent. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In To the console "Double Dragon" it's full of compromises. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most notably, there is no 2-Player Co Op. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's That's right, the main feature of the Arcade Game has been removed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, [only] two enemies at once could appear on-screen, so you're not facing big crowds of enemies, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One widely-copied feature in "Double Dragon" was the ability to pick up weapons dropped by enemies, as well as certain background objects (like barrels or boulders). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This obviously became standard in Beat-'em-Ups, but it's also normal for First-Person Shooters nowadays as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't really recall seeing this much in games prior to "Double Dragon". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was used a bit "Mega Man", obviously, but the idea of just being able to use any weapon dropped by me seems to have been [pretty] new at the time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmm! I'll have to think about that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, there are fewer objects that can be used as weapons in the home version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the Arcade Game, having a supply of boulders and lying around makes them look quite a bit more manageable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though some of the handheld weapons like the whip and the map seem a bit more useful, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps as a result, any weapons will disappear when you move on to the next section. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Double Dragon" is divided into four levels, each with a boss at the end and also increasing numbers of sub-bosses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First two levels are [pretty] simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After that, the difficulty increases rather dramatically. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is adobo, the first boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another feature unique to the home version is the Level Up system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you kill enemies you gain hearts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see your hearts down there in the bottom left. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you gain hearts, you get new abilities. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (I just got an extra heart there.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll start the game with just a basic kick and punch but later we'll get some sort of like little mini combos and new moves, including an insanely useful hair grab, or you grab the hair neom in the face and you can actually throw him as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, since there are a set number of enemies and each level, you can't really like Ryan to increase your heart's (not without utilizing a glitch). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (There's the hair grab and throw right there.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later levels of get a bit weirder. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll find yourself wandering around in caves and some sort of like ancient temple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this gang really wanted their hideout to be, like, completely off the beaten path. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Technos added some sequences involving dodging falling to lactide jumping on moving platforms, though in my opinion, these detract from the overall game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while Billy is [pretty] good at punching and kicking, jumping is not his strong point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fighting and "Double Dragon" is very polished the platforming just filled like, sort of, like intrusive irritations. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we were discussing Taito last episode and their winning fortunes in the console era. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They distributed "Double Dragon" in the arcades, and, of course, "Renegade". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I go so far as to say that "Double Dragon" may have been their last huge Arcade hit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They got the N.E.S. version of Renegade out in the U.S. [pretty] quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you might think that the nestable Dragon would have been a huge Goldmine for them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, actually, no. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure how or why About the rights "Double Dragon" on the Nintendo Entertainment System in the United States ended up with a small Texan company called Tradewest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was their first console release. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Previously they had handled U.S. distribution of some SNK Arcade Games, including "Victory Road". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Soon Tradewest would hire Rare to Golf Games, including, of course, "Battletoads". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A few years later, Tradewest was bought up by Williams and became part of the Midway Williams group. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Technos would end up releasing U.S. versions themselves and their future. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So at the end of the fourth level, he faced a seemingly endless parade of tough enemies and then fight the Arcade Game's boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this person has a new Final boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, the guy behind the kidnapping through girlfriend is actually Jimmy, your own brother. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He was, of course, the guy you played at the second player in the Arcade Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He has a [pretty] shocking conclusions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tough fight, sort of, like Solid Snake versus Liquid Snake or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Double Dragon does get [pretty] brutal near the end, especially since he can't get extra lives and there's no continues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you die (unlike the Arcade Game) you don't, like, instantly rematerialize; the section starts over from the beginning. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thus at the end that last level, you have to beat the three strong enemies without dying. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, in place of the 2-Player Co Op, techniques as a 2-Player versus mode - sort of, a mini Fighting Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can choose between many of the games characters, and they all have different moves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, the sprites been redrawn from those in the main game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a nice touch but doesn't write quite replace the co-op option. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the weird thing about "Double Dragon" is even though so many compromises were made, it's still a great game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose the console version is more well-loved than the Arcade Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A more faithful port was released for the Sega Master System by Sega themselves later in '88, but nobody cares about that game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like "Contra", it's a port that managed to outlive the original to a certain extent. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jīkiru Hakase no Hōma ga Toki 🇯🇵 // Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 08 🇯🇵 // 1989 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Advance Communication 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toho 🇯🇵 // Bandai 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eh... "Double Dragon" who cares? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the one I know you've really been waiting for, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" - another one of those worst ever N.E.S. game candidates, having been rather famously panned by The Angry Video Game Nerd, and Something Awful. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you look at the user views at GameFAQs one out of 10 is the most common score. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so this game is awful, but I wouldn't even say it's the worst game this episode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, first of all, it's bad when the general gameplay rules are not something that could be figured out just by playing the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you have the cart and no manual or you're just plopping the ROM into an emulator, you're not really going to understand what's going on, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much of the animosity towards "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is because if you don't know how to play it, you're gonna die very quickly and the game won't even really explain to you why you died. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya start off as Dr. Jekyll on your wedding day, walking to your wedding. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, since the church is so far away, and citizens are so obnoxious, you really shoulda hired a cab to drive you they're. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well on the streets, kids will shoot slingshots out yet, people run into you, animals attack you, and a Mad Bomber sits off bombs everywhere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are two meters: the 'Life' Meter and the, uh, 'Meter' meter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taking a hit will decrease one or both these meters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If your life runs out, well then you die. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if the meter meter or Stress Meter as the manual calls, it fills up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's when the game gets hairy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You turn into Mr. Hyde. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because Mr. Hyde has like a negative mental attitude or on on life or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you play as him, the world is all topsy turvy, you move in the opposite direction. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's like "Castlevania II" at night; everyone's become a monster. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here's the deal: you have a punch but don't use it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead, pressing up and be will shoot the Psycho Wave, mentioned so prominently in the box art. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Every time you kill a monster with the Psycho Wave, your Stress Meter goes down. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once it's empty again, you transform back Dr. Jekyll. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When it comes Mr. Hyde for the first time you start playing back at the beginning of the first level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hyde can't ever catch up with Dr. Jekyll. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If, while playing as Hyde, you reach the place in the game where you left off as Dr. Jekyll then, according to the manual, God himself will intervene and kill you with a lightning bolt. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's, sort of, like a weird race between the two, and you want Jekyll to win. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there's a lot of enemies but for the most dangerous is that Mad Bomber guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He'll drop a bomb right now as he passes you and then need to get the hell away from the bomb or take massive damage and stress. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For some reason you end up taking far less damage if you on the left side of the bomb when it goes off. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've been playing the U.S. version from Bandai but the original game was published by Toho, the film studio. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The developer, advance convocation, let their name be displayed rather boldly on the opening credits. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original version is a little different, namely, there's a couple extra levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, the first level is not on the U.S. version at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And starts off in a much more difficult fashion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Almost immediately orange With a series of Mad bombers whose Bumble instantly trying to hide if they go off behind you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since this is the very beginning of the game, it's impossible to reset your Stress Meter before you're in the same spot as Jekyll. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So getting killed by lightning is guaranteed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Their bombers in the first level the U.S. version, but their bombs take longer go off so you can avoid you know, taking too much damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also some characters in the Japanese versions not found in the band diversion like these folks throwing things at each other from the windows ([pretty] annoying). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However (on a positive note) there's a lady who will invite you up ("Zelda II..."-style) and refill your health and empty your Stress Meter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now I know what you're thinking, but that's not it because she gives you money. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just mean the Dr. Jekyll is some sort of male prostitute? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So one of the coins do? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well this one particular character sings (apparently very badly) and her notes will damage you quite a bit if you touch them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you have enough money, she'll stop singing when you touch her. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this must be the [only] use for the coins. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There isn't actually in bank to buy in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing about this game is it's not at all consistent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some parts are absurdly easy, others very annoying! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I hate the spiders because you have to sneak below them and you can't just barrel through them because you will get knocked backwards whenever you touch an enemy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When there are tons of running characters and the kid shooting you and the bomb maniac constantly dropping bombs, it becomes virtually impossible to sneak past the spiders. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, this really is a bad game production. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing's explained to the game and basic game mechanics are very counterintuitive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jekyll has a cane but you shouldn't use it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hyde can punch enemies, but you don't want to kill them by punching; you want to use the Psycho Wave. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game has money but it really isn't implemented in an interesting fashion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your character moves way too slow, and it's difficult to avoid many enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This really has nothing to the original story. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, developers seem to have, sort of, added elements of the Incredible Hulk to the story. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So definitely stupid game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is it one of the worst game though system? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'd say it's better than "Kamen Rider Black", which we'll see in a couple minutes. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 FamiCom Grand Prix II - 3D Hot Rally 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 14 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess the big genre at this time period (other than Military Strategy Games) is desert-themed Rally Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've had "Victory Run" on the P.C. Engine, and of course, Paris Dakar Rally. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And now from Nintendo, it's the "FamiCom Grand Prix II - 3D Hot Rally". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, first of all, there should be some sort of epilepsy warning included on this game, since there's all kinds of weird flickering and flashing going on, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's kind of painful to play for very long. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, I do apologize. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game's gonna look weird in spots because of the way that the display at the bottom of the screen appears during the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a really unusual flicker effect going on at all times for this display (maybe attempted to make it look transparent or something like that?). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously the 29 frames per second video couldn't capture it properly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the display doesn't really show up like it should. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes it looks perfectly normal (cannot flash at all). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other times it'll just disappear completely. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So sorry if this looks a bit weird at times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember the first FamiCom Grand Prix was from October 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was a top-down Racing Game and, uh, this one is an "OutRun" clone, right down to the forks in the road. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "3D Hot Rally" is actually, sort of, a shameless the way it rips off "Out-Run". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One unique Nintendo touch: All the roadside objects (street lamps et cetera) all have faces on them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You drive to a wide variety of conditions road desert snow. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Every time you hit something your car takes damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If the, uh... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Oh yeah, this looks [pretty] When you're playing the game itself, that lat past section right there). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If the Damage Meter completely fills up, it's Game Over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But don't forget to set a repair spot like I did when I was playing this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next year pair manually at any time, but you lose time while doing so. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the coolest thing (maybe the [only] cool thing) is the hot meter and unfortunately can't see it, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you click those exclamation points with 'H' found on the middle of the roadway it fills up the meter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shifting from fourth gear into Hot gives you a huge temporary speed boost. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's really nothing special or fun about this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's inferior to "Rad Racer" and "Victory Run" even "Taito Grand Prix", I think. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just to run the mill racer from HAL Labs Nintendo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There was a FamiCom Grand Prix three so I guess no one wasn't too impressed by this game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kamen Rider Black - Taiketsu Shadow Moon 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is the real worst game this episode another F.D.S. game from Bandai. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Check out this amazing intro, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Best part of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Honestly, if this is the dance you have to do to transform into Kamen Rider. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't think it was worth it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wait a second. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Do we just have a 'Kamen Rider' game from Bandai? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, but that was just plain old 'Kamen Rider'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is 'Kamen Rider Black', a new T.V. series that was on the air when this game came out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There have been countless different 'Kamen Rider' series over the years, but they all involve guys wearing bug helmets. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now let me start out by saying something it'll be very obvious. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a really bad game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It looks like just a standard side-scrolling Platform-type Game, but it's a lot worse than it looks! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, the controls are really bad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One button punches; the other jumps. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you want to kick press up on the D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah I know, 'What?'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you're jumping is subpar, even by terrible '80s caching game standards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You always jump straight up and pressing left or right while in midair will cause you some more like roll in the air and then move a little bit to the left or the right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than that you cannot control your jump at all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And why do you jump so high you actually jump into the status bar at the top of the screen? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, lots of games we've had bad jumping. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What makes this one so bad? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, most awful games, there's something weird funny or unique about them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first Kamen Rider game had those bizarre R.P.G. like battles, for example. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kamen Rider Black lacks [pretty] much anything interesting about it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like everything you normally associate with videogames has been sucked out, leaving an empty black hole, the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Level design, there is none just to stretch a flat ground with the various backgrounds imaginable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Action. When an enemy comes at you, you hit the punch button. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Same with bosses you just walk up and keep punching it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hit detection? It barely exists. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can kill enemies by punching over their heads, but on bosses you often find yourself punching over and over again without registering a hit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 From what I've played, the game is simply walk to the level, fight the boss, and then repeat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main frustrations will be the incredibly slow pace at which your character walks, the unresponsive controls (simply turning around is difficult). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the fact that you will get hit by these impossible-to-dodge projectiles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They do very little damage, So just keep walking and try to ignore them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Trying to jump to avoid projectiles is really a wasted effort. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now and it gives you the very final boss of each level, there's slightly bigger sprites for some reason (similar to "Double Dragon" and "Predator"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But compared to this, I mean even "Predator" is a work of genius. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now after this, you do end up getting a motorcycle, which will at least make the game go faster, but still even nothing really happened. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you'll need to like jump over a clip or two. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, this is about it on the motorcycle, right here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The one thing that impressed me is when you hit a bump, you actually fly off and land on your face, which is [pretty] awesome looking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's really about the [only] thing in this game they put any effort into at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, there you go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And check out this upcoming boss bells to see what I mean by really baffling hit detection. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was surprised to learn this was built by Human who normally turn out, well, competent, if not inspired work. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But Kamen Rider is not just a bad game; It's barely a game at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's absolutely nothing here that could be considered enjoyable. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not going to say this is, uh, the worst game I've seen so far, but it comes [pretty] close. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just the fact of it having no redeeming qualities whatsoever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This really was one of the most agonizing, least enjoyable games I've played on the show so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Moero!! Pro Tennis 🇯🇵 // Racket Attack 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 15 🇯🇵 // 1988 October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jaleco is added again with melero Pro tennis, the first in two Jaleco games this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Released in the West as racket attack, This is the second game and Jaleco is more aerosport series, (the first being Moliro pro yaku, otherwise known as "Bases Loaded"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like the first game, this is built by Tose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess you know they're everywhere nowadays. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is a bit more advanced than Nintendo's old Tennis Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can choose your players all have their own strengths (much like leech Reno's "Fighting Golf"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And each with their own really stupid name (mean horn, Eagle, first - who came up with these names?). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So choose your player and you can also choose what kind of court you want to have. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's hard, clay, or grass (grass being the softest) does have a certain, sort of, Testing you know how your ball will bounce and how fast it goes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main novelty in this game is that (you know, just like most Baseball Games) it uses two different cameras. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's this wide view of the entire court when you're serving, and then it switches to a close up view all the balls in play. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A couple things I should mention. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jaleco apparently had to deal with the tennis racket manufacturer Wilson in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The box art mentions a contest to win some test up from Wilson. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Their name actually appears in the game, but in the Japanese version, as we see here, the Wilson logo is completely missing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Didn't appear in the European version either. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So how's the game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's not bad, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It plays decently, but it's nothing too exciting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously Jaleco are going for a more realistic feel in their Sports Games than Nintendo or Namco. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing: It is [pretty] easy to miss the ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You seem to have a bit of momentum when you run and it's probably To not stop and time to hit the ball (he kind of like extra go right past it). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other times the ball just, sort of, like passes right through Yeah. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Bases Loaded", some speech samples are used. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Compare these two samples in the next game coming up and you'll see they're quite good. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I guess it's a [pretty] decent Tennis Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't really care that much for this, sort of, thing myself, but it certainly could be a lot worse. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ikari II 🇯🇵 // Ikari Warriors II: Victory Road 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 16 🇯🇵 // 1988 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SNK | Micronics 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by K Amusement 🇯🇵 // SNK 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Got another one here, folks - a game many of you know and hate, "Ikari Warriors II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This title screen does [pretty] much says it all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To one ugly title screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Game itself isn't so hot looking either. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is the Japanese version any better? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, yeah little. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But still neither version has any music, which is usually a sign from developer that, 'Hey, we don't give a s---!'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And both have horrible speech samples. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I know that that macom was people better than this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So as you might have figured out this is a port of the 1986 s nk Arcade Game known as "Victory Road" in the U.S. and "doko socan" in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not surprisingly, the speech is a bit more understandable here and there's a lot more enemies as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like a car a this game controlled using a rotary joystick, so you can aim and move independently. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the home version, I guess they, sort of, wanted to play up the "Ikari Warriors" connection so it was renamed "Ikari Warriors II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like the first "Ikari Warriors" This was poured by Micronics. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the controls are a major issue, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really hard to get your guide about move and shoot in the direction you want them to. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, Capcom was able to port over "Commando" to the N.E.S. without control problems. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And even the first "Ikari..." had okay controls but this one something is just not right. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Part of the problem is the general uselessness of the machine gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's better to switch to the boomerang. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, it's easier to kill aliens with a boomerang than a machine gun in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With a boomerang you don't quite even try to aim so much. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now weapons have levels; you'll find power-ups for weapons scattered, here and there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily your ammo and grenades are infinite so you can like throw grenade drowned all you want. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So an obvious question: What is with the little weird black screens that appear from entering the inventory menu? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like loading screens? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How did Micronics get loading screens on a cartridge? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's baffling. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh no, I'm being sucked into a vortex! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is actually a minigame that appears from time to time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's, sort of, like shooting skeets, but here's the catch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (That oval moving around is your gun sight.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When we shoot the discs, not [only] your bolt have to hit the disk but your gun sight has to touch the disc at the same time the bullet hits. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you've got to get your gun sight, bullet, and target all Touching at the same time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why? I mean physicists haven't been able to solve the three body problem, but they expect us people to get 3 moving objects to all collide together at once? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, if you hit enough you'll win hearts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If not, you'll lose hearts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole heart thing is new to the home version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of the hearts are actually those red and black things that appear when you kill an enemy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather than being a simple Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't have money in shots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of the shops, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can buy weapons or what chops but also engage in arena fights. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All the way up the guys you fight look totally different when sitting at the bar when you actually fight them in the arena. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 During you toss grenade, which are damn hard to aim properly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this game, don't even bother dating any kind of indication when your grenade actually hits the enemy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know the flash or make a noise just like every other video game in the world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Buddy curry is missing a lot of things he, sort of, normally take for granted video games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or full range of sound effects. For example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Grenades make a noise near throw them but they're silent when they explode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole game is, sort of, Phil's half finished. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When Playing "Ikari Warriors II" nothing really feels right. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And top it off you [only] have one life so the die is Game Over (even "Double Dragon" gives you three lives). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess "Ikari Warriors" fails on almost every level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Horrible graphics (the original used more than just gray and red for colors). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your character doesn't have feet, barely existent sound, terrible controls, general lack of sense. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is one really bad game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So way to go, Micronics. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last good game this episode is another F.D.S. game (this time from Konami array). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is a title that's helped quite a bit of a cult following (maybe one you've heard of) bio miracle but Kuta oupa (the title of which has been translated as bio miracle I'm Hoopa. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, you are Hoopa the heroic baby on him mission to (as far as I can tell) rescue the kidnapped babies of the Kingdom from prairie dog with horns. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now despite his extreme youth oupa is [pretty] tough and is armed with a rattle they'll actually inflate amazing caused them to float away. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While floating way you can hit them cause them to go flying off at high speed knocking out in the other enemies they strike. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So they're, sort of, like koopas in the sky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another very important news for them is you can jump on climate deniers and reach even higher platforms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's [pretty] much the game in a nutshell. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now R.P.G. elements money shops, branching paths minigame; there's none of that in, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bio miracle is an example of taking one simple concept and x it very well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Love that little power-up you have there were your timber labeled like walk around on two legs and become invincible as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The vast majority The game is, sort of, like a Mario like side-scrolling platforming, but just like Mario's They, sort of, switch up a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I love that brutal plain throw you throw reuse like toast in, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And a second away and at one level you're actually eating your way through giant cake of some sort. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most levels and and a boss fight usually against this pink pig. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He shoots out standard enemies which the most in plate and bounce back Adam. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This particular battle is probably the easiest in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later battles have layouts where there's usually a more difficult position to actually get a hit in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our lab like [only] like a small amount of room to actually move maneuver around and. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you get them a certain number of times he'll die on chest or theories or Scorpio to the next level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So enter the second chest with an extra life will appear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each world has three levels and there are seven worlds all together so the game is broken up through you know, just like "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which lead to an interesting point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing that might surprise while doing 'Chrontendo' was there wasn't like a big hole huge Mario close release from the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sure there are lots of side-scrolling games, but very few Like look at and say, 'Hey, this is a Mario ripoff.'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And out of all these Platforming Games are really having them remake good ones. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then there were a few "adventure island"s but many more horrible games like "Miracle Ropit". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Koopa, on the other hand is blatantly inspired by Mario. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even some of the music sounds similar. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It adds a fresh new mechanic (inflating enemies) and interested in, sort of, own complete unique aesthetic and sense of level design. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each will have its own theme, but there's usually like it's based around the world like something that kids would know about (like there's cakes, candy balls of milk school supplies, alphabet blocks) mixed in with platforming staples, like the ice level, the underwater level levels with conveyor belts. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike say "Adventure Island", but never repeats itself; each world is different. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game is always introducing new things; we get new enemies up to the very last World. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of the bosses a pompous looking walrus wearing a top hat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the most original and surprising moment is this level, the entire level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is upside down with gravity reversed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, this one really messed with your head. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't really know how the computer thing fits in with a baby theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But like I was saying Konami keeps this game fresh; it's never predictable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This level is actually [pretty] difficult is because it asks you to like, sort of, think a bit differently than normal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then after this, we get like one of those classic conveyor belt levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Dangerous flying controls and squids for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the way those who use those colored pencils have their spikes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Very ironic that last episode, I was complaining about Taito and the releasing "Warden or Memorial" on the F.D.S., since I thought that technical limitations were responsible for that game's ugliness. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I need to take that back Because this game proves it was perfectly possible to make great look game (by 1988 standards) on the F.D.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There aren't any fancy effects on display, but everything is well rendered and the color scheme is always pleasing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Having seen so many pemahaman games with really ugly colors, I was actually very impressed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite bio miracles unusually cute and colorful appearance, the game is not afraid to throw some punishment at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later levels more insecure that target you directly not, sort of, play around find the best way through level to avoid taking too much damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because the inflatable enemies you'll often find that you have multiple ways through the level (like from taking like the top part of the screen or the bottom part of the tree). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I wouldn't call it you know branching paths, but you have a lot of choices. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point the game is pulling out all the stops and trying to kill you with constant blind jumps and spikes everywhere. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In most games, this would be unreasonable but Konami never takes it too far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Extra lives are plentiful and stuff (you know, like that jumping level), sort of, balances out with less deadly sections. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The final level even takes place in a castle of sorts, mixing up horizontal and vertical movement. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Finally, we'll reach the last boss who looks more like some evil demon goat wizard when you fight him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami eventually gave this game a cartridge release in Japan, which is [pretty] much identical. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was never officially released in the United States, but someone obviously picked up on the Mario acity with the game and pirated versions under the name Baby Mario could be found for a while. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though once again, the game itself has not changed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's odd that it took about two and a half years after "Super Mario Bros." were really worthy successor to come out FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sega did it with Alex Kidd, but that was, sort of, a flawed game in some ways. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, I really can't find anything to complain about. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is just the right length. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's consistently fun and creative. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's never really that frustrating. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The visuals are always delightful. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's one of the most impressive games for the FamiCom in 1988 so far, and one of the few there recommend [pretty] much with no reservations. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fuuun Shaolin Kyo - Ankoku no Maou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Jaleco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, we're almost to the end of April. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And our last game this episode is an F.D.S. released from Jaleco Poon Shaolin, Keo and Coco no mo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a sequel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first game came out almost exactly one year ago in April 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know if you remember it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Quite frankly, I barely remember it myself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, both games are early one-on-one Fighting Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose the forefather of these sorts of games is "Yie Ar "Kung-Fu" from Konami (the Chinese themed Fighting Game). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seems to drop you straight into the middle of the plot here and your first opponent is yourself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (I always thought the palette swap of your own character was supposed to come, like, later in the game in these things.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, controls are [pretty] simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One button punches; the other kicks, pressing up on the D-Pad at the same time as hitting the button will do a high kick or punch (Same with down on the D-Pad). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And jumping -- (well) to jump you hit A and B at the same time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What can I say? The FamiCom [only] has two buttons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And execute a special spinning kick, you hit A, B, and Down simultaneously. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you're looking for easy intuitive controls, then go play "Double Dragon". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Granted, I was unable to approach anything resembling mastery this game, but the fight is gonna play out one of two ways. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I walked up spam the kick button and took out the punt [pretty] quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or my opponent executed some kind of super move that kills you immediately. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Like that guy right there he punches you like 1000 times in a row.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a little hard to see these special attacks coming. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The sprites are so small and there's really not a kind of like advanced warning. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you guys you can't play a game like this expecting it to be anything like a modern Fighting Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The graphics are a bit better than the first game which was [pretty] boring looking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They go for a bit of atmosphere here that one lump we saw it takes place in a lightning storm. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No one has like some wind blowing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mountains and clouds in the background - you can actually see the clouds rolling move across the background. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I saw a limited number of enemies with a lot of palette swaps. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know how enemies how many enemies there are in total. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As was often the case back then this is a single player [only] there's no 2-Player competitive fighting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's hardly a great game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe it would be okay with better controls or at least an easier to use jump. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the spinning jump is [pretty] tricky to pull off; It didn't always work when I tried. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some enemies rather annoying like constantly jump (like this guy is always jumping over you, making him [pretty] hard-to-hit). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still a big time Fighting Game fans might want to give this one a try. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 30 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow, "Ikari... II", "...Jekyll and ... Hyde", "Kamen Rider Black" - what a spectacular collection of crap! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what's up next? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What do you believe a cool game from Konami? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How about a rare English language Japanese Adventure Game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or an obscure "...Zelda" clone I've not played? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe we'll get lucky this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At any rate, I'll see you then. 🍇🍌
