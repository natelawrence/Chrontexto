👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 51 ✨


✅🪞🍊🍓 Hey, folks, it's me, Dr. Sparkle, 🍊 back again with 🍋 "...Episode 51" of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now I'll be honest; 🍊 I've actually had a [pretty] 🍋 rough last couple of weeks. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Those of you who follow my 🍋 Twitter account or check the blog 🍊 will know that our dog, Molly, 🍋 passed away recently at the age of 13. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 And it was all very sudden. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 She seemed fine, healthy, 🍋 then one day she acted a little tired. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 We took her to the vet 🍊 and within a week it was 🍋 - it was all over. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 And she really was an amazing dog. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 She discovered breast cancer 🍋 in two different people, 🍊 and you know it's really 🍋 gonna be difficult without her. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 And then, almost 🍋 immediately afterwards, 🍊 my wife actually 🍋 lost her wedding ring 🍊 (not 'lost' as in 'misplaced', 🍋 but rather 'gone forever'). 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 And even though 🍋 it's [only] a ring 🍊 she had a great deal 🍋 of attachment to it. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You sort of think of your 🍋 wedding ring as something 🍊 you'll carry with you 🍋 for your entire life 🍊 and she was just so 🍋 broken up over it. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 But regardless 🍊 "Chrontendo Episode 51" 🍋 is finally done. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 And one last thing: 🍊 I have some changes planned 🍋 for 'Chrontendo' in the near future 🍊 - hopefully changes people will like. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 More details about this 🍋 will emerge soon. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 For today we have 15 games 🍊 from late November 🍋 to early December 1989, 🍊 including some U.S.-[only] games. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Prepare yourself for another 🍋 Beam-developed game 🍊 and one of the most obscure U.S. 🍋 games published by Nintendo. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Also a couple [of] 🍋 Military Strategy Games 🍊 and two very unusual R.P.G.s, 🍋 including one from Square. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So, let's get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gekitotsu Shiku Battle 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November 17 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tamtex
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Yep, the first of two games 🍋 from November 17th, 🍊 this one's from IREM, though 🍋 apparently developed by Tamtex: 🍊 "Gekitotsu Yonku Battle" 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This is the second Mini Yonku game 🍋 we've seen for the FamiCom, 🍊 and the last - I think. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Mini Yonku, as you might recall, 🍊 were those little highly 🍋 customizable racing cars 🍊 that were quite popular among 🍋 Japanese kids at this time 🍊 (and maybe still are). 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 We've previously seen a 🍋 Mini Yonku game from Konami 🍊 a couple months back. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 That one actually licensed 🍋 the name of Tamiya, uh, 🍊 the most popular maker 🍋 of Mini Yonku cars. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This one, however, 🍋 is totally generic. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 "Gekitotsu Yonku Battle" 🍋 is a very minor slight game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It's a simple top-down, 🍋 arena battle racing deal. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Your object here 🍋 is to collect 'Teki' 🍊 which you do by collecting flags 🍊 and you get flags by 🍋 destroying the other cars. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Ramming into cars will destroy them. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Getting rammed or hitting an 🍋 obstacle will damage your car. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You can see your vehicle's 🍋 health on the, uh, bottom left there 🍊 - it's the Life meter. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So the object is to ram 🍋 enough cars to generate a flag. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 When this happens the flag 🍋 will show up on the mini-map. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You then need to 🍋 rush over to the flag, 🍊 trying to destroy cars 🍋 along the way. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This will raise the 🍋 number on the flag. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 When and if you collect a flag 🍊 you will get the number of Teki 🍋 as were on the flag, 🍊 up to a maximum of five. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There is always a chance 🍊 that another car might 🍋 collect the flag first. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 And then once you've 🍋 collected enough Teki 🍊 you win the round and move on. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 And that's actually it. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Oh yeah, there're -- 🍊 there are these lame animated 🍋 scenes between the rounds. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I -- I hesitate to call 🍋 these cutscenes, exactly. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So a couple points 🍋 about this game: 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Each round adds to the 🍋 selection of cars you can pick 🍊 but, despite some rad names 🍋 (like 'Battle Super Sabre'), 🍊 the [only] difference 🍋 is the sprites. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The cars all function exactly 🍋 the same, as far as I can tell, 🍊 and there's no sort of 🍊 customization options 🍋 or anything like that. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It's a very simple game. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 There are a few special items 🍋 you can pick up on each level 🍊 - the turbo thing 🍋 that makes [you] go faster 🍊 and (much more importantly) 🍊 a star that gives you 🍋 temporary invulnerability. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Other than that 🍊 there's really not much here 🍋 other than smashing into cars. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There are these bonus stages 🍊 where you drive around 🍋 picking up flags for points 🍊 which have no in-game purpose 🍋 other than aiming for a high score. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 And the weird thing is, 🍋 there is no two-player mode. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 That would seem like a 🍋 good idea for a game like this 🍊 but I guess it would require 🍋 cutting the screen in half. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Bottom line: It -- It seems like 🍋 a well-done game in many ways 🍊 but it's just a very, very simple one 🍋 with not a whole lot to do. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ninja Cop Saizou 🇯🇵 // Wrath of the Black Manta 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November 17 🇯🇵 // 1990 April [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by AI
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kyugo Boueki 🇯🇵 // Taito 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 It's been a few months 🍊 since we've seen any Taito 🍋 games released in Japan 🍊 and this episode we have two. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 First up is "Ninja Cop Saizou". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Though the Japanese version 🍋 was published by Kyugo Boueki 🍊 (the same guys who published the 🍋 Japanese version of "Airwolf"). 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Is this about a ninja 🍋 or about a cop? 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 What if I told you it was about 🍋 a cop who was also a ninja? 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 The police commissioner has, uh, 🍋 been working on his forearms, 🍊 as you can see here. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Apparently, someone is 🍋 kidnapping some kids 🍊 and you need to find out who. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now if this sounds a 🍋 little bit like "Shinobi", 🍊 then congratulations 🍋 on your perceptiveness. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I suppose we can safely call 🍋 "Ninja Cop Saizou" a "Shinobi" ripoff. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You have a lot of enemies shooting 🍋 at you from behind crates and things. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Really the exact same mechanic 🍋 as "Shinobi" is used for attacking: 🍊🥝 at a distance, you, uh, throw 🍋 a dart of some sort; 🍊🥝 up close, you automatically 🍋 switch to a blade 🍊 and you have ninja magic as well. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now one new feature here is 🍋 you can walk up to the guys in red 🍊 and grab them, triggering a little 🍋 scene where you interrogate them. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This doesn't impact the game, 🍋 as far as I can tell, 🍊 but it does fill in, you know, 🍋 the details of the story. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 In April 1990 Taito 🍋 released this in the U.S. 🍊 under the name of 🍋 "Wrath of the Black Manta". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 'Manta', by the way, 🍋 simply means 'mantle' 🍊 (you know like a -- a cape or something) 🍋 in Portuguese, 🍊 though I assume 🍋 the name "Black Manta" 🍊 is lifted from the 🍋 Aquaman character, 🍊 who you might recall from the 🍋 'Super Friends' cartoons and such. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 The 'Black Manta' here 🍋 is no longer a cop; 🍊 he's just a regular 🍋 New York City civilian ninja. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 What's interesting is that even 🍋 while he's hanging out at his home, 🍊 he's still wearing 🍋 his ninja outfit. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 All the cutscenes were 🍋 changed for the U.S. version. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Actually, quite a bit 🍋 in this game has been altered. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🎶 *game music* 🎶


✅🪞🍊🍓 For the life of me, 🍊 I don't understand how 🍋 the kid left a note 🍊 at the scene of the kidnapping 🍊 saying he was being held 🍋 at the waterfront 🍊 since obviously he was taken to the 🍋 waterfront after he got kidnapped. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 The game mechanics are 🍊 [pretty] much the same as 🍋 in the Japanese version. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Here you see the new art for 🍋 when you interrogate a thug. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It's not known who's responsible 🍋 for the U.S. version, 🍊 but they lifted a few 🍋 drawings from the old 🍊 "How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way" 🍊 which was a book that Marvel 🍋 put out in the '70s, I believe. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Curiously, a Mindscape game 🍋 called "Infiltrator", 🍊 also stole [an] image 🍋 from that very same book. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 One unique feature in 🍋 "Black Manta" is doors 🍊 - tons of doors to enter. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Each door leads to a small room 🍊 containing either 🍋 a note with a hint, 🍊 or a powerup of some sort, 🍋 or a few enemies. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Rooms do have one 🍋 helpful function. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Killing the enemies inside will 🍋 restore some of your health. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 In theory, though, 🍊 what we want are the rooms 🍋 with the kidnapped kids. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Now, the art here is rather 🍋 obviously traced from a photo 🍊 or someone else's drawing; 🍊 I don't know where they 🍋 stole this image from. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The bad guys' organization 🍊 is called DRAT 🍋 (Drug Runners And Terrorists), 🍊 and there is sort of 🍋 an anti-drug, you know, 🍊 'clean up the streets' 🍋 theme going on here. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🎶 *game music* 🎶


✅🪞🍊🍓 By comparison, 🍊 here's the, uh, much more cutesy, 🍋 kawaii version of the kid 🍊 in, uh, "Ninja Cop Saizou". 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Here's the first boss; 🍋 his name is 'Tiny'. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Using the shadow magic against him 🍊 (which creates, like, a duplicate 🍋 ninja on top of you) 🍊 you can easily shoot his head, 🍋 so that magic is quite helpful. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 By contrast, here's 🍋 the Japanese version. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 He's shorter, for one. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🎶 *sound effects* 🎶


✅🪞🍊🍓 And this is the Japanese 🍋 end-of-the-level cutscene, 🍊 whereas the U.S. version 🍊 has a, uh, sort of slightly 🍋 more cinematic cutscene. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🎶 *game music* 🎶


✅🪞🍊🍓 "Black Manta" and "Ninja Cop Saizou" 🍋 diverge in the second level. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 "Manta" has an air level 🍊 where you fly a ninja kite, 🍋 believe it or not, 🍊 then a jungle scene and some 🍋 more subterranean tunnels, 🍊 whereas in, uh, "Ninja Cop Saizou" 🍋 you have these scenes where you, 🍊 sort of, jump around 🍋 in a city landscape 🍊 and then find, like, a giant 🍋 warehouse or something. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 I can't really call 🍋 "Wrath of [the] Black Manta" 🍊 a very good game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The levels are [pretty] repetitive 🍋 with a few exceptions, 🍊 a lot of time is spent opening doors 🍋 and looking in rooms, 🍊 [and] your character moves slowly. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Just like "Shinobi", 🍊 you have to do a whole lot of ducking 🍋 in order to avoid enemy fire, 🍊 which gets irritating after a while. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So it's not a terrible game but 🍋 I would hesitate to call it good. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Cosmic Epsilon 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November 24 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Home Data
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Asmik Ace 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Ah, yes, another entry in 🍋 the "Who gives a s---?" file: 🍊 "Cosmic Epsilon". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This was the first of 🍋 two games we have today, 🍊 published by Asmik Ace, whose 🍋 logo was a cute little dragon. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 And this was developed by Home Data, 🍋 a rather undistinguished company 🍊 whose credit to this 🍋 point included "Sqoon" 🍊 (that was that, uh, submarine 🍋 Shoot-'em-Up game) 🍊 and Konami's 'Astro Boy' game 🍊 as well as a few other things 🍋 which you probably do not remember. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🎶 *game intro music* 🎶

✅🪞🍊🍓 This is a cool intro and, 🍋 if I'm not mistaken, 🍊 the whole mech suit 🍋 launching itself using rails 🍊 was sort of a cliche 🍋 that originated in 🍊 one of those d--- 🍋 Japanese space cartoons. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Well, this is obviously 🍋 a "Space Harrier" clone. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You know, 🍋 I like the look of this. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I mean, rather 🍋 than going with 🍊 the checkerboard pattern 🍋 on the ground, 🍊 they used... airport runways(?); 🍋 I'm really not sure. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 And the destroyed city in 🍋 the background looks cool. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 You have two weapons 🍋 - dual laser beam things 🍊 (which you can power up if 🍋 you hold down the fire button) 🍊 and a ball of energy thing 🍊 (that is supposedly 🍋 a homing missile 🍊 but which really didn't seem 🍋 to home in on any enemies 🍊 whenever I fired it). 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 This is also a 3D game; 🍊 pressing Select 🍋 activates the 3D mode. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You might recall Nintendo 🍋 sold something called 🍊 the "FamiCom 3D System" 🍊 which were these electric 🍋 shutter-based 3D goggles. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Hardly any games were 🍋 released for this thing, 🍊 but, uh, Square put out 🍋 a few: "Rad Racer" 🍊 and the second 🍋 '3D Worldrunner' game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I believe "Cosmic Epsilon" 🍊 is the last game that 🍋 used the 3D system. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Nintendo would obviously 🍊 return to the 3D concept a 🍋 couple times in the future. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Other than that 🍊 there's really not much 🍋 interesting about this game. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Here's the first boss, 🍋 which looks like the thing 🍊 that dropped the bomb 🍋 in the opening cutscene. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 "Cosmic Epsilon" 🍊 alternates between levels 🍋 that take place in outer space 🍊 and those that take place 🍋 on a planet's surface 🍊 - eight levels altogether. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The enemy designs are 🍋 kinda cool, I guess, 🍊 but unless you really 🍊 can't get enough of 🍋 "Space Harrier" clones, 🍊 there's not much 🍋 reason to play this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Terao no Dosukoi Oozumou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November 24 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Next up is 🍋 "Terao no Dosukoi Oozumou" 🍊 from Jaleco. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Boy! That guy looks really 🍋 excited to be in this game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🎶 *game intro music* 🎶


✅🪞🍊🍓 You know, Jaleco has been 🍋 really heavily leaning 🍊 on Sports-type Games 🍊 for quite a while now. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 They didn't really 🍋 start out that way 🍊 but it seems like 🍋 they've been getting -- 🍊 almost becoming, like, 🍋 a Sports Game specialist 🍊 with tons of Baseball Games, 🍋 Bowling, Basketball. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 They did a Judo Game and 🍋 now a Sumo-Wrestling Game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 And this one was, of course, 🍋 developed by Tose. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 And I'm not going to, 🍊 uh, go as far as to 🍋 call this a Sumo R.P.G., 🍊 but just check this out. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Yeah, so you move 🍋 around on an overworld 🍊 and have random encounters. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This will trigger 🍋 a wrestling match. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now the -- the wrestling 🍋 is [pretty] simple. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You can smack your 🍋 opponent with your hand 🍊 or try to grab him 🍋 by his jockstrap 🍊 and move him backwards. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Honestly, just smacking 🍋 the guy works out [pretty] well. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This drains his energy 🍊 to the point where you can 🍋 knock him out of the ring. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Another [pretty] 🍋 simple method is 🍊 when you get too close 🍋 to the edge of the ring 🍊 you can often spin him around 🍋 so that he is on the edge 🍊 and then you can hopefully 🍋 try to knock him out. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Defeating an opponent will 🍋 cause an item to drop, eh, 🍊 such as this coin which 🍋 increases your experience. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Hmmm... 🍋 Maybe this really is an R.P.G.. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Those things that 🍋 look like tree stumps 🍊 are actually Sumo-Wrestling gyms 🍊 which are required to make 🍋 progress throughout the story. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Here, I tried on a throw move 🍋 which didn't quite push him out 🍊 but was close enough 🍋 that I was able to win the match. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Defeating the guy in the Sumo gym 🍊 gives you a pass of some sort 🍋 to board the nearby ship 🍊 which then allows you to 🍋 travel to the next island. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So it is, sort of, very 'Dragon Quest'-y 🍊 at least in the way that 🍋 it lays out the game world. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 There are also shops that allow 🍋 you to buy new special moves 🍊 and a few items that 🍋 have uses in the game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The objective is to 🍋 travel around the world 🍊 and defeat all the other Sumo champs. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Don't expect anything too complex. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The matches are all [pretty] simple 🍋 with very little strategy required. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 But, you know, this game 🍋 is really not that bad, 🍊 and the whole Sumo Quest angle 🍋 kind of puts a bit of life into 🍊 what would have been 🍋 a very routine game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So I'm certainly not 🍋 gonna consider this to be 🍊 some kind of, like, unknown 🍋 masterpiece on the FamiCom, 🍊 but it's better, I suppose, than I 🍋 thought it was gonna be. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Vegas Connection 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November 24 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Graphic Research
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sigma Enterprise 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Our third game from November 24th 🍋 is "Vegas Connection" 🍊 from Sigma Enterprise and 🍋 developed by Graphic Research. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now there's a Story Mode 🍋 and a Casino Mode listed here. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 And I'll get this, uh, 🍋 straightaway off my chest 🍊 - I could not get 🍋 the Story Mode to work. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It looks like you 🍋 just are supposed to 🍊 select a save spot 🍋 and enter your name 🍊 (just like you would do in every 🍋 other game with a battery save) 🍊 but I could not select 🍋 any of the three spaces. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The Story Mode definitely exists; 🍊 I found evidence of 🍋 that on the Internet. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 And maybe you have 🍋 to unlock it somehow 🍊 by winning some money 🍋 on the Casino Mode; 🍊 I'm really not sure. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Maybe the ROM is defective; 🍋 I don't know. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So, so much for the Story Mode, 🍊 but the actual gambling portions 🍋 of the game are [pretty] d--- basic. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Oh, look how they animated 🍋 the falling coins; 🍊 that's a nice touch. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🎶 *game music* 🎶


✅🪞🍊🍓 So three games, that's all you get: 🍋 'Slots', 'Roulette', and 'Blackjack'. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Now I really don't understand 🍋 the point of these games. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 First of all, 'Slots' and 🍋 'Roulette' are purely luck games 🍊 and seem [pretty] much pointless to me. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 For the slot machines game, 🍊 you get to choose the 🍋 number of lines you want, 🍊 meaning you can [then] get jackpots 🍊 on horizontal, vertical, and 🍋 diagonal matches if you'd like, 🍊 and this costs more 🍋 coins to play, naturally. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Alright, so basically 🍋 you just pull the lever. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 [Pretty] exciting. 🍇

✅🪞🍋🍓 Maybe you'll win some imaginary money. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 'Roulette' is just plain old "Roulette". 🍇

✅🪞🍋🍓 Put some chips down; the wheel spins. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 You know, I guess I can't really 🍋 criticize Sigma that much for 🍊 putting out a generic casino game, 🍊 but this is really 🍋 very, very no-frills. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I'm guessing the Story Mode version 🍋 is a bit more interesting. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 And finally "Blackjack", 🍋 the game which requires at least 🍊 some basic decision-making 🍋 skills and luck. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 They threw in a cute 🍋 lady dealer for this one, 🍊 so I guess this is probably 🍋 the best game of the three. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Bottom line: 🍊 This is a completely 🍋 unnecessary addition 🍊 to the FamiCom 🍋 gambling-game library 🍊 unless the Story Mode 🍋 is somehow actually good. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Lutter 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November 24 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?]
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Athena 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Oh boy, the last 🍋 FamiCom Disk System game of 1989. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 "Lutter", published by Athena, 🍋 which is a [pretty] small company, 🍊 and from which I believe we've 🍋 [only] seen one game so far. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I have no idea what the name 🍋 "Lutter" is supposed to mean. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It's not any obvious 🍊 mistransliteration of an English 🍋 word, as far as I can tell. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🎶 *game music* 🎶


✅🪞🍊🍓 So, "Lutter" is not the most 🍋 beautiful game ever on the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 In fact, it looks downright 🍋 archaic by 1989 standards. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This sure feels like a 🍋 Japanese Computer game 🍊 (maybe, like, something 🍋 ported from the M.S.X.) 🍊 but I actually couldn't find 🍋 any evidence online 🍊 of this being a port. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 "Lutter" is also a game 🍊 that seems kind of baffling 🍋 the first time you load it up 🍊 without any sort of knowledge 🍋 about how it's played. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It looks like "Lode Runner", but 🍋 without the ability to dig holes 🍊 and pressing the buttons 🍋 just brings up windows, 🍊 including a whole bunch 🍋 of R.P.G.-style stats. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Yeah, so sure, this 🍋 looks like utter b---s---, 🍊 but once you figure it out 🍋 it's really not that bad. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 "Lutter" is divided up 🍋 into several castles, 🍊 each with multiple rooms and a 🍋 boss you must fight at the end. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The objective is simply to 🍋 make your way through the castle 🍊 to the boss room 🍋 which will require you finding keys, 🍊 opening up new areas, 🍊 getting items that will allow you 🍋 to access new parts of the castle. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 When you put it that way, 🍊 "Lutter" sounds almost kind of like 🍋 a primitive Metroidvania game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There are also R.P.G. elements; 🍊 you have levels, stats, 🍋 and equipable items. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now, you actually fight enemies directly 🍋 simply by running right into them; 🍊 there's no button-pressing required. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The enemies seem to do 🍋 considerably more damage to you 🍊 if you let them walk into you 🍋 or if they land on your head. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 For the most part though, 🍋 if you don't screw up 🍊 you'll easily kill enemies 🍊 and eventually level up, 🍋 raising your stats. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 In the early levels, the 🍋 castle layout is quite simple. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Uh... You can sometimes move freely from 🍋 room to room and in other cases 🍊 you'll need to find a key 🍋 that will remove an obstruction, 🍊 or use an item that 🍋 fills in a gap in the floor 🍊 allowing you to cross over it. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There isn't any sort 🍋 of jumping in "Lutter", 🍊 though you can fall off platforms to 🍋 land on the platform below unharmed. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 You can also find 🍋 armor and weapons 🍊 in a er... -- these rather 🍋 ugly-looking chest things. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Any equipment is actually equipped 🍋 as soon as you've opened the chest. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So, while "Lutter" has 🍋 R.P.G. elements in it, 🍊 it doesn't really feel like 🍋 an R.P.G. since battles, 🍊 leveling up, equipment management 🍋 (all that stuff) 🍊 is [pretty] much done automatically 🍊 and you can really sort of ignore 🍋 the R.P.G. stuff completely. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Likewise, the fact that there's 🍋 no attack button or jump button 🍊 makes this feel very 🍋 out of place on the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Aside from the, uh, sort of 🍋 similarities to "Lode Runner" 🍊 the game will remind you, uh, a 🍋 lot of ASCII's "Castlequest" 🍊 (known as, uh, 🍋 "Castle Excellent" in Japan) 🍊 another really 🍋 ancient game from 1986. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 We covered that, I believe, in 🍋 "Chrontendo Episode 12". 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 It also lacks the satisfaction 🍋 of a good Metroidvania game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 From what I played, 🍊 there really isn't that much 🍋 sense of surprise or exploration; 🍊 it feels almost more 🍋 like a Puzzle Game. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now, the first boss is way easier 🍋 than you might think it would be. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Overall, this is a 🍋 [pretty] fascinating game, 🍊 way more interesting 🍋 than I would assume that 🍊 a late-period F.D.S. game from a very 🍋 minor publisher would actually be. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So it's definitely worth a look. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Golf-kko Open 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November 25 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Hey, you know what I could 🍋 really use right about now? 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 A totally unnecessary Golf Game 🍋 developed by Tose. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Here we have "Golf-kko Open", 🍋 published by Taito. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 This rather cute and charming 🍋 intro ends with you straight up 🍊 killing this dude 🍋 with a golf ball 🍊 and then teeing off 🍋 while standing on his body. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Look at this guy; 🍋 he ain't gettin' up again. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So the game itself begins with 🍋 you choosing your golf clubs 🍊 and then getting assigned a caddy. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This is your caddy, here. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You can ask your caddy for advice 🍋 and, from what I understand, uh, 🍊 this caddy's advice 🍋 is not particularly helpful. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Reading up on this game online, that 🍋 seemed to be a common criticism 🍊 among Japanese folks 🍋 who have played it. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So this is your standard 🍋 18 holes of golf 🍊 - [pretty] much a bare-bones 🍋 golf video game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 If anything, the control scheme 🍋 is simpler than most such games. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There don't really appear 🍋 to be any gimmicks here, 🍊 or really anything 🍋 to distinguish this 🍊 from the several other 🍋 dozen FamiCom Golf Games 🍊 other than the relatively clean, 🍋 simple yet pleasant graphics. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 We've sort of reached a 🍋 point in the FamiCom's library 🍊 where we've just seen so much 🍋 of this kind of thing already 🍊 and at this point, I mean, what more 🍋 can we really expect from a Golf Game? 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There have been a tiny 🍋 handful of titles that 🍊 have done something 🍋 interesting with the concept, 🍊 but most are just like this 🍋 - I mean, 🍊 just pay Tose to make the game, 🍋 put a cute cartoon on the box art, 🍊 and some people will buy it. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So that [pretty] much wraps up 🍋 "Golf-kko Open". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Let's move on to the next game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Square's Tom Sawyer 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise
🎧🏮🍊♪ Tom Sawyer ♪ by Rush

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November 30 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Square
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Square 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 The last Japanese game 🍋 of November 1989 🍊 and it's the one you've 🍋 been waiting for (or not!). 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It's a weird one though 🍋 - "Square's Tom Sawyer". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The title screen reads 🍋 "Square No Tom Sawyer", 🍊 though the box art 🍋 actually has the English text 🍊 "Square's Tom Sawyer" 🍋 across the top. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So this is an R.P.G. 🍋 based on "...Tom Sawyer", 🍊 and is incredibly the second 🍋 'Tom Sawyer' FamiCom game of 1989. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The first, which is called 🍋 "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer", 🍊 was published by SETA, 🍋 and came out in February. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It was a more 🍋 typical Action Game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 We covered it in 🍋 "Chrontendo Episode 42". 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 This game was, of course, 🍋 released in Japan [only], 🍊 though there was an old 🍋 translation started some years ago 🍊 and we now have 🍋 a new partial translation 🍊 from some guys going under 🍋 the name 'D Manufacturer'. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 [Only] the first part of the 🍋 game is translated so far 🍊 but it will give us a 🍋 good feel for the game. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So "Square's Tom Sawyer" 🍋 is an R.P.G., 🍊 albeit a rather unusual one. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 First of all, rather than your 🍋 typical top-down viewpoint, 🍊 we have this 🍋 three-quarters side view, 🍊 and there's no 🍋 overworld at all. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You move around entirely on paths 🍋 that mostly run left to right 🍊 with occasional intersections that 🍋 let you move up or down one screen. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The way this world is laid out 🍊 kinda reminds me a lot of 🍋 Capcom's "Willow" game. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 The world is divided 🍋 into two types of areas: 🍊🥝 Towns 🍊 (where you can talk to people, 🍋 enter some buildings, 🍊 and where there are no enemies) 🍊🥝 Outside of Towns 🍋 (you'll find areas 🍊 where there are 🍋 few or no N.P.C.s 🍊 and you are randomly 🍋 attacked by enemies). 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 These areas are usually 🍊 woods, swamps, and 🍋 (at least in one case) a city. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 These outside-of-town areas 🍊 sort of act like the overworld 🍋 in, you know, most FamiCom R.P.G.s. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You need to travel through 🍋 them to reach a new town 🍊 or find some item that 🍋 moves the plot forward. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 In the first town 🍋 you talk to a few N.P.C.s, 🍊 you get a couple items, 🍊 [and] can collect two other 🍋 party members, Jim and Amy. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Jim, of course, 🍊 had a much bigger role 🍋 in, uh, "...Tom Sawyer"'s sequel, 🍊 "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn", 🍋 and Amy is one of Tom's girlfriends. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Uh... The main female character 🍋 from "...Tom Sawyer", Becky, 🍊 also makes appearances in the game 🍋 but cannot be a party member. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 "...Tom Sawyer" is 🍋 sort of an odd game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Just like "Tao", 🍊 it doesn't really adhere to 🍋 R.P.G. conventions of the time. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There are a number of 🍋 items in the game, 🍊 but these are either 🍊 one-use items used to 🍋 refill your health or something 🍊 or are simply used to 🍋 advance the storyline. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There are no weapons or armor; 🍊 neither is there money 🍋 or experience points. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 You do have some basic stats such 🍋 as Attack, Defense, and Quickness; 🍊 you also have Hit Points, um, and you 🍋 can Level Up, sort of, when you rest. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Uh... For example, you can rest at 🍋 Tom's home in the first village. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This increases your 🍋 Hit Points, Attack, and so on. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 But for the most part, 🍊 traditional R.P.G. mechanics 🍋 are really not used in "...Tom Sawyer". 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Battles also play out 🍋 very strangely. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The "Final Fantasy" side-by-side 🍋 view is dropped here and instead, 🍊 you sort of have this over-the-shoulder, 🍋 "Phantasy Star II" perspective, 🍊 but the enemies are 🍋 way off in the distance, 🍊 and you run towards the horizon, 🍋 in order to attack them. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Likewise, they jump and land 🍋 right in front of your party 🍊 to attack you. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 There's no magic in this game, 🍋 but you do have 🍊 what this particular 🍋 translation calls 'Tech', 🍊 which is a special attack 🍋 that does more damage 🍊 but doesn't always work. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You can also use 🍋 items in battle 🍊 but, for the most part, combat 🍋 is much simpler in "...Tom Sawyer" 🍊 than it is in, for example, 🍋 "Final Fantasy". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It mostly consists of hitting the 🍋 attack button over and over again. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Your initial objective is to 🍊 make your way through the swamps, 🍋 north of Tom's hometown, 🍊 in order to find Huck. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You'll need to give him a piece of 🍋 bread in order to recruit him. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 He'll fill out the 🍋 fourth slot in your party. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 At this point, 🍋 you can go forward 🍊 with a full party 🍋 [pretty] much at all times, 🍊 and you can also 🍋 find new party members 🍊 and replace existing 🍋 ones if you choose. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So "...Tom Sawyer" feels very 🍋 different than Square's previous R.P.G.s 🍊 like... like "Final Fantasy" I and II. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It was produced by 🍋 Hiromichi Tanaka, 🍊 a long-time Square employee 🍋 who later produced 🍊 "The..." uh "...Secret of Mana", 🍋 "Xenogears", and "Chrono Cross". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 He was also the main designer 🍋 of "Final Fantasy" XI and XIV; 🍊 afterwards, he retired. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The music is by Uematsu 🍋 and is quite excellent. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 "Square's Tom Sawyer" marks the 🍋 end of the era of old Square, 🍊 in that it was the last Japanese 🍋 game published by Square 🍊 before switching completely 🍋 to fantasy-themed R.P.G.s. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Square made games in various 🍋 genres up until this, 🍊 after which they focused 🍋 exclusively on 'Final Fantasy' 🍊 and similar R.P.G.s 🍋 for the next half-decade, 🍊 up until I believe 🍋 "Front Mission" in 1995 🍊 and that wasn't even actually 🍋 developed by Square themselves. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Square did release 🍋 "Rad Racer 2", of course, 🍊 but that was created 🍋 specifically for the U.S. market, 🍊 due to the popularity 🍋 of "Rad Racer" over here 🍊 and it was never 🍋 released in Japan. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Due to its lack of a 🍋 full English translation, 🍊 "...Tom Sawyer" is one of 🍊 Square's most little-known 🍋 R.P.G.s in the west. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 If anything, it's known 🍋 here almost exclusively 🍊 for the shockingly 🍋 offensive portrayal of Jim. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This was [pretty] typical 🍋 of Japan, back in the 1980s. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 They had a fascination 🍊 with crude racial stereotypes 🍋 of black people at this time. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You'll recall, last episode, 🍋 we mentioned the band 'Rats & Star', 🍊 who literally performed 🍋 in blackface. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Things have changed quite 🍋 a bit since 1989 in Japan, 🍊 but at the time, this was 🍋 the sort of thing that was 🍊 [pretty] much accepted over there. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Here, we have your 🍋 first boss battle. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Beating these guys 🍋 gives you the Pendant, 🍊 which is used to obtain 🍋 the License from Becky 🍊 (which allows you to get 🍊 some guy blocking your way 🍋 later in the game to move). 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll make 🍋 your way to the final area 🍊 (which is a cave) and fight 🍋 the final boss, who is Injun Joe. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 While this is certainly not 🍋 Square's best FamiCom game, 🍊 it is an intriguing look 🍋 at Square exploring 🍊 a very different direction 🍋 than they took in the '90s. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Once the new 🍋 translation is complete, 🍊 this would probably be 🍋 worth your time to check out. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 To the Earth 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Cirque Verte
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Before we move on 🍋 to December 1989, 🍊 we need to finish up a few 🍋 U.S. and Europe-[only] releases, 🍊 starting with one of the 🍋 most obscure N.E.S. titles 🍊 published by Nintendo themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 This is "To the Earth". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The intro is [pretty] good. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The story here is 🍋 an alien invasion force 🍊 is unleashing 🍋 biological weapons on Earth 🍊 and, for some reason, 🍋 there is an antidote 🍊 but it's on Neptune, 🍊 so you have to fly the antidote 🍋 all the way to the Earth, 🍊 which explains the 🍋 title of the game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You are literally going 🍋 'to the Earth'. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 First, however, 🍋 you must go to Uranus. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Couple things about this game: 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 First of all, 🍋 it's clearly a Zapper game 🍊 - one of the last 🍋 Zapper-based games, 🍊 the very last being 🍊 another forgotten 🍋 Nintendo-published game in 1990. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There were a few later games 🍊 where using the Zapper was 🍋 optional in some spots, however. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Second, it has a reputation 🍊 for being very fast-paced 🍋 and reasonably difficult. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 All the ships move very very 🍋 quickly and are hard to hit, 🍊 however on an emulator, it 🍋 is virtually impossible. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It's hard as hell to hit anything 🍋 when using an emulator, 🍊 so I could not get anywhere. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You lose energy when you 🍋 fire and miss an enemy, 🍊 which makes it really tough 🍊 since it's so easy to miss 🍋 when playing via emulation. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 The third thing about the game 🍋 is we don't know who made it. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Nintendo had released 🍋 a few games specifically 🍊 for the U.S. market that were not 🍋 localizations of Japanese games, 🍊 but these were 🍋 all developed by Rare. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 "To the Earth" clearly 🍋 isn't a Rare game, 🍊 and the name 'Cirque Verte' 🍋 was found in the copyright records, 🍊 though we have no idea 🍋 who Cirque Verte is. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 G.D.R.I. speculates there might be 🍋 some connection with Locomotive, 🍊 the company that helped 🍋 develop "StarTropics", 🍊 but there's really no 🍋 concrete evidence for this. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 "To the Earth" appears to be 🍋 basically disowned by Nintendo. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It's never been re-released 🍋 in any form, as far as I know. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Even "Donkey Kong Jr. Math" 🍋 got a Virtual Console release. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So definitely among 🍊 the very most forgotten 🍋 Nintendo-published N.E.S. games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 720° 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atari Games | Beam Software
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Mindscape 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 The last thing anyone wants to see 🍋 this episode is a Mindscape game, 🍊 especially one developed by Beam. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Unfortunately, we are 🍋 forced to deal with "720°". 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Prepare to be amazed by Beam's 🍋 programming skills in about one second. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🎶 *game music* 🎶

✅🪞🍊🍓 Yeah... that music! 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 But, you know, 🍊 these things were made as 🍋 quickly and cheaply as possible, 🍊 so we really can't exactly 🍋 expect "Castlevania" here. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now, this is the third 🍋 Mindscape game we've seen, 🍊 the first two also being ports 🍋 of Atari Arcade games 🍊 (namely, "Paper Boy" and 🍋 "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"). 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Those were done by Tengen, 🍋 I believe, 🍊 whereas Beam is the Australian 🍋 company responsible for 🍊 "Back to the Future" and 🍋 "Three Stooges" for the N.E.S. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 "720°" is [pretty] similar 🍋 to "Skate or Die". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You compete in a 🍋 series of skating events 🍊 with some being [pretty] much 🍋 the same in both games 🍊 - such as doing tricks 🍋 on the half-pipe. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There is one big difference, though; 🍋 in "720°", you can roam around freely 🍊 in what's either a skate park 🍋 or just a large public square 🍊 that just happens to have 🍋 lots of ramps and things. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 If you explore the edges and 🍋 corners you will find there is 🍊 entrances to competitions as well 🍋 as shops to buy better equipment. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now, this particular game design 🍋 element seemed [pretty] fresh 🍊 when "720°" first 🍋 hit arcades in 1986. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 While the N.E.S. port 🍋 isn't fondly remembered, 🍊 the Arcade game was 🍋 [pretty] popular at the time. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Unlike earlier games like 🍋 "Track and Field", 🍊 which just drops you 🍋 right into each event, 🍊 you could sort of start the game 🍋 by goofing off and just kind of 🍊 cruising around the game world before 🍋 entering the actual skating events. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You could practice tricks, 🍋 search for money, and just goof off. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It has an appeal similar [to] 🍋 today's open-world sandbox games 🍊 like "Grand Theft Auto". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Of course, this was 🍋 designed to eat quarters, 🍊 so an angry swarm of killer 🍋 bees would come after you 🍊 if you spent too much 🍋 time dicking around 🍊 (killer bees being something that was 🍋 much talked about, back in the '80s, 🍊 though they never did really, uh, arrive 🍋 in great numbers in California 🍊 and kill everyone like we thought 🍋 they were going to, back then). 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now playing on an emulator is tricky 🍊 since it had this 🍋 circular rotating joystick, 🍊 which you used to control the 🍋 direction your skateboard pointed in. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Also, the soundtrack, art design, 🍋 and even the cabinet design 🍊 made it really stand 🍋 out at the arcades. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Unfortunately, approximately 0% 🍊 of the appeal was transferred 🍋 over to the N.E.S. port; 🍊 I mean, visually, it completely lacks 🍋 the style of the original. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Your radical skater dude is 🍋 replaced with some dumba-- kid, 🍊 the music is lame, 🍊 and it lacks the, sort of, wild '80s 🍋 street-culture feel of the original. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 For example, let us compare the music 🍋 for this event, um, in both versions. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🎶 *techno game music* 🎶

✅🪞🍊🎶 *regular game music* 🎶


✅🪞🍊🍓 So "720°" has a grand total of 🍋 four thrilling events to compete in: 🍊🥝 the Downhill skating event 🍋 (which we just saw), 🍊🥝 the Slalom event 🍋 (which is uncannily easy - 🍊 I somehow got the Gold 🍋 the first time I tried it 🍊 without even knowing 🍋 exactly what I was doing.), 🍊🥝 the half-pipe 🍋 (which "720°" calls the Ramp). 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This is [pretty] much impossible, 🍋 compared to the Slalom. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I tried multiple times to get 🍋 any medal and... and failed. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You need to pull off, uh, certain 🍋 D-Pad and button-press combinations 🍊 to do tricks while 🍋 up in the air. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I could occasionally do a trick 🍊 but could never really come close 🍋 to anything, uh, consistent. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This is like, uh, landing 🍋 the plane in "Top Gun"; 🍊 it requires precise timing which 🍋 can [only] be discovered accidentally. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 And lastly, we have: 🍊🥝 the Jump 🍊 (which is actually just a 🍋 single jump after a downhill ramp). 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You are supposed to do 🍋 tricks while in the air 🍊 - not too tough to 🍋 get some kind of medal. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So as far as Arcade ports go, 🍋 "720°" is [pretty] terrible. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It doesn't really add 🍋 anything to the Arcade game, 🍊 which was [only] designed 🍋 to be played for, like, 🍊 around 10 minutes at a time. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Two events can be mastered 🍋 almost immediately, 🍊 and one event requires 🍊 quite a bit of work 🍋 to get any good at, at all, 🍊 so it's certainly not 🍋 very well-balanced. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The Arcade game's main gimmick 🍊 (that is, the 🍋 circular joystick movement) 🍊 can't be replicated here, 🍊 and it doesn't really feel 🍋 anything like the original. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Overall, it's not very fun. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tetris 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 One final U.S.-[only] title 🍋 for November - it's "Tetris". 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 This is the 4th version of 🍋 "Tetris" for a Nintendo console 🍊 that we've seen so far. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Back in December 1988, 🍊 the Japanese version of "Tetris" was 🍋 released from Bulletproof Software. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Then in May 1989, 🍊 there was the ill-fated 🍋 U.S. version from Tengen. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 We've covered the whole debacle 🍋 over "Tetris" rights and 🍊 Tengen's "Tetris" back in 🍋 "Chrontendo Episode 45". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 We also briefly looked at the 🍋 extremely successful Game Boy "Tetris", 🍊 once again developed by 🍋 Bulletproof Software, 🍊 and today we check out 🍊 the final version of the original 🍋 "Tetris" game for the N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This is the Nintendo-published 🍋 port that the Tengen version 🍊 would have been in competition with, 🍋 had Nintendo not quashed its release. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This was developed internally by 🍋 Nintendo, it seems, and it's okay. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 There's two modes - 🍋 the regular mode 🍊 and also the second mode 🍋 which probably no one ever plays. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There's three music tracks 🍊 and there's really nothing wrong 🍋 with Nintendo's "Tetris", 🍊 however [pretty] much everyone agrees 🍋 that Tengen's "Tetris" is better. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It has 2-Player modes 🍋 (both co-op and versus) 🍊 more music tracks; 🍋 it's simply a nicer game. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Nintendo's "Tetris" is 🍋 just plain old "Tetris". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I guess [there's] nothing 🍋 wrong with that, 🍊 but it is presented at a -- 🍋 [pretty] much a bare-bones release. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It plays very well, and if the 🍋 Tengen "Tetris" never existed 🍊 then I guess this would be considered 🍋 to be, like, an N.E.S. classic. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 But unfortunately, it ended up 🍋 being both a really great game 🍊 and something of a disappointment 🍋 at the same time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Conflict 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 01 🇯🇵 // 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?]
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Vic Tokai 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 December 1989 here at last. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Let's kick this off with a 🍋 little game called "Conflict". 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 That's a nice flicker effect here. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So tanks, helicopters, and jets. 🍇

✅🪞🍋🍓 Hmmm... What kind of game is this? 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 A "Commando" Clone? 🍇

✅🪞🍋🍓 A vertical Shoot-'em-Up? 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Well, no, it's actually a 🍋 Military Strategy Game, 🍊 more or less in the 🍋 style of "Military Madness". 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🎶 *game music* 🎶


✅🪞🍊🍓 There are options for 🍋 one or two players 🍊 and you can choose [if] 🍊 you want to be limited 🍋 to moving three units per turn 🍊 as opposed to being able 🍋 to move all your units. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There's a Stage Select screen, 🍋 Difficulty settings, 🍊 and then of course 🍋 the actual game itself 🍊 - not exactly 🍋 super [pretty]-looking. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Now, "Conflict" was released in 🍋 the U.S. as well, in mid-1990, 🍊 so let's take a closer look. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 There are two sides 🍊 (rather 'creatively' 🍋 called 'Blue' and 'Red') 🍊 and you have your 🍋 typical hex-based maps. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There's forests, 🍋 mountains, and so on, 🍊 uh, each of which will 🍋 affect or hamper movement 🍊 or increase your defense. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There's also cities 🍋 and airports which heal 🍊 (or, technically, resupply) 🍋 your units. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Those ugly-looking blue boxes are 🍋 factories, which construct new units. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This uses something 🍋 the game calls 'Fame Points'. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It shows your Fame Points when 🍋 you open up the Command Menu, 🍊 so here, for example, I have 5,000. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Fame Points are earned by doing 🍋 good stuff, like winning battles, 🍊 and are lost by losing battles or 🍋 (even worse) fleeing from battles. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Everything in this game sort of 🍋 revolves around Fame Points. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 As with all these type games, 🍊 there's a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" 🍋 element here, with certain units 🍊 being strong against some types 🍋 and weak against others. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Anti-aircraft guns are good 🍋 against planes, for example, 🍊 while planes tend to be 🍋 strong against ground forces. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now I don't know if I'd 🍋 call "Conflict" deep, 🍊 but it does require a certain 🍋 amount of investment to play. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There's quite a few units 🍋 which have been mostly 🍊 given numbers for names, 🍋 like F-15s, A-27s, [and] F-23s. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There's a lot of aircraft 🍋 - nine types altogether - 🍊 compared to three tanks 🍋 and two infantry-type forces. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Units also have more 🍋 than one way to attack; 🍊 there's a primary and a secondary-🍋 type weapon on these things. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 There's a number of defensive options, 🍋 none of which are intuitively named. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This jet, for example, 🍊 has Turn, Swing, Accelerate, 🍋 Descend, and Look. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You definitely need to get 🍋 a copy of the manual or a F.A.Q. 🍊 in order to figure out 🍋 how to play this thing. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Here, I swung when I think I 🍋 shoulda Accelerated or Descended. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 "Conflict" was published by Vic Tokai 🍋 and I'm not sure who developed it. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 As I mentioned, it's kind of 🍋 an ugly-looking game, 🍊 and I hate those little rectangular 🍋 boxes that your units appear in. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It's sort of hard to distinguish 🍋 one unit from the other, 🍊 just by the graphics, 🍋 so they've added text to the boxes 🍊 which unfortunately is often, kind of, 🍊 laid right on top of the graphics, 🍋 making it somewhat hard to read. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 In other ways, however, 🍋 "Conflict" is [pretty] slick. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The animations are actually 🍋 kind of cool in spots. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 "Conflict" seems overall okay. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I'd probably pick 🍋 "FamiCom Wars" over this 🍊 if you were looking for a fun 🍋 Military Strategy Game, however. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tao 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 01 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Pax Softnica
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Vap 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Hey folks, how would you feel 🍋 if I told you that today 🍊 we have a game from the publishers 🍋 of "Super Monkey Daibouken" but 🍊 what if this game was developed by a 🍋 company that was one of the developers 🍊 who worked on "Mother" 🍋 and "EarthBound"? 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Would you feel confused, conflicted? 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Well good; so now 🍋 you know how I feel. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 This is "Tao", published by VAP 🍋 and developed by Pax Softnica 🍊 who worked on several 🍋 games for Nintendo 🍊 such as "Volleyball", 🍋 "Ice Hockey", "Mother", 🍊 and a few of the, uh, 🍋 Nintendo F.D.S. Adventure Games. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 They also did some 🍋 boring stuff from VAP, 🍊 namely a Baseball Game 🍋 and a Badminton Game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I'd tell you the 🍋 names of those, uh, games, 🍊 but I can guarantee that 🍋 you would not remember them 🍊 and neither can I. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 "Tao" was never released 🍋 outside of Japan, 🍊 but we have a translation 🍋 which makes it playable 🍊 but perhaps not 🍋 completely understandable. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This is some deep stuff, man. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Okay, so you are the red guy. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 "Tao" is very much in the 🍋 mode of the traditional 🍊 "Dragon Quest"-style R.P.G., 🍋 at least visually, at first glance. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 We've seen this so many times; 🍋 we know what to do. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You go around town, talk to people, 🍋 check out the shops, 🍊 talk to the main dude 🍋 who explains your quest. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Except "Tao" doesn't really 🍋 have you do any of that stuff. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 In fact, the concept 🍋 behind "Tao" appears to be: 🍊 'What if we had an R.P.G. that 🍋 was nothing but fetch quests?'. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Or at least that's 🍋 what the game felt like, 🍊 for the time that I played it. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 As we'll see, it's a very odd game. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 As you walk around town, 🍊 you'll find the typical collection of 🍋 N.P.C.s who say stupid stuff to you. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There's a meteor crash site 🍊 where some researchers have 🍋 dug up a mysterious artifact. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There's a train station 🍋 and a helicopter pad, 🍊 neither of which can 🍋 be used at this point. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 There's a temple, eh, which again mostly 🍋 has a lot of monks inside, 🍊 who gab about nothing 🍋 particularly useful 🍊 but instead discuss 🍋 various religious matters. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 "Tao" has a religious theme, 🍋 as the name might suggest, 🍊 and we get a lot of talk about 🍋 Buddhist themes in the first village. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Later towns, uh, have 🍋 different religious beliefs. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 The first incident, of sorts, 🍋 that actually occurs 🍊 is when you exit the village 🍋 and find this old lady 🍊 who demands you carry her 🍋 back to the temple. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Upon entering the temple, 🍊 she turns into a demon 🍋 and steals some sacred items. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now at this point, you can 🍋 move on to the second village. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The method of transport is a 🍋 giant dinosaur that you ride, 🍊 which seems completely out of 🍋 place with the rest of the game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 And again, everyone here 🍋 is obsessed with a religion, 🍊 and there's a giant wrecked cathedral, 🍊 and folks talking about 🍋 lost pigs and stuff. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 One thing you won't find in either 🍋 village is any typical R.P.G. stuff. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There's no shops, inns, equipment, 🍋 guys who teach you magic - 🍊 none of that stuff. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There's also no overworld, per se, 🍊 just these little paths 🍋 outside the villages 🍊 which have a couple 🍋 buildings you can visit. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 You fight your first 🍋 enemy battle here, 🍊 and again it doesn't really follow 🍋 typical R.P.G. protocol at all. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Rather than selecting 🍋 from a menu, 🍊 you simply hit the A button 🍋 over and over again, 🍊 slowly draining the 🍋 enemy's health bar. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 In a way, this game - it sort of takes 🍊 the "Dragon Quest VII" 🍋 approach to R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 It takes quite a while before you 🍋 actually get your first battle. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I didn't really encounter 🍋 many random enemies 🍊 until I reached the 4th town 🍋 (and there's [only] six towns). 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So six towns, no overworld - 🍊 'What is there to do in this game?', 🍋 you might wonder. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Mostly travel back and forth 🍋 between the same six towns 🍊 over and over again, 🍊 talking to people which will, um, 🍋 occasionally unlock new events, 🍊 and occasionally fighting 🍋 a boss of sorts. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 What's irritating 🍋 about all the travel 🍊 is it's always done by 🍋 trains, which is linear. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So to get from town four 🍋 back to town one, 🍊 you take a trip from town four 🍋 to town three, 🍊 then a second train ride 🍋 from town three to town two, 🍊 and then from town two 🍋 back to town one. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I assume the helicopter 🍋 eventually unlocks 🍊 and lets you travel directly 🍋 to any town using a helipad. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 And, you know, even though this 🍋 is called an R.P.G., 🍊 it feels more like an 🍋 Adventure Game that has 🍊 sort of been awkwardly forced 🍋 into behaving like an R.P.G.. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You mostly progress by wandering 🍋 around talking to people, 🍊 attempting to move 🍋 the plot forward 🍊 (though calling it a plot 🍋 is perhaps a bit generous) 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There isn't even any eh... 🍋 Experience Points or stats. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 You do get money 🍋 from winning battles, 🍊 but money is mostly used 🍊 to pay for the nonstop train trips 🍋 that the game requires. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There are a few things 🍋 you can spend it on, however, 🍊 later in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 In conclusion, "Tao" 🍋 is a [pretty] strange game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It looks like an R.P.G. but 🍊 playing it feels sort of like 🍋 wandering around talking to N.P.C.s. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Its subject matter and 🍋 strangeness might appeal to you, 🍊 but actually playing it feels 🍋 like a [pretty] empty experience. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mirai Senshi Lios 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 01 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Pack-in-Video
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pack-in-Video 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 This is a reasonably decent intro here. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 From Pack-in-Video we have 🍋 "Mirai Senshi Rios". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Also transliterated as 🍋 "Mirai Senshi Lios". 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 It was released on December 1st, 🍋 the same day as "Conflict", 🍊 which is significant because both 🍋 games are Military Strategy-type games. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Though, while "Conflict" is 🍋 sort of based on real-world combat, 🍊 (it features tanks and jet planes) 🍊 "Mirai Senshi Lios" is pure fantasy 🍋 and exists in a world of R.P.G. castles 🍊 and anime-style giant robots, sometimes 🍋 called 'Mechs' by the geekerati. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 The good news is that we have 🍋 an English translation 🍊 - by Aeon Genesis no less. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I guess your character, Lios, is a 🍋 prince or some such nonsense. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now, I mentioned that this is 🍋 a Military Strategy Game 🍊 but it's really more like 🍋 a Tactical R.P.G. in some ways. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The Tactical R.P.G. as we know it 🍋 didn't really quite exist yet, 🍊 but it's, uh, definitely 🍊 a different style of game 🍋 than something like "Conflict". 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 There's a certain amount of R.P.G. 🍋 style customization here, 🍊 something not found 🍋 in the many many (if any) of the 🍊 traditional Military 🍋 Games we've encountered. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You have multiple types of 🍋 Leg and Arms that you can equip. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 These impact your stats, uh, 🍊 the speed over which you can 🍋 traverse different types of terrain, 🍊 your 'weight point' (meaning 🍋 how much weight you can hold). 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It's all [pretty] complicated. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 You move around on an overworld 🍋 and encounter enemies on each square. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Some squares will contain a special 🍋 weapon or piece of equipment 🍊 and others contain 🍋 nothing of interest. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Battles are turn-based. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 By default, you control 🍋 the commander directly. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The commander is the 🍋 most powerful unit 🍊 and is the one that we were 🍋 choosing the equipment for earlier. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 The other units move 🍋 automatically but are controlled 🍊 using a few different options. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 For example, there's Attack, Assault, 🍋 All-Out Assault, Cover, and so on. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Just like with "Conflict", 🍊 you can, sort of, study up on 🍋 what these commands actually do. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 For example, Attack has the unit 🍋 head towards the enemy commander 🍊 but will attack any other enemy units it 🍋 comes in contact with along the way, 🍊 while All-Out Assault will head 🍋 towards the enemy commander 🍊 and/or the enemy's shuttle, but 🍋 not attack any of the regular units. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There's a total of eight 🍋 different Automated commands, 🍊 or you can simply choose Manual, 🍊 which lets you directly 🍋 control your unit instead. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 And another little twist: 🍊 you have a shuttle which 🍋 resupplies your units. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It's a thing that looks kinda 🍋 like a mini space shuttle. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 You don't have to 🍋 move it around manually. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You select which unit 🍋 you want to resupply, 🍊 then it flies off and 🍋 returns automatically. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 You can supply one unit per turn. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 The object here is to destroy 🍋 the other team's commander 🍊 as well as their shuttle. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Once you win the battle, 🍊 you return to the 🍋 overworld and proceed. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 It's a, uh, creative and 🍋 pleasant-looking little game 🍊 and one that definitely 🍋 takes a very different road 🍊 than the other Military 🍋 Games we've seen so far. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It did feel a little 🍋 slow-moving and tedious to me, 🍊 possibly because when 🍋 the units attack each other 🍊 they seem to miss a lot, 🍊 but it definitely might 🍋 interest some of you. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hostages: The Embassy Mission 🇯🇵 // Rescue: The Embassy Mission 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 01 🇯🇵 // 1990 January [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by New Frontier | Kemco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 //  🇺🇸 🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Okay, the last game this episode, 🍊 and we are still 🍋 stuck on December 1st. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 From Kemco it's 🍋 "Hostages: The Embassy Mission", 🍊 a rather strange game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Note the credit to Infogrames; 🍋 we'll come back to that later. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 [Pretty] sick soundtrack, here, as well! 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 However, most folks watching this 🍋 will know it by its American title 🍊 "Rescue: The Embassy Mission". 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Not sure why the name was changed. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Maybe "Hostages" sounded 🍋 a little too violent 🍊 for a game bearing the 🍋 Nintendo Seal of Quality? 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now I mentioned this 🍋 was a strange game 🍊 and here's the thing: 🍊 it's incredibly short 🍋 for this sort of game. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 While you can't really assign a 🍋 length to something like 720°, 🍊 "Hostages" is an Action Game 🍋 with three different levels, 🍊 and it [only] takes around 🍋 seven/eight minutes or so 🍊 to play through the entire thing. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I just released a so-called 🍋 longplay video for this thing, 🍊 and the entire video including, like, 🍊 opening, uh, cutscenes, credits - 🍋 everything was, like, seven minutes. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 That was done on 'Regular' difficulty 🍊 and I was playing through 🍋 it as fast as I can, 🍊 but still, that's really 🍋 not much of a game. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 And keep in mind I've never even 🍋 heard of this game until now, 🍊 and, uh, when I finished 🍋 it for the first time, 🍊 my clear time, the actual 🍋 time playing, like, the action portions 🍊 (not including the menus 🍋 and those kinds of things) 🍊 was less than, like, uh, five 🍋 and a half minutes. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So this is, like, a fricking $40 game 🍊 that you could easily beat 🍋 in less than 15 minutes. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Now there's harder 🍋 difficulty levels 🍊 and the message that you 🍋 get at the end is different 🍊 if, for example, none of 🍋 your team members gets killed, 🍊 but there's really not a whole 🍋 lot of replay value to this 🍊 (at least as an adult 🍋 there's not much). 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So, as I mentioned, 🍋 there's just three sections. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The first is where you run along 🍋 a little stretch of embassy wall 🍊 and avoid the searchlights 🍊 by lying prone on the ground 🍋 or hiding in a doorway 🍊 or doing this rolling jump thing 🍋 - really not that much to it. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 If you die, the next guy of your 🍋 three-member team gets to go. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 And if you wanted to 🍋 reduce your time on this 🍊 you could get one guy 🍋 all the way through safely 🍊 and then get the 🍋 other two quickly killed. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 The second section is 🍋 a brief sniping sequence. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So for each of the 🍊 team members that made it 🍋 through the first section, 🍊 you can use them to shoot guys in 🍋 the windows with a sniper rifle. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There are nine windows in all. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 There are terrorists that 🍋 sort of move around on each floor 🍊 and when you see them 🍋 you can shoot them. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 If all three team members are alive 🍋 you can do this three times, 🍊 with each one on a different 🍋 side of the Embassy building 🍊 - or you can skip 🍋 the whole d--- thing. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 The game doesn't 🍋 require you to shoot anyone 🍊 and doing so doesn't really 🍋 seem to have that much impact 🍊 on the next section at all 🍊 - at least, once again, 🍋 not on 'Regular' difficulty. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 On [a] higher difficulty, 🍋 there's a lot more terrorists 🍊 in the building so I guess it 🍋 might be somewhat convenient; 🍊 take out a few of 🍋 them before going in. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 It's hilarious but, 🍊 far and away, the hardest part 🍋 in this game is right here: 🍊 rappelling down the walls. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 This is done by alternating between 🍋 pressing Up and Down on the D-Pad, 🍊 slowly lowering yourself to a window, 🍋 and then you can sort of 🍊 break through the window [and] 🍋 enter the embassy building. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Once inside, you simply need 🍋 to kill all the terrorists. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Now it might come as no surprise, 🍊 based on the modular game design 🍋 and the robotic gameplay, 🍊 but "Hostages: The Embassy Mission" 🍋 was originally a European Computer game 🍊 called simply "Hostages", 🍋 published by Infogrames 🍊 and developed by a Spanish 🍋 company called New Frontier. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 It was released on everything 🍊 from the Commodore 64 to the 🍋 Z.X. Spectrum to the M.S.X., 🍊 but I believe that the 🍋 Atari S.T. and Amiga versions 🍊 were the first versions of this game, 🍋 being released in 1988. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Aside from the somewhat 🍋 better graphics and sound, 🍊 the S.T. and Amiga versions are 🍊 almost exactly the same 🍋 as the N.E.S. version. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 If anything, the Computer 🍋 versions seem slightly shorter, 🍊 as they appear to have fewer terrorists 🍋 to hunt down in the last stage. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 So as I mentioned, 🍊 the last section simply 🍋 involves going through each 🍊 of the Embassy's three floors 🍋 and shooting the terrorists. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I suppose they hypothetically 🍋 shoot back at you, 🍊 but they don't really 🍋 seem to pose any danger 🍊 (at least in the 'Easy' or 'Regular' 🍋 difficulty level settings). 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 They are a bit quicker on their 🍋 toes on the 'Hard' difficulty setting. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So really what we're doing here is 🍋 just looking at the map on the left, 🍊 making sure we enter 🍋 every room with a dot in it, 🍊 and then shooting any bad guys. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 As crazy as it seems, 🍋 the Computer versions 🍊 got [pretty] good reviews 🍋 from some game magazines. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 A lot of people really seemed to 🍋 like the game when they were kids, 🍊 which makes sense 🍋 because kids, you know, 🍊 often like really repetitive games. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So while this has its defenders, 🍊 it's, uh, it's sort of shocking 🍋 how little content "Hostages" has, 🍊 especially for [an] N.E.S. game 🍋 that cost, like, 40 or so dollars 🍊 back in 1990. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 51 Wrap Up ✨


✅🪞🍊🍓 Alright, that wraps 🍋 up another episode. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Ah! What a horrible 🍋 selection of games! 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Uh... Best game this episode? 🍇

✅🪞🍋🍓 Uh... I don't know. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 They're all really 🍋 not that great. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Maybe "Tetris"? 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 I mean there's a lot of okay games 🍋 that I can't really get excited about. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 "Lutter" was kind of cool. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 I think I'll take a pass on this one. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Worst game? 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Maybe "720°"? 🍇

✅🪞🍋🍓 It was [pretty] terrible, 🍊 though there ought to be 🍋 some kind of mention of 🍊 "Hostages: The Embassy Mission", 🍋 for just... for being so d--- short. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 Well, I am now pleased to 🍋 inform you that we have 🍊 actual great games coming up. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 Yes, I can assure you that 🍋 in the next three episodes, 🍊 uh, each episode will have 🍋 one of those classic games 🍊 (the ones that you guys 🍋 have been waiting for). 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 And there's, uh, even more great stuff 🍋 coming up after that as well. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So the good game drought is 🍋 [pretty] much over, temporarily. 🍇🍌


✅🪞🍊🍓 "...Episode 52" will have [an] influential 🍋 Japan-[only] title from Capcom, 🍊 which just got a new 🍋 improved translation. 🍇

✅🪞🍊🍓 So keep your eyes peeled 🍋 for "...Episode 52" soon 🍊 and thanks for watching! 🍇🍌
