👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 44 ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Hello, and welcome to "Chrontendo ... <FORTY-FOUR::44>". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We're going to do things a little differently today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sure, we'll be covering all of April <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But this will leave us with [only] <twelve::12> games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 To make up this we've got a sizeable chunk of bonus content. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 On the menu today is a whole mess of Namco releases, some notorious kusoge, one really hard Action Platformer, and a great classic from Technos Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Let's dive right in. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 A Week of Garfield 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 April 07 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Mars Corp 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Towachiki 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Notorious. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's the word for our first game today, "A Week of Garfield" (or perhaps "A Week of Garfield, Garfield", as per this title screen). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For "Garfield no issue Khan" as it's often called, the box art and the title screen both of the title in English. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As we saw there, Garfield asks od Where's he going? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Then the game begins. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess we're supposed to understand that od has disappeared or run off or something and Garfield is looking for him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Know what, sort of, odd is a Garfield is just apparently walked around in his own house and is set upon buy mice and frogs and spiders. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't know why all these creatures are slowly investing the household but Garfield must avoid them mostly by jumping. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But you can try kicking them if you want to test your luck. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Kicking enemies in this game is very risky, not [only] because the kick literally has no range, as you can see here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I've been trying to get the spider but can't seem to get close enough. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But you're kicking Tak often ends with you taking the damage instead of the kicky. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 See while trying to kick the spider I somehow touched him and died. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And you have just one life in this game, but you do have infinite continues. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the fact that there are so many Easy Ways to Die makes the game very tiresome. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now what's very important here is finding the many indivisible items. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is done either by walking around on all fours or constantly jumping around like an idiot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Walking around normally will not work. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Many of the things that you find on the ground are going to be some sort of power. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, the coffee restore your health. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Know as a 'Chrontendo' public service announcement, I'd like to point out that caffeine can sicken or even kill a real life cap. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The lasagna power-up is quite handy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It gives you temporary invincibility. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also, there's boosts for speed increase and objects that can be used as a projectile weapon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Finally, you'll need to find the hidden key in order to exit each level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so look at this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can't walk on the bushes, unlike just about every other background object we've seen so far. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this is typical of wicked Garfield. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can't always distinguish platforms from background decoration. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I'll let you in on a secret. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 People don't like this game very much. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Was apparently bought by a company called Mars Corp. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I have no idea who they are. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I don't know any other game they did. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But this one is [pretty] terrible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Garfield has been slow and almost defenseless unless you're using the projectile weapons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And these are fast and cannot be out of nowhere. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have a Life Barbara can disappear very, very quickly if you get hit, since you don't have any, sort of, temporary and vulnerability. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The art and music are just insipid. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Look at this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This looks like crap. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Levels are just random platforms to jump on or over and enemies are simply moving around randomly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The sound design is awful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Check The projectile weapon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It goes like, it sounds like a particularly awful fart noise. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And even worse, the game doesn't even tell you how much ammo you have in stock of each projectile or even if you have any ammo at all. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Unless you recall picking up some ammo and not using it you never know for sure what will happen when you press the fire button. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And let's face it, nothing here really makes much sense. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, sure, Garfield is more of a standard for a human being rather than a cat. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why would a cat hate Mondays? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Cats don't work. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But why do the mice birds and bugs act like kryptonite to Garfield? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As a cat owner, I can assure you that a cat versus mice, or birds, or frogs is not a fair fight. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Those things are basically cat food on legs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And why did they make the enemies you know, something that was so harmless to a cat? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why didn't they make them other cats, or dogs, or animal control dies, or aliens, or something? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 While the bosses or other cats. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it's like the enemies in America To gain more meatballs or pieces of pizza or something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Or why is the speed of item in the shape of shoes? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean cats don't wear shoes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why not catnip. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Again, is just a really quickly done generic platform with Garfield, sort of, shoehorned in. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's worth playing [only] out of morbid curiosity. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dragon Spirit: Aratanaru Densetsu 🇯🇵 // Dragon Spirit: The New Legend 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 April 14 🇯🇵 // 1990 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco | Now Production 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // Bandai 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, we have a whole bunch of Namco games today - not one, not two, or three, but four Namco-published titles. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 First up is "Dragon Spirit: Aratanaru Densetsu". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For some reason is is the [only] Namco published game today that got us release. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Number Namco is not actually publishing games for the N.E.S. themselves so it was published by Bandai in the U.S.A. "Dragon Spirit: The New Legend". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Right away, we get a little tech scroll and then the game begins. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But this is not the real bang. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Knowing, sort of, a training level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's very short and at the end, you battle the boss czar. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, I guess that's how it's pronounced. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He's [pretty] easy, but he has a gimmick of a staff that blocks your shots. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You seem to shoot him when the staff is not locking away. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Defeat him and you'll get this little cutscene where it's revealed that the real bad guy, Golda kidnapped your sister. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You didn't get the famous animated sequence where he turned to a blue dragon in the game proper begins. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This was, of course, in the Arcade version as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However, if you die on the training level, you get a different cutscene where it appears that lace (the brother) is simply having nightmares. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then you start the game with the Gold dragon, which is much more powerful than the blue dragon and is going to make the game much easier. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So the training level essentially selects the difficulty of the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, the easier goal dragon setting is much shorter and doesn't have the real ending so we'll go with the blue dragon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And we've encountered "Dragon Spirit..." before and "Chronturbo Episode <TWO::2>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was originally an Arcade Game from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987> - sort of a fantasy version of "Xevious". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The cool thing was your dragon can power-up by growing extra heads - up to three. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's the first level boss some sort of dinosaur sea turtle thing, more or less the same boss on the Arcade and the TurboGrafx version. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So to distinguish this from the P.C. Engine version, they gave it that new subtitle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And it does, sort of, follow the tradition of getting a very straightforward port to most systems. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But you know, the game being changed up to the FamiCom version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Aside from the opening scenes, you also now have this between level dialogue which is brand new to the FamiCom game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so clearly the graphics here are not nearly as impressive as those in the art Paid game or the P.C. Engine game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But in some ways this works in your favor. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You see your dragons sprite is a much smaller. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One thing may "Dragon Spirit..."s so hard was just how huge your dragon was. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here are the sprite is smaller and the hitbox is reduced even more. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And when you find the power-up that shrinks even further the game becomes much less irritating. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Is a phoenix type boss I guess. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You destroy it once and then it comes back to life. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Just like "CBS", you have both ground and air enemies to deal with, and separate air-to-air and bomb type weapons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The bomb weapon has very little range and must be aimed very precisely in order to score a hit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some bosses like this one requires us both the bombs and the fireballs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the P.C. Engine in this game sort of bugged me so I give it a bit of a short shrift. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'll play all the way through this version of "Dragon Spirit..." as a form of penance. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 To me it's a bit more fun to play and the P.C. Engine game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here's a weird level reading to avoid the sharp walls of the cave, and then always expanding then closing in on you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now there are a number of number of power-ups to obtain. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And maybe the best is the White Dragon which shoots double fireballs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you get the white dragon, you're [pretty] much Golden. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This will make the game much easier. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 All the extra firepower allows you to kill most bosses [pretty] quickly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There is also the obligatory ice level again with very short pointy walls and destructible barriers blocking your way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You also get one of these sequences where the scrolling speeds up a lot need to like, sort of, wind your way through these twisty passages. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Requires a bit of memorization. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 After the Eiffel boss, things start getting a little crazier and you dive into the ocean and get an underwater level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One nice thing about the N.E.S. "Dragon Spirit..." is the power-ups are [pretty] frequent. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean you obtain them by bombing the dragon eggs on the ground, but in He's dropping quite a few as well. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is, especially helpful here at the end of the game, which gets [pretty] tough. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The last level is a long multi part deal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh, here's a cool power of attorney your regular shot and like an earthquake like weapon that kills everything on the ground. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We can get booby trapped quarters here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One thing you really have to watch out for are the things that look like power-ups with a skull on them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These will actually power you down to the basic dragon form. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And sometimes they can be very hard to avoid when you're passing from narrow passages. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The final boss is one of those two part bosses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 His second form appears to be some sort of like alien creature. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He's not hard but it does take a while. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And then you get the closing screens and the real ending. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Golden was slayed by the blue dragon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Granted, that's not the worst grammatical error found in a Japanese game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it's kind of weird because the English text seems otherwise [pretty] well done. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And on top of that, we have to come to grips with the fact that your heroes name is lace. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Seems like there may or may have been a transliteration problem they're. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still "Dragon Spirit: The New Legend" is a [pretty] solid Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe not as great as Konami's "Gradius" and "Salamander", but it's way better than say goes "Bomber Raid". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mindseeker 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 April 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Game number two from Namco and on the way the oddest is "Mindseeker". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Not too exciting of an intro. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is definitely the low budget game for Namco today. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Let's fire it up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Name, the message speed, et cetera, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Huh so this looks like Adventure Game a Science-Fiction individual game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though the interface has [only] two commands, view and exit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can use the fill command to examine things. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This looks [pretty] normal so far. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But here's the thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is actually an E.S.P.-themed Game<SLASH::/>Simulator, featuring a real life Japanese, quote-unquote "psychic" named Massoud Aki keota. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You younger kids might not know this, but psychic entertainers were, sort of, like a thing in the <SEVENTIES::'70s> and <EIGHTIES::'80s>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Kyoto was called the Japanese are a gillar. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Geller being an Israeli magician who became, sort of, famous by performing goofy psychic tricks on TV, most famously bending spoons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Keota also went along a career path of spoon bending, though he was once caught cheating by the T.V. cameras. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 All this seems completely ridiculous nowadays, but you know, the <SEVENTIES::'70s> and <EIGHTIES::'80s> were wacky time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Most of the game consists of these tests of your psychic abilities. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You might recognize as in our current true "Ghostbusters", I assume. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This all seems to amount to an elaborate guessing game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But I think there might be a way to like actually like beat the game (mean, other than having real psychic powers, of course). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, "Mindseeker" comprises exactly <fifty-percent::50%> of our codename quotient day. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We'll see the other half a little later. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Aoki Ookami to Shiroki Mejika: Genghis Khan 🇯🇵 // Genghis Khan 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 April 20 🇯🇵 // 1990 January [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Koei 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Koei 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Switching gears a lot, we have a another historically-themed kohi game, "Aoki Ookami to Shiroki Mejika: Genghis Khan". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The title means 'The Blue Wolf and the White Pine: Genghis Khan'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In case you're wondering, 'what is this title about?', well, Genghis Khan's ancestors you are said to be the progeny of a wolf and a deer, which is obviously symbolic of something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now this seems like a [pretty] weird and obscure things in a video game after well, it's actually probably inspired by a [pretty] famous historical novel called "out to commie" by a very popular Japanese author is sushi, you know, which was actually about Genghis Khan. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Of course, Koei released this in the U.S. just like "Romance of The Three Kingdoms". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Koei seemed really committed to English releases for all of their very text heavy Simulation Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The opening text describes the whole wolfen dear thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now obviously, graphics and music were not the primary focus of this game, but the music is still awful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And look at this; I mean, dang, that's just ugly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game offers two campaigns: Mongol conquest and world conquest. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Mongol conquest takes place in Mongolia and the goal is simply conquer and unite the various tribes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now for You younger folks who went through the now broken American Public School System, Genghis Khan was the title given to a Mongolian warlord to loujen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the late <Twelfth::12th> and <Thirteenth::13th> Century united the various Mongol factions and carved out an enormous Empire stretched from Korea to Turkey, and almost to the border of modern day Finland. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 His grandson was kubla Khan, the renowned to the career of stately pleasure domes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Okie ookami" first saw the light of day as a Japanese Computer Game, which makes sense. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Koei was primarily a Computer Game publisher at this time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I don't know that "...jingis Khan" really makes the transition that well to the N.E.S.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The interface is [pretty] hard to maneuver around and it's very slow. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the graphics aren't really that polished. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still, it's a [pretty] deep Strategy Game, compared about just about everything else on the game console at that time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, it is very, very similar to "Romance of The Three Kingdoms". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The layout menus command And so on are almost identical. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Basically what to do entertain to assign jobs to your people, create an army, and jobs tax rates, form treaties with your neighboring states, while monitoring the amount of food, money and troops you have. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can do cool things like send spies the neighboring Kingdoms, marry off your daughters, and at some point you'll need to start conquering. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though I would not recommend doing it as quickly as I'm doing here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Battles are just like those in "Romance of The Three Kingdoms". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Move around on a map with rectangular tiles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, while Genghis Khan is obviously very well-made any Strategy Game, it's not really that great. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, it's mostly a well-made game, but a it's really just "Romance..." given a slight facelift and all the names changed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And B it doesn't really have the same addictive quality that later Strategy Games do. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And there's something very satisfying about laying out buildings and creating armies and games like "Civilization" or the Blizzard games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's fun to watch her Soldiers arrays, enemy buildings. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And after playing modern Strategy Games stuff like Genghis Khan just seems so abstract. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I feel kind of detached from my warlords. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't know maybe you feel differently. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe you really like this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 World conquest plays out on a Eurasian map. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can play as England, Japan, the Mongols or the Byzantine Empire. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's basically the same idea as the Mongol conquest mode, except now you conquer the world - or rather, Europe and Asia. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well, anyway, there's nothing wrong with this game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Right Like this, sort of, thing, then give it a try. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 Game Boy in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> ✨


🤖🍊🍓 One thing we've been noticing is that the last couple of years the output of Nintendo develop games for the FamiCom has decreased somewhat. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, other than "Super Mario Bros. <THREE::3>" and "FamiCom Wars" in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nintendo has focused mostly on "Portopia"-style Adventure Games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But big name triple A games produced by Nintendo have become Quite scarce. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So what was all of Nintendo staff working on? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, part of this it was, of course, the Super FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 By <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> work on "Super Mario World" and other launch titles was already well underway. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However, there was another project, one that had been consuming the resources of Nintendo RND one since <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I speak, of course, of the Nintendo Game Boy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 No, let me clear up one thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There is not, nor will there ever be, a Chron-Game-Boy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, I would be remiss if I didn't least cover some of the highlights of the Game Boy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So today we'll very quickly blow through the first year of releases. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The person most associated with the creation of the Game Boy is, of course, Gunpei Yokoi - one of the most influential figures in Nintendo's history. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yokoi created the ultra Han toy which led to Nintendo shifting its focus towards toys and games in the late <SIXTIES::'60s>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later, he came up with the idea for the Game and Watch which were simple handheld L.C.D. games produced by Nintendo throughout most of The <NINETEEN-EIGHTIES::1980s>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The classic D-Pad was first used in the game and watches. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, of course, the double screen gaming watch design clearly inspired the Nintendo DS. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Game Boy was the logical successor to the Game and Watch Series. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Basically, it was a gaming watch mated with a FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game and watch this could [only] play one game each. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the Game Boy on their hand was cartridge based - little teeny cartridges. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There was a rumor that she just taught Oh, boy, the creator of the 'Earthbound' games came up with the name Game Boy, but this is apparently not true. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And besides the name isn't that creative. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It obviously derives from the Sony Walkman. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It was released on April <TWENTY-ONE::21> <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> in Japan, and was an instant hit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Considering how popular the FamiCom was in Japan this was not surprising. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There were five launch titles, most notably a new 'Super Mario...' game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Back in the <EIGHTIES::'80s> it usually took quite a while for console to get a release outside of Japan. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But since then, it's No entertainment system was [pretty] well established at this time the Game Boy came out [pretty] quickly over here in July <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the U.S. it was bundled with "Tetris". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Game Boy is an example of what Yokoi called mature technology sometimes translated as withered technology, meaning it wasn't really a state of the art, but was cheap to make and easy to program for. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 From a technical perspective, the Game Boy was in some ways superior to the famine calm in terms of processing power and also had more RAM and FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sure, it was in black and white or rather shades of green, but it was cheap and didn't use too many batteries. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 By comparison, Atari is competing handhold The Lynx was way more powerful, had a <SIXTEEN::16>-bit graphic processor, and a huge color palette, and <SIXTY-FOUR::64> K of RAM. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was released two months after the Game Boy in the U.S. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was way more expensive and sold a fraction of what the Game Boy did. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So in this case, it appears that Yokoi was right. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The bottom Online it was an inexpensive fun system with addicting games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The ads pushed to something that everybody can enjoy even adults. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There were a total of <TWENTY-FIVE::25> Game Boy titles released in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> many of them quickie titles from crappy publishers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So let's do a quick rundown. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Out of the five Japanese launch titles, far and away the most interesting and best is (surprise, surprise) "Super Mario Land". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now this game has the distinction of being developed by gameplay Yokoi rather than she wrote me a Moto. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It does seem a little like an alternate universe version of 'Mario'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Many of the same elements are there (mushroom is, fire flowers, koopas). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But there are some strange differences, like the Egyptian setting and the first world are the way there can [only] be one fireball on the screen at once and, sort of, keeps bouncing around everywhere. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And here's something new, you can jump into the upper door and get a bonus of some extra lives. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One thing I should point out: This was also a launch title in the U.S. in August <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So "Super Mario Land" came out before "Super Mario Bros. <THREE::3>" in the U.S. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But after the oddball "Super Mario Bros. <TWO::2>", so it might not seem so strange to U.S. gamers at the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh yes, bows was missing and Princess Peach has been replaced by Daisy - who would turn up later in the Mario Sports Games from time to time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Overall a good Mario game, but the future games the 'Mario Land' series is would make major improvements. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the remaining four launch games were not so impressive. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Alleyway" was developed by Intelligent Systems, a Nintendo first party developer who also did stuff like "FamiCom Wars" and "Fire Emblem". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And its "Breakout" or maybe "Arkanoid". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The cover art shows that your panel is actually a spaceship powered by Mario and Mario is face appears as the icon showing a number of lives left. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the bonus levels blocks are formed into 'Mario' related shapes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it's basically just "Breakout" with a 'Mario' theme. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The early Game Boy releases from Nintendo resembled some of the early FamiCom releases. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Case in point: "Baseball". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You remember the old Nintendo "Baseball"? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, this is it in Game Boy form. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now "Baseball" in Japan was one of the biggest filling FamiCom games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So importing a Game Boy is not a surprising move. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now those three games are actually all launch titles for the Game Boy in the U.S. as well. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One Japanese launch title it was never released outside Japan was "the Akuma on" - a friggin Mahjong game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Of course, there has to be Mahjong game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Can "Golf" be far behind? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, this was the first game in Nintendo's 'the Octomom' series of Mahjong games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Exciting stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 By <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> many many third-party publishers were on board with Nintendo and the family so it's not surprising there was one non-Nintendo game released at launch. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 House Shanghai is a port of... yes the Activision Computer Game that we've already seen three times. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This one uses a different title screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not the old two Chinese guys playing Mahjong game together. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 That's Shanghai is the first game we've seen on the FamiCom, Sega Master System, and TurboGrafx-16, and the Game Boy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It really gets around. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, the Game Boy version is not that great. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's, sort of, too small hardest hit the tiles, and you have to scroll left or right to see all the tiles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So that's April, and there was one game released in May, "Tennis" by Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's basically the old FamiCom "Tennis", right down to Mario in the referee chair. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The sprites have all been updated, ever so far, we're not really seeing a whole lot of original original ideas on the Game Boy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, June again has [only] one game, but it's a huge one. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yep. "Tetris" the Game Boy game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is the game that basically sold the Game Boy, at least in the U.S. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now at this point, "Tetris" had been released on various computer platforms, and the arcades, and all the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the Game Boy version was the one that would cause it to completely blow up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When the Game Boy was released in the U.S., "Tetris" was bundled with the system. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was the system seller. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Total sales were around <THIRTY-FIVE::35> million. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Game Boy version was got my Bulletproof Software, who also did the FamiCom "Tetris" - there's the Japanese FamiCom "Tetris". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I love a lot more to say about "Tetris" in a future 'Chrontendo'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So moving along, there was nothing in Japan released in July or August. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then of course, the Game Boy hit the U.S. Knox as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But then things started to kick into high gear. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 September saw the first big wave of third-party publisher's. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Bandai naturally has the first game released with "Hyper Lode Runner". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now Hudson's 'Lode Runner' series was a huge hit on the FamiCom and Irem had started releasing low bar games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But I really don't know how Bandai got involved. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, here it is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's another 'Lode Runner' game, this one developed by Tose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Another Puzzle type game, this one from Pony Canyon was "Sokoban" the old Thinking Rabbit Computer Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This one got us released under the name "Boxall". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We've already seen "Sokoban" the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But in case you need your memory refreshed, it's the game where you push but never pull boxes around, try to move them from one spot to the other. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And then speaking of games that were already released on the FamiCom, it's "Mickey Mouse" from Kemco. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We just saw the console version back in "...Episode <FORTY-TWO::42>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is quite similar to that game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Move around collecting hearts and avoiding enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And just like that one in the U.S. Kemco didn't have the rights to the Disney license. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So instead it was a 'Bugs Bunny' game, "Bugs Bunny is crazy Gasol". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's funny, I really had no idea that this is one of the very first Game Boy releases. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Finally, we have the first Game Boy title from Konami, "Motocross Maniacs", the sequel to "Motocross Champion"s, a relatively recent FamiCom game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It came out in late January <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The series ended up being more successful on handhelds and it got several sequels. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 [Only] thing is I have no idea how to play this damn game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it is, sort of, an odd choice for Konami's Game Boy debut. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 October is a different story. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Konami released "Dracula Densetsu" or "Castlevania The Adventure". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now of "Castlevania <TWO::II>" is the black sheep of the series, then this is the blacker sheet. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are no special weapons; there is not even the stairs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There is no Clock Tower; sign in sheet knees up ropes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It barely resembles a "Castlevania" that we know and love. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now it's called a terrible game and a long list with "Mario Land" it's one of the first sides going Action Platformer for the Game Boy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it's definitely a very minor 'Castlevania' game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We also have more crap from another new publisher talk in house is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This seaside "Volleyball" built by tosta? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Better elites in the U.S. by Activision under the name "Malibu Beach Volleyball". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And then finally, we have how putting out "Pinball <Sixty-Six::66> Hiki No wanting to die, Cushing" and odd alligator-themed Pinball Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This actually got a U.S. release under the name "Revenge of the Gator". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not half bad and it has some nice touches. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like when you lose a ball, it gets eaten by a giant alligator. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The whole thing is, sort of, strange. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, there are two games in November, starting with a new one from Nintendo, "Golf". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 First "Base cold" and "tennis", "Mahjong", now "Golf". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nintendo was just releasing all the old FamiCom games on the Game Boy, it seems? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This does, sort of, initiate a bit of a pattern with Nintendo - releasing the same games over and over again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also in November was the first Game Boy title from the publisher Atlas. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is "puzzle boy" known as "cork" in the U.S. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Sadly, the Game Boy has gotten set the record for the most shovelware released in the shortest period after launch. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 December sees a bunch of new titles, but most of them are from low grade publishers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like "Kyson game navy blue" from USE. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Too we're looking title screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the U.S. It was called "Battleship" because well that's what it is - a 'Battleship' game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Just like, you know, the game you played when you were a kid. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It was one of those ones where you can use the game link to connect to Game Boys. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I guess it seems like a decent idea for a handheld game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's just not very original. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "techie techie" or "boomers adventure and asmin world" was another, sort of, simple little Puzzle-ish Action Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Asmin Cohen, a little red dragon, would have a go as being a mascot character for Asmik. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But he very soon faded into oblivion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Q billion" is the seemingly random name given to this Puzzle Game from Seta. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sort of like "Sokoban" with a third dimension added in. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You push around stacks of blocks trying to flatten everything down to ground level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's a good little game, but the graphics are a bit abstract. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This might have worked better if like the height of the stacks or depicted some other way than by just putting numbers on them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Have less interest to us is 'Shogi' a showbie game from Pony Canyon? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Obviously it's never came out in the U.S., but I can see how being the first 'Shogi' game for the Game Boy might have given it certain out of appeal and Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Even worse is "Pachinko Time" published by Coconut Chapin and built by Marionette. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yep, it's a game from the 'Paci Oakland' guys. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was the first of several Game Boy Pachinko games from Coconut Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And let's not forget "this to the north star" from Toy animation. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Rather than being a Beat-'em-Up like the other 'Fist...' games we've seen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This one's a one-on-one fighter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It seems [pretty] awful, as you would expect from a 'Fist of Norstar' game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Bandai dips into the well of old us Computer Games for the second time for "Master Karateka". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Karateka" was the first game for Jordan Mechner, and we've already seen the N.E.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Needless to say, the Game Boy "Karateka" is inferior to the FamiCom release. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this was, once again, developed by Tose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now you wouldn't think R.P.G. to make much sense on a handheld, considering the battery life limitations, but chemical released "selection era brushy" which came out in the U.S. as "sort of hope". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is, sort of, an Adventure Game R.P.G. hybrid. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game uses a first-person viewpoint and as well as a difficult to use mini map that moves around on the game world. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It seems virtually forgotten today. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now aside from "Super Mario Land", "Tetris", and the "Castlevania" game, probably the most will remove Game Boy title from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> was "MCI Toshi saga". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the U.S. it was renamed "Final Fantasy Legend". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Was designed by Aki Toshi Colossi - the guy who is generally held responsible for making "Final Fantasy <TWO::II>" so messed up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Was he was taken off 'Final Fantasy' series and given his own series of R.P.G. games, we can make the mechanics as strange and opaque as he wanted. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, the first game is actually [pretty] normal and not that far removed from the 'Final Fantasy' games aside from certain weird things like weapons that were down and break as he used them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As a rule, Game Boy titles had shorter delays between the Japanese and the U.S. release. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 NEs result this came in came out in the U.S. [only] a few months after "Final Fantasy" hit the Nintendo Entertainment System. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There we have the <TWENTY-FIVE::25> games released in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, many of which are almost completely forgotten. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 What's surprising is a lack of big name publishers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Other than Nintendo, Konami, and square, there's no Capcom, Namco, Tecmo, Title, Hudson. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Eventually those guys would join the fold. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But for the moment the pickings for the Game Boy or a little slim. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari 🇯🇵 // River City Ransom 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "3030" ♪ by Deltron 3030

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 April 25 🇯🇵 // 1990 January [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Technos Japan 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Technos Japan 🇯🇵 // Technos 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 First of all this music is sick! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Downtown the katsu Monogatari, the third game in Technos 'Kunio-kun' series. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though maybe it should really be called the 'Nick ketsu' series because most games have the word 'katsu' (meaning 'hot blooded') in the title. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it does star everyone's favorite High School juvenile delinquent, qu neocon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game has a High School settings all the characters wearing those weird military inspired uniforms. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though in the game the end up looking, sort of, like pajamas. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first two 'neocon' games were released in the U.S. under the "Renegade" and "Super Dodgeball". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "we're going to gain" was a huge art Hit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So naturally Technos released "Nick Katz who downtown with Atari" in the U.S. as "River City Ransom". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There's quite a few options here, one or two players. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's two difficulty settings and even message speed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the enormous gaping hole in "River City Ransom"'s plot is of course, the ransom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Ryan's girlfriend has been kidnapped by the mysterious gang boss, Slick. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Any mentions his demands. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But he doesn't actually name them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He also states that quote-unquote "no one can stop me". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But stop him from what? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What's the point of the kidnapping? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The manual goes so far as to mention Slicks ultimatum, but doesn't provide any further details as to what exactly he's trying to accomplish. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now "River City Ransom" is, of course, a Beat-'em-Up, much like "Renegade", but with a difference. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As we've seen countless times in 'Chrontendo', the R.P.G. has infected the heart of Japanese video games, to the point where it every single genre now has Hit Points and stats levels, money, and shops added in. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Thus Technos has made this an R.P.G. Beat-'em-Up hybrid. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Obviously, the first order of business is to knock the crap out of everyone you encounter on the street. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They will then drop some shiny bouncy coins for you to pick up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now if nothing else, "River City Ransom" provides a strong argument against doing the gang. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Crime literally does not pay in this game, as gang members typically have around <fifty::50> cents to $1 on their person - not even enough to buy a burger and a coke. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once you get to the first shopping center, you'll find it completely devoid of any criminal activity. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yes, it's business as usual at the malls, despite the fact that everywhere else in the city is completely under the control of violent gangs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can spend money on things like food, which will typically raise one or two of your stats and restore some of your health (or stamina, as it's called here). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So here, your staffs; you have quite a few. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I've raised my willpower Our defense a bit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Everything starts off at <FIFTEEN::15>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So here's the thing; neither the game nor the manual tells you what each type of food actually does. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You need to eat it and find out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here I'll try the salmon, which is quite expensive but raises some stats, refills my stamina, and raises my max power. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That is at length into my Life Bar. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There are some non-food shops as well like the bookstore which sells these books that teach you special techniques. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Stone hands allows you to punch super fast, and dragon feet will make you kicks were fast. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Both are very useful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now that I read the stone hand book, I can totally wail on dudes with these lightning fast punches. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So the overall structure is somewhat like an R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When you move forward, you collect money, and you spend it to refill your health and increase your stats. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Along the way, you'll encounter bosses that block your progress. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's relatively linear, but you do need to backtrack at least once. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And you can refight old bosses to pick up extra money if you want. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's a warehouse. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So the game is that even taken over places of business. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Where the police during all this? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, if gangs occupied an entire city to this extent, I'm sure the National Guard would have been called in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And this parks and abandoned tunnel. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why are there no cars on the road? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now there is a super secret shop here but it sells really expensive items and you'll need to grind quite a bit to afford the stuff they sell. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The bosses (like Turk here) give you a little speech when you fight them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now powering up your attacks using with stolen hands is extremely helpful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The bosses aren't really that special. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're mostly just, sort of, faster and more aggressive versions with regular enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And you can't really lose "River City Ransom". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Dying just takes you back to the last town or the last shopping mall and takes half your money 'Dragon Quest'-style. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is this, sort of, similar to the 'Grand Theft Auto' games, now that I think about it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Near the end To the game you'll find the sauna, a Japanese-style bath house and we are treated to a bit of naked rear end. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Where this episode of 'Chrontendo' is relatively high and backside nudity. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And Alex is a High School student so this is probably technically child porn. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So the FBI Ollie over to your house shortly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I hope you like prison. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "River City Ransom" became a popular cult hit for the N.E.S.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Unfortunately technics Japan never really quite followed up with a sequel, at least not the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Various 'Neo Kuhn' and 'downtown ketsu' games were released. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But "River City Ransom" never got like the the "Link to the Past" or a "Super Metroid", if you know what I mean. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was ever released to a few different platforms, including the P.C. Engine, which we'll see in 'Chronturbo' eventually. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And years later, a Game Boy Advance remake called "River City Ransom E.X." was published by Atlas. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As we see some changes have been made and the game has actually, sort of, given graphics to match the original Japanese version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 By this point, I've upgraded my character quite a bit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I purchased the very extensive Texas boots I guess we're like cowboy boots in the flat iron mall. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These boots are an equippable item that maxes out your agility and kick attack power. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I also have purchased the Grand Slam from the Oak Hill bookstore, which allows you to perform rapid weapon attacks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Quite frankly, the Grand Slam makes the boss's almost complete pushovers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can just keep knocking them down every time they try to get up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At long last... well, not really that long - "River City Ransom" is longer than your standard Beat-'em-Up but it's not really geographically that huge. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And it's not really like actual R.P.G. length or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But finally, I've reached the downtown High School where Slick is holed up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Other bosses guarding the entrance. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 After this is a short distance to the top floor. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You'll find a few more bosses along the way, but nothing too tricky. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not really a difficult game at least, not on on the easier difficulty level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, of course, on the tougher level, and then you can just grind more and buy more stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If you spend the time to Level Up your stats, it's, like I said, really not that difficult. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And it's not that long; a minute speed run takes, I believe, about seven minutes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now these guys are cool. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a set of brothers and the theme from "Double Dragon" starts playing when they appear. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And again, the Grand Slam will just completely destroy them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's optional, but you can actually rescue the kidnapped girlfriend - who doesn't really seem that impressed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 She also appears to be about <ten::10> years old. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At this point, you, sort of, realize the utter incompetence of Slick when it comes to things like kidnapping and ransom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean there's lines of communication must be extremely bad. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Alex has been making his way across the city beating up everyone his path, yet Slick still keep Cindy, the girlfriend, and unlocked room with no guards. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He think he would have moved her to a different location as Alex approached. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Slick Meanwhile, is hanging on the rooftop doing nothing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When you talk to him, he's revealed as... Simon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now who Simon? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 No idea. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Apparently he's a friend of Alex and Ryan's. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But his identity is no surprise since the game manual actually lists Simon as the final box. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Admin mentioned, "River City Ransom" became quite a fan paper over the years, mostly because it was a little different than every other Beat-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But we shouldn't fall into the trap of thinking that "River City Ransom" was like completely revolutionary. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As I mentioned earlier, a lot of games at the time that used R.P.G. elements. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Quite frankly, if you change the game to a Fantasy style setting and gave Alex a sword, this would be a very basic side-scrolling Action R.P.G. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is mostly the urban setting and unarmed combat that makes it stand out so much. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, at its heart, it's really like a very simple version of "Castlevania <TWO::II>" in a modern setting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still, it's a great game - maybe techniques Japan's best in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And if you've never played it, I would definitely check it out. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Devil Man 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 April 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ISCO 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Namco game number three, "Devil Man". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Two rather ugly looking dude. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Obviously "Devil Man" is a Japan-[only] game, but we do have a rather handy translation from Snark. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Why is the main bad guy called Xenon? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Nova is just about the least scary element there is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Something here about frozen demon horns. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But how they get frozen to begin with? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 How do you freeze a demon? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The art in this intro is suitably weird looking. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At Actually like this intro. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so you are this guy, Akira fudo. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When you start off you can walk around and enter some rooms... were really not much happens. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you go outside we'll find some purple dudes on the streets and you can hit them all you want but they never die. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So far this looks [pretty] inscrutable. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well, guess what "Devil Man" is based on a manga... and not just any manga but "Devil Man" was from the pin of the pioneering artist go and the guy originally published in the early <NINETEEN-SEVENTIES::1970s>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's been animated several times, including this version from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Basically, it's about a guy who, sort of, gets semi-possessed by a demon so he can fight the demons are invading the human world, and it's full of sex and violence naturally. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, knowledge of the characters and plot "Devil Man" are required to make much sense of this game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Without that "devilman" just appears to be a series of random actions that you have to perform. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And of course, it is linear to a rather imposing degree. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It wants you to do everything in a very particular order. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, talk to this guy to ask if you watch TV. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I say yes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Into the room behind them decorated in a rather shocking hot pink, and it's empty. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As because you gave the wrong answer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 They'll go back outside this time answer no to this question. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then suddenly, your girlfriend is in the room. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Where did she come from? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 How did she get into that room? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And that's how the first part of the game goes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sort of walk back and forth down the street entering the five or so level buildings in the correct order, until you reach this guy who tells you that the underworld opens. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And suddenly you are here, wherever this is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 By the way, those block thing the background can't be jumped on. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There, just random background stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is the first action sequence. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Adequate You will probably get instantly killed... multiple times. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Need to punch these things until your anger meter fills up and a glowing orb appears. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this is way harder than it looks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have like actually no invincibility after being hit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And you'd have to get so close to punch these guys you often take a hit as you're attacking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But once you grab that you transform into "Devil Man". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Suddenly you're much stronger and can destroy enemies and a few punches. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You then go back to the main street and it's kind of funny because you can talk to N.P.C.s in Devilman form and they will just freak out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At this point you need to perform a number of actions and talk to various people just like before. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For a while your girlfriend takes over and you'd have a boss fight. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Again, none of this will mean anything to you unless you know the plot and who these characters are supposed to be. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I suppose if nothing else we should give a "Devil Man" so credit ports variety. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It seems to be, sort of, vaguely in the "Castlevania <TWO::II>" mode of side-scrolling Adventure Games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But each level was quite a bit different than the one before it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once you leave the city with your actual sequence. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I do like the part where I've done then transformed into like the gigantic mech size "Devil Man" and then walks out of the city. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I have no idea who developed this game, but a certain level of technical and competence is demonstrated. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Jump physics are really wonky and there's a slowdown in places, the level is very amateurish, the art is [pretty] ugly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I guess it tries to look like go to guys drawings, but the characters just mostly come out looking, sort of, deformed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Probably from someone like toes or Micronics, or one of those guys. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a shame because it's like a cool concept. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the game might, sort of, remind you of better games like the 'Shin Megami Tensei' games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Too bad Namco basically waste the license and didn't try to produce a better game like this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dragon Buster II: Yami no Fuuin 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 April 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Namco has a bit of a thing for dragon-themed games this episode. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here we have "Dragon Buster (<TWO::II>): Yami no Fuuin" (or 'Dragon Buster <TWO::II>: Seal of Darkness'). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I wonder when the first example of using a sword for the letter 'T' in a video game logo was. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We see it quite a bit - 'Dragon Quest', for example. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As the name indicates "Dragon Buster (<TWO::II>)..." as a sequel to Namco is "Dragon Buster". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Arcade original came out in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-FOUR::1984>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was a very simple early side-scrolling game, much like Campos "Pac-Man". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It moved around on a World Map, entered various caves and whatnot, slew dragons and other monsters. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Along with the Post "...Tower of Druaga" it was one of the earliest examples of a fantasy setting in Japanese video games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 A home version came out for the family in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And we now have a console-[only] sequel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So we have this nice little intro here, including a rather delightfully long text scroll. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Apparently the dragons row with a masterful heir, those arrogant bastards. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And of course, the chosen one will find the sword, kill a dragon, et cetera, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And his name is Carl. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the fact that a hero is named Carl is, sort of, made fun of on the internet, since the name doesn't really imply a 'Sword and Sorcery' hero. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He had kind of a different image I guess when you hear the name Karl. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Ever the guy from the original game was named Clovis, a Frankish King, so Karl is quite obviously a reference to Charlemagne, a.k.a. Karl Great. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now without having any instructions, the beginning might seem a bit unintuitive. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are a couple areas that you can enter To heart laser appears you can. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a big tree, cave, this church thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though walking up to the interest is and pressing the buttons does nothing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Can't walk around the cave so you can be stuck in this little area. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, so what the heck are you supposed to do? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, despite the fact that the A and the buttons are not used on this screen, for some reason you do actually hit the Select button to enter a dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yes, Select the most unloved button on the N.E.S. controller get some action here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Apparently a whole lot of guys enter this dungeon before you did and got killed because the ground is completely covered in schools. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And that's right, the servers that you are walking on is literally composed of human remains, which is absolutely disgusting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But the dungeons don't really seem that dangerous. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They are virtually devoid of enemies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, they're [pretty] much empty of everything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As enemies approach, you'll often hear a very loud annoying alarm, much like in "Cyborg thunder" which we saw in the last 'Chronsega'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Most enemies can be dispatched with just a couple arrows. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I don't know how so many people got killed... unless the cave is supposed to be some sort of gigantic disorganized mausoleum. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So killing a specific monster will provide the key to the exit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the exit takes the form of a teeny tiny little door. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 ProTip: Don't accidentally press the fire button thinking it'll let you open the door. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your arrow will bounce off-the-wall and kill you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now once you exit a dungeon, it disappears from the map and you can move onward. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is the entire game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 To clarify, you simply enter one dungeon after another, kill a monster, get a key, then repeat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 All the dungeons look alike except for the color and the pattern of the floor. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a very limited number of room shapes and each dungeon uses those exact same shapes over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some dungeons even appear to have the exact same layout. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Of course, the original "Dragon Buster" was, sort of, the same way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now I've heard this game referred to as a '...Zelda' clone but this is true [only] superficially. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Dragon Buster (<TWO::II>)..." really just "Dragon Buster (<ONE::I>)" with the side-scrolling viewpoint replaced with a top-down one. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And even 'Hardcore Gaming <ONE-O-ONE::101>' states the game there's nothing like the original. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But both games have almost identical structures. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You just move the camera on this <NINETY-DEGREES::90°> downwards and you basically got "Dragon Buster (<ONE::I>)". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The end result is, sort of, a boring game since it's so repetitive. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I should mention this was developed by tows us we can't really expect great things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, there are a few items you can pick up like flaming arrows, shields or fairies which can refill your health. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But there aren't any "...Zelda"-like special weapons or items or anything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The final dungeon on this level is the volcano thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is, once again, just like all the other dungeons [only] it's way bigger. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's just the same identical screens over and over again until you just, sort of, happen to stumble upon the rather 'dragon Plexi'-looking dragon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This guy is way tougher than the other Emmys and I got killed [pretty] quickly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though I'd say it's probably not really worth the effort to beat him and make it to the second level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's too bad but "Dragon Buster (<TWO::II>)" is a little on the lame side. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Taboo: The Sixth Sense 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tradewest 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, kids, it's time for some U.S.-[only] games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 First up is one from Tradewest, the Texas based publisher that put out "Double Dragon", "Battletoads", and from last episode, "John Elway Football". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But this game is no "Double Dragon". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nope. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's our second scarier Colt game, "Taboo: The Sixth Sense" no by Rare. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The music from David Wise is [pretty] good by the way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, it's the best thing about the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 No "Taboo..." is one of the more notorious titles for the N.E.S. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Part of the problem then maybe text like this: taboo Time Machine on Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 How is this game a time machine? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Fortune telling prophecy or whatever isn't time travel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So it's weird that this game is designed by people whose native language is English yet the text often doesn't make any sense. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some online reviewers even use the word English described taboo writing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And yet it was created by guys in Leicestershire for guys in Corsicana, Texas. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was a completely Western game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's where you enter your name, birthdate, and sex. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is utterly pointless and does nothing, as far as I know. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game is smart enough to stop you if you try to introduce an invalid birthday. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's the meat of the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You asked "Taboo" a question you want answered. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Typing out a question letter by letter using the D-Pad is not fun. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you want to erase the letter hit rub. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This, sort of, betrays the developers British origins, sansa racer is called (get this) a rubber in the U.K.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now if you go online you'll find every clever person on the internet makes this observation. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Taboo" is not a game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And that's correct; it's a Tarot Card Simulation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And that may have confused or disappointed kids back in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the viewers of 'Chrontendo' know better. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We've already seen a few Fortune-Telling Games on the Japanese FamiCom, such as the one with the cat piloting the flying saucer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So "Taboo..." is nothing too special. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 After this seizure-inducing shuffling screen, the game lays out some tarot cards and in terms of over one by one very slowly and display some explanation of the cards that sort of border on jibberish. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now this being Rare, the cards have to like revolve around and end up in a position that demonstrates Rare's love of perspective graphics. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The illustrations on each card are [pretty] dull and don't really have any of that kind of, like, old-fashioned charm that you see, like, on actual tarot card decks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But Rare did manage to squeeze in a little bit of <EIGHT::8>-bit nudity. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The lovers card showed some naked backsides. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this one might be a topless woman... I think? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess Nintendo of America really liked Rare love to get away with this kind of stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's a weird touch. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sometimes one of the son emblems on the back of the card turns into a skull. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Spooky! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The last card is the final outcome card, which I suppose should answer the question he wrote earlier, but doesn't really. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And then as a bonus, you get to pick lucky numbers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're supposed to select the state or province that you live in. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So hopefully live in the U.S. or Canada. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But even if you do, somewhat hilariously, [only] <TWENTY-FOUR::24> states out of <FIFTY::50> are listed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Taboo" is, sort of, unique in Rare's catalog, but people really shouldn't be that surprised. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, after all, this is during Rare's mercenary, period when they proved anything and everything for a variety of publishers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But the bottom line, it's a weird game and not really fun to play. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Adventures of Lolo 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL America 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The [only] other U.S. game we have today is a little bit different. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We start with this rather well done intro. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So from hell, it's the "Adventures of Lolo". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And you will, of course, instantly recognize this as an "Eggerland" game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We've seen several 'Eggerland' games on the FamiCom and F.D.S.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a rather a cute and charming Puzzle Game in which the protagonist, Lolo, navigates through a mini-roomed castle in order to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend, which is not really that original. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 To exit room he must collect number of heart icons while avoiding or moving enemies that also inhabit the room. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The games are all very well-designed and 'Eggerland' was perhaps the first great Puzzle Game series on Nintendo console. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So here's the first room - quite simple, just to one stationary enemy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now as I mentioned, "The Adventures of Lolo" came out in the U.S.-[only]. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well as you play it might notice all the rooms are quite familiar. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's because "Adventures of Lolo" isn't really an original game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's more like a greatest hits of the Japanese 'Eggerland' games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It compiles a selection of rooms from the earlier Japanese games into one new game for the U.S. market. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So there's really nothing here we haven't seen before. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oddly (in Japan how soon change the series title from 'Eggerland' to 'the Lolo')! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So the remaining games in the series would get you need us and Japanese releases under the 'Lolo' name. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fairytale 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 April 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Soft Pro 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Soft Pro 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We'll just finish things up with a three ile Japanese games all released on April <TWENTY-EIGHTH::28th> <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 F.D.S. games are becoming increasingly rare but here's one "Fairytale" by Soft Pro. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Musics not half bad. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Let's start the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, of course, the intro takes the form of a book of fairy tales. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Honestly, Soft Pro was yours at this time because this game has you battling hordes of pigs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yes, pigs are the enemy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As we know <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> saw waves and waves of Strategy Games at the FamiCom and this continues into <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "jingis Khan" was one of those epic grand Strategy-type Games and "Fairytale" is a good deal simpler. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It focuses just on military battles, though it does have "upon juku hero" appearance to it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The exact little Square's that your cursor moves around on are actually invisible. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 To the playing field looks a little more realistic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, I'll just let you guys know right up front: we've played this game before. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The developer, Soft Pro, released a game in March <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>, called "19 anointed saints". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He was one of the earlier games and the Military Strategy wave. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You might recall that I complained profusely about the weird battle scheme. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Rather than battles happening automatically, you had to fight them out by moving your units around on a separate map. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Fairytale" it uses this exact same system. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 When they land on the same space as an enemy a battle begins. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You then enter this special battle screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this is where the game drives me bonkers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Each turn you choose moves for your units. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can move, rotate, or attack; and once you're done, both sides will simultaneously carry out their actions. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This means you could attack a space where an enemy is and when everything starts moving, you'll find you're actually attacking an empty space because the enemy has just moved on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In other words, you need to basically aim not where the enemy is, but where they're going to be. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And since the computer, sort of, moves around randomly, that's really hard to predict. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That could be any number of spaces. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, the battle is just, sort of, tend to look like the combatants just were wandering around randomly firing empty spaces. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I don't have the patience to even finish one battle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I'm just going to go ahead and sign off on "Fairytale". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Holy Diver 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 April 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Irem 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Dear Irem, 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I would like to thank you for making "R-Type" and all those other great games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also, thanks to the guys from Irem who later went on to make "Metal Slug". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, regarding your <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> FamiCom game, "Holy Diver", I would like to tell you to go screw yourselves. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also, jump in a lake, pound sand, and take a long walk off a short pier. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Sincerely, 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Dr. Sparkle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, now that that's out of the way, "Holy Diver" - I rums "Castlevania" clone with the difference, namely that it is capriciously cruel and difficult. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here's the very beginning which doesn't seem that hard. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But right away and notice the guys with red hoods move really quickly and closing from on you from both sides. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the flying me is just to the upper right out of range of your attacks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's like a little preview of what's to come later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We've also got some "Castlevania"-like stairs made out of skulls and destructible blocks, which often hide health and magic refills. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now the game is start showing its true colors here, a few minutes into the first level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They've all fast moving flying enemies that sort of move in these parabolic arcs coming in from both directions, as well as the more powerful flying enemies which lead to jump up in order to hit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's actually quite easy life at this point very early in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But still so far not that bad. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first boss is a quite cool can giant troll thing and he's relatively easy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You, sort of, need to jump up and shoot him in the head. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I also love that cool snake, and skull, and crucifix thing in the background. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Everything about "Holy Diver" is well-designed and there's lots of really cool metal touches like the skulls here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And once you beat the boss your health repels (thank goodness) any Junior magic ability. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Level to introduce you to very common "Holy Diver" tactic - enemies apply above just hide your range but can still hit you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also lots of hits. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You'll need to use your newly increased power to cross them, which also freezes enemies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But don't get too excited; it [only] works on really naked me so these guys here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later enemies will be mostly unaffected. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Holy Diver" begins seriously ramping up the difficulty around this point. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That enemies clean to the ceiling and firing triple shots while mostly being out of reach. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Meanwhile, faster moving enemies come screaming at you and these guys all take multiple hits to kill. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the bats are in extreme pain this level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Even when they're low enough to hit you, they're completely invisible except during that very brief moment when they jump from one person to the other. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and then comes a super tough mini-Boss like enemy on top of things. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the real boss here is like this normal clump of roots. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Looks [pretty] cool and shoots multiple deadly projectiles, which if they don't kill, you will probably block your shots as you're trying to shoot the boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Luckily, there's a trick of you want to make this easy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you jump down and immediately start moving to the space behind the boss this will allow you to shoot him from behind without getting harmed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the thing about "Holy Diver" is that yeah, it's hard - right hard - not "Castlevania" hard, not "Mega Man" hard, but really hard. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And people make these lists about the hardest and N.E.S. games and they put stuff like "Contra" "Archangel Gaiden" on them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and those games are tough, but "Holy Diver" is sadistic. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I think the main issue is there quickly multiple domains with different attack patterns are coming at you at one time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Like here: We have this bat on the ceiling which is tricky to kill. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But then these flying fish things will come at you and they take like a lot of hits before they go down. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the bat showers down the fireballs and the fish shoots smaller fish. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Look how many hits it takes to kill this thing! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the fish often quickly charges you and hits you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I mean seriously, once we reach level three, every single-screen becomes like a little mini-Boss fight... where one mistake can get you killed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And every level seems to ramp up the difficulty even more. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's [only] six levels long but around level four it's hard for us think breaching impossible status. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And just like "Ninja Gaiden" you can easily get knocked back onto a bottomless pit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But even more so than "Ninja Gaiden" "Holy Diver" just never lets up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 What you don't want to manage to defeat one really tough enemy then there's a next screen and there's another and another. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And just keeps going like that unrelentingly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Like here, you try to land on those little columns, and enemies just appear out of nowhere. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then there's these boulders? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And these guys? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They show up over and over again and each one takes <twelve::12> hits to kill, all the while spitting out a constant stream of projectiles. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And their shots go all the way across the screen while you can [only] reach a little bit further than belmonts clip. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And of course, we have various magic that'll be more powerful attacks, but these use of Magic Points very quickly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As you probably know, fully divert the game is named after the DLP and song of the same name. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The designer threw in various references to the metal acts. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your heroes name is Randy (currently referenced to Randy Rhoads) and the credits mentioned zakk Wylde. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 No, I do admit The game is cool. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's well-made has good graphics and sound. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It would be really enjoyable If [only] it weren't so soul crushingly difficult. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's possible to defeat the game, but this requires a lot of memorization and language magic to use in each situation. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And since your magic is limited you may hesitate to use it unless you know there's a refill coming up soon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At least the game gives you unlimited continues. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I've never played this game before now but I suppose a little bit of practice it is, in fact, beatable. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here using the blizzard power will freeze those little guys and stop them from knocking into a bottomless pit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But you still have to contend with these columns which takes so many hits to kill. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And after take care of this gone you think 'oh god what an ordeal but it's over' and then more Gollum. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As a rule, every time you encounter a tough enemy like this and think 'Oh god, it's finally over.', it just turns out to be like a regular enemy start encountering in every single room. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 By the end of this level, you get one of the all time worst video game bosses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This revolt column constantly shoots projectiles at you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The overdrive magic will protect you a little bit from some of the projectiles. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the problem is is that getting hit will knock you back and unavoidably cause you to fall to your death. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In other words, getting hit once will kill you... unless you're positioned on the very edge of the platform, in which case getting hit will actually cause you to almost fall to your death and land on the very other side of the platform. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But of course, jumping over a projectile will sometimes lead you to get hit in midair, and (you guessed it) fall to your death. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So should you miraculously survive this encounter, you'll get the thunder weapon which kills most enemies on screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, of course, the really tough ones that you want to kill using thunder. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And also drains your magic very, very quickly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One great thing about the game design is lit with special magical powers are actually useful and packed happy used in order to make progress. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The negative side of this is late in the game, you constantly have to switch back and forth and the powers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In lava lakes mean that you'll need to use blue. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Meanwhile, same time and these are flying around overhead require the Twin Shot to easily take out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then you can [only] be killed by overdrive or thunder. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, "Holy Diver" is so relentless, it gets tiresome. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The final two levels are so long and difficult that eventually it wore me down. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I didn't finish the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Probably not a whole lot of people have. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Holy Diver" is in many ways, a fantastic Action Platformer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But in other ways, it just bites. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I mean, go ahead and try it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And about halfway through be prepared to this question your dedication to actually playing this thing. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Keiba Simulation: Honmei 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 April 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nichibutsu 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Our last game today also from April <TWENTY-EIGHTH::28th> is "Keiba Simulation: Honmei" - 'Keiba' being the Japanese term for horse racing and 'honmei', I think, is as a racing term, meaning 'the winner of a race'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is published by Nihan Busson, a.k.a. Nietzsche booty. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is the second Horse Racing Game we've seen, the first being named post "Valley Jockey". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But that was more of a Horse Racing Gambling Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is more of a God Game in which he's had the terms of the horse race and see who the winner is there's no gambling involved. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's the menu screen, top categories for the racing options and the second is for the horses option. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are actually a lot of options to control. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I suppose you could say that this game is deep in that sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You can set the length of the race, the weather, that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So nice details emerge here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The pointer is a carrot and every page has these cute illustrations with the race horses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are even more options for the horses themselves - about three pages worth. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I tried to fool around a bit, making one horse really old and giving him bad health and what I thought was a heavy jockey just to see how this would affect his performance. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this part is more or less the meat of the game, fiddling around with all the numbers and then seeing what happens. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once you're ready, go to the final option and the race will begin. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And they're off! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now at this point, remember that Cuba simulation is a Simulation Game, not a Racing Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have no control over the races. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You just sit here and watch the horses slowly run around the track. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Just sit here doing nothing for a few minutes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This reminds me of a way earlier game, "Breeder", from Soft Pro - same guy said "Fairytale". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is, sort of, control the stats and, sort of, watch it play itself. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Of course, "Keiba Simulation..." is a much slicker game than "Breeder" which is so terrible it made the 'Chrontendo' "Worse <Ten::10> Games list". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so finally! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the weird thing is I had thought I had seriously GIMP towards number one and Harry came in fifth. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, who knows? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't really know that much about horse racing in real life either! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 44 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so I'm going to make a choice for this episode's best game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a few contenders, but ultimately it has to be "River City Ransom". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a fun well-crafted game that sticks out from all the other Beat-'em-Ups released at this time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 For a runner up, I'd say "Holy Diver". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's such a high-quality game on so many levels. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If [only] Irem wasn't such a big dick about making it impossible to finish. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Worst Game is... I don't know. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 All say "Mindseeker". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's less entertaining than "We could Garfield". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And it lends an air of legitimacy to a con artists like Massey Waukee keota. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So "Mindseeker", you get the brown metal today. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Up next, we move back to the <fifteen::15> games per episode format. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Will be seen another Nintendo Adventure Game and a popular license game from Konami that a lot of people really hate. 🍇
