👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 11 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hello, and welcome to "Chrontendo Episode 11" and I am Dr. Sparkle, your host. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, you know what? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think we actually have a [pretty] good selection of games this episode. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We're smack in the middle of autumn 1986, and this episode, we have a really classic game from Konami as well as a [pretty] good game from Capcom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've got interesting new titles from Hudson and from Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We have a [pretty] good, uh, Shoot-'em-Up this episode and a Text Adventure Game and even some kind of *oddball* games! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, let's get started! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 I am a Teacher: Teami no Kiso 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 26 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Royal Kougyou
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Chrontendo Episode 10" is [another] one [of] those episodes where one game really seems [to] stand heads and tails above all the rest. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And no, this is not *that* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is "I am a Teacher: [Teami] no [Kiso]". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, as you can plainly see, this is also a knitting instructional game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, we really shouldn't call it a game; it's merely an instructional F.D.S. disk. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once again, you pick a sweater, put in the measurements, it'll actually tell ya how much yarn ya need [to] buy, and then you can see how to actually make the, uh -- the [various little] loops and whatnot using the *knitting* needles. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm really not quite sure what the idea behind this disk *was*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It seems that learning how [to] knit might be easier from a book or something like that or taking knitting classes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess if you were feeling, sort of, modern [and] contemporary and didn't wanna learn something [from] {a} book, you could [have] bought this thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I assume this is, sort of, marketed towards, uh, housewives and whatnot. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess "I am a Teacher..." is [pretty] typical [of] some [of] the sort of, strange stuff we'll be seeing for the F.D.S.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, this was the second and last of Royal Kougyou's games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting, uh, there's no Nintendo characters in this one, but it's still copyrighted to Nintendo, which raises the possibility that Nintendo themselves may have actually developed this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One nice feature - it seems [that it] actually allows you to save the projects that you're working on. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess this game might be fun for fans of hot knitting action. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Anybody else (people who don't knit or [aren't into] instructional disks), I guess perhaps, uh, this is not really the game for you. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Akumajo Dracula 🇯🇵 // Castlevania 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 26 🇯🇵 // 1987 May [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, admittedly, that first game wasn't very impressive, but this one is a lot better! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's "Akumajo Dracula", better known in the U.S. as "Castlevania". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the F.D.S. version where you can actually save your game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And note that weird little, uh, skull with the bloody nail through the eye. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That [particular] screen does not exist in the Western version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I believe there were a few minor details that were censored for the release of "Castlevania" in the US. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the more familiar U.S. title screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And we get this very spooky atmospheric opening cutscene here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this game, you play Simon Belmont, Vampire Hunter extraordinaire, off to settle a score with *Dracula*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You're armed with this famed whip, known as the Vampire Killer, but apparently, it can't be *that* great because you almost *immediately* ditch it for some other weapon you find [just] laying around in the *graveyard*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If you've never *played* "Castlevania" [before], well, please be aware it's a great *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Graphically, this is almost certainly the most impressive-looking game we've seen on the FamiCom, *so* far. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is one [of] the few games [that] really managed to [use] -- to create, like, a real kind of spooky atmosphere. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *music* is also very effective. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the famous Vampire Killer theme music being played on this level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The Platformer was rapidly becoming one [of] the more [popular] genres on the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Ever since "...Mario Bros.", we haven't really seen a whole lot of really great Platformers, [and] this is really certainly *one* of them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Compared to a lot of the other games we've been seeing that are similar [to] this, this one really is, sort of, [head] and shoulders above the rest. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As we saw there, you will need to break apart the occasional wall [to] find some sort of hidden item. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In that case, it was a turkey, which will give you some additional health. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Why there's a turkey hidden in the castle wall is anybody's guess. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... I expect it probably certainly wouldn't be *fresh*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You also whip the various *candlestick* holders in order [to] get hearts. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, hearts don't refill your health, despite what ya might think; they actually refill your secondary weapon meter. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Every time you grab a heart, that's one time you can use your secondary weapon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this case, it's the little dagger that appears here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this game consists of either six or seven levels (depending on if you count the -- the Boss, uh, Dracula's Chamber as a Final Level). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is the end [of] first one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 At the end of every level, there is a boss of some sort; in this case, it's a relatively easy vampire bat. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game actually ramps up the difficulty of the bosses reasonably gently, [so] you're not going to be, uh, te... -- be, uh, too frustrated when you face this First Boss, especially if you have the right secondary weapon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And a concept that was later used in "Mega Man": having the right secondary weapon [will] make certain bosses go a lot easier, with the exception of, uh, the first form of Dracula himself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the game is nice enough to refill your Health Bar after you're done with a boss, unlike a certain other game, which we'll see later {in} this episode. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Because this first level is relatively easy, ya might be, sort of, lured into a false sense [of] security [that] this is not a difficult game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But actually, it does get difficult, especially in the later levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, [you] have three lives, and infinite continues. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] certainly some issues that make this game a bit more difficult than it would be. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, whenever [an] enemy hits you, you actually [get] knocked back [a little] bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This can be very dangerous when around these levels where ya [can] fall [to] your death very easily. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Certain enemies, such as those Medusa Heads and these Hunchbacks, can be notoriously difficult to actually hit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They tend [to] move around in patterns that make them, sort of, difficult; like, the Hunchbacks usually land either right behind you or right [in front] of you and then run forward and smack [into] you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, when you jump, you [can't] change your character's direction in mid-jump. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] other words, if you jump and suddenly an enemy appears, you [will] often smack right [into] them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Staircases [can] also be a bit tricky. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can [only] whip directly in [front] of you, so you can't really attack enemies that [are] above or below you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And also, it's quite easy to [accidentally] fall off a staircase [and] fall to your death if you're not careful. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In later levels of the game, every single hit takes off a [pretty] good chunk in your Life Bar, and healing items are [pretty] scarce. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There is the occasional chunk of beef or turkey wing hidden in the wall, but they *really* don't happen that frequently. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a rather effective secondary weapon, a stopwatch that'll allow you [to] temporarily freeze all the enemies on a screen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 At any rate, in later games in the series, your character became a lot easier to control. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So that's] led s... -- some people [to] categorize this first game as perhaps having, sort of, bad controls. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] that's really not the case at all. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I mean], if you've compared some [of] the other games, uh, [that we've] played [to] this one, you'll see [the] ar... -- controls are actually very good. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the Frankenstein Boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He [can] be a bit tricky [if] ya don't have a Holy Water, which will temporarily freeze [an] enemy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is one [of] the coolest looking levels [in] the game, the Clock Tower level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We're getting quite close, here, [to] Dracula. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, seriously, compare this to some earlier Platformers (I mean ones that came out, I mean, just like a month or so before this - say "Musashi no Ken") and you'll *really* see how much better this game looks in comparison. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] really very few games that attempt [to] put [so] much time, effort, [and] detail [into] the way a game looks. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Finally, we come [to] Dracula, himself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He [can] g... -- be a bit tricky, because you can [only] hit [him] directly in the face [and only] for a very brief second [before he] disappears. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He also tends [to] materialize [right] on top of you and throw fireballs at you as well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, [with] a few tries, you can get through the guy; [he's] definitely not impossible. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [he] does {have} a second form, which is actually a bit easier, [because] you [can] use the Holy Water on [him]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya know, looking at this game in the context of what else [is coming] out [at] around this time, you *really* have to hand it [to Konami]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Out] of the -- all the major Arcade manufacturers, Konami was really the one who seemed to understand what the FamiCom was all about. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Remember, at this stage, Taito was mostly releasing just Arcade ports [and] mediocre original games like "Musashi no Ken". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Namco was maybe doing a *little* bit better, but *really* nothing even close [to] the level of something like *this*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The fact that Konami released "Castlevania", "...Goonies", and "Ganbare Goemon!..." all within [such a] short period of time really indicates that they understood where the FamiCom was going. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of all the third-party developers making games [for] the FamiCom, really [only] Konami and Hudson Soft seem [to] be dedicated {to} turning out quality games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, at this stage here, I've defeated Dracula, and now the castle [will] collapse [into] the ground, which is probably not a good thing because (as far as I can tell) I'm still in it, right? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm surprised Simon wasn't *killed* when the whole thing came crashing *down* like that. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, needless to say, "Castlevania" was {a} success in Japan, and it was released in the United States as well as Europe. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this was the first in a long series of games, which is actually still around *today*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This series would change over the years, but, uh, the games would remain [pretty] consistently good, with the entries for the PC Engine and the PlayStation being considered [to] be all-time classics. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And then, of course, we get these ridiculous closing credits with all these, uh, fake names. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Much [has] been made about the, uh, hero's name appearing as Simon Belmondo in the credits. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps some people thought that maybe the name was changed for the final release. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, I assume that's actually, uh, just, sort of, a little joke in reference to the French actor, Jean-Paul Belmondo, who's, uh, [pretty] well-known - (at least up un... -- through the, uh, '70s and '80s). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe he was still [popular] in Japan at this time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, in closing, "Castlevania" - not the best game in the series, but still [an] awesome game, and, uh, let's hope that more games [on] the FamiCom [will] be able [to] live up [to] this standard. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Senjou no Ookami 🇯🇵 // Commando 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 27 🇯🇵 // 1986 November [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Released one day after "Akumajō Dracula" was Capcom's "Senjou no Ookami" (known in the West as "Commando"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is based on Capcom's enormously successful 1985 Arcade Game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The basic concept for "Commando" was taken from an earlier game called "Front Line" (the FamiCom port of which was discussed several episodes ago). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, Capcom's game was much superior to the earlier "Front Line" - and [pretty] much popularized the entire vertically scrolling 'one or two men versus an entire army' genre. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The objective of this game is to destroy a series of enemy bases in some sort of unspecified enemy country and rescue P.O.W.s while you're at it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The very cool Japanese title translates into 'Wolf of the Battlefield'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The English title was [presumably inspired] by the 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, "Commando", even though the game is not actually related [to] that film. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In "Commando", you control the small blue soldier who's armed with a machine gun against countless enemy soldiers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Commando" is not an easy game; the Arcade version is known for being [pretty] difficult. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is a 'one-hit: you get killed' game; there's no Life Bar [or] anything like that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Since you're often surrounded by enemies, being hit [can -- is] actually quite simple. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, the enemy soldiers are not very smart and often, uh, run away from you or [do] not fire at you when they're quite close. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise, the game would be virtually impossible. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, you'll come [across] another soldier in blue; that's one of the P.O.W.s. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing about "Commando" is the previous Capcom games were ported [to the] FamiCom in a somewhat shoddy fashion by Micronics. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Commando" is the first FamiCom Capcom game to actually be ported by Capcom themselves. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess this is, sort of, Capcom's official entry [into] the world of console *games*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 How does it actually turn out? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, certainly it's a lot better than *"SonSon"*, but perhaps not [as] good [as] you might *hope*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is reasonably accurate to the Arcade version but is still slightly ugly-looking. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Incidentally, this is, sort of, almost like the first boss battle here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's no real boss, but you do [have to] face an extraordinary number of enemy soldiers [that] keep pouring out at you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing that Capcom did do for this port is they -- [they did add] a few features, such as hidden areas. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [If] you'd throw a grenade right there, you [can] go down [into] a little underground passage and find some POWs - as well as some extra grenades. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When I first [saw] this, I thought, "Well... Are these, uh -- What are these guys doing? 🍇🍊🍓 It looks like they're going to the bathroom or something.". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But no, they're actually facing forwards with their hands tied behind their backs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They have no faces, making that somewhat difficult [to] distinguish. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, you actually run in, touch them, [and] free them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, Capcom would eventually become quite well-known for making a lot of changes and enhancing the home versions of their Arcade games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 While the changes in "Commando" are quite minor, ya [can] see that Capcom is embarking on the path [that] would lead [to] games like "Bionic Commando" much later. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 People who [are] quite familiar with the Arcade version might find the FamiCom version [to] be a little strange. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The controls are actually quite a bit different, switching from a joystick (which can kinda be swung around) to a D-Pad. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The actual gameplay feel is *substantially* different. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, once you get the hang of it, it becomes quite a bit easier. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, here I've destroyed the Final Base. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... {I} don't know why those flames are purple. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] like the little hearts in the 'Congratulations' message. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Then the helicopter picks you up and starts you all over again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [So, I'm] gonna say [that] "Commando" is a [pretty] good game, once you get the hang of it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I was somewhat skeptical of the home version of "Commando", at first. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There's actually countless bad home conversions of this for various computers and whatnot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But the Nintendo one is certainly the best. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once I, sort of, got the hang [of] the controls, I [found] it [to be actually] {a} very enjoyable and playable game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Terra Cresta 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 27 🇯🇵 // 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nihon Bussan
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nihon Bussan 🇯🇵 // VIC TOKAI 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is a game that was released the same day, as "Commando". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's "Terra Cresta" from Nichibutsu! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game was originally for the Arcades in 1985. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, as ya might recall, Nichibutsu were also the guys who made "MagMax". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Terra Cresta" resembles "MagMax", in [that] you go around picking up ship parts, which [can be] added to your craft and [will] make you more powerful. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These are basically the power-ups [of] the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, these [extra] ship parts will [act] as a buffer when you're hit. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I believe [Nichibutsu] ported this game [to] the FamiCom themselves, and they did a [pretty] good job. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though the first thing ya might think when ya see [this] is, 'Hey, it looks just like "Commando"!' (at least the background does). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They've used the same, sort of, orangish color for the ground. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I guess] that was [sort of] becoming the default ground color, uh, for the sort of, FamiCom, which had limited color palette. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! I just picked up the first part. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another minor graphical difference is the [dinosaurs do] not move [at] all in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... In the Arcade version, they slowly inch forward. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Terra Cresta" is one [of] those somewhat simple Shooters in the sense ya [only] have one Fire button - [and] really [only] one method of Fire. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's no bombs [or] anything like this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You actually destroy things on the ground simply by shooting them [with] your regular [laser]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [of] course, I [can], uh, shoot both forward and behind [as] well [as having some kind] of extra little additional laser-type thing, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, one [of] the cool things [about] this game is once you get all the parts, you actually temporarily transform into a giant Phoenix. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Here's the First Boss.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, you're always, sort of, I mean, that's kind of, like, your main goal is [to] get [to], sort of, see yourself transform [into the] Phoenix. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... I'm not sure how many levels there are. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I've not actually played this game all the way through [to] the end. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! [And] here we [go]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So, you're] temporarily indestructible and able to kill enemies just by touching them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And that's kind of the cool part [of] the game, right there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But the whole thing is [pretty] good! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Perhaps, not the best Shooter [that's] ever come out, but certainly, um, a lot better [than] many [of] the things that we've been seeing for [the] FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So, I've got to say], this is actually a [pretty] good game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Buggy Popper 🇯🇵 // Bump 'n' Jump 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 October 08 🇯🇵 // 1988 December [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 // VIC TOKAI 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 From Data East, we now have another port of an antique Arcade game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [First of] all, notice how *ugly* this *title* screen is (not [to] mention the fact there is no music). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yes, this is "Buggy Popper", released in the U.S. [as] "Bump 'n' Jump". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a port of the 1982 Data East Arcade Game, "Bump 'n' Jump" ([otherwise] known as "Burnin' Rubber"). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, I will confess, as a very young person, I do remember this game in the arcades [and] enjoyed [it] quite a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I think maybe it had something [to] do with the uniqueness of the gameplay [and] the rather interesting-looking enemy cars [that] were on the screen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom version changed the graphics a bit and adds a new feature - namely fuel. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] fuel canisters you [have to] pick up in the middle of the road. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [story] behind this game is [that]... well, you know, once again, your girlfriend has [been] kidnapped, and ya have [to] rescue [her]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Apparently, this is an excuse to go out on the freeway and commit massive vehicular homicide. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That part [of] the game is actually a bit puzzling. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, certainly not every single guy on the road [can] be [an] enemy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We must assume that [since it's] a public freeway; [at] least [most] {of} the people are innocent bystanders. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Why [do ya] get points for killing every single person on the road? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, luckily, you're equipped with a very special vehicle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a buggy of some [sort that can] actually propel itself up in the air, towards the viewer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then it can land on top of enemy cars, as well as jump over the rather large gaps in the freeway that appear. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Which raises another question: Why [does this] freeway have [such] big chunks missing [out] of it? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Is this unfinished? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If so, why are [they] letting [people] drive on it? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess we really shouldn't expect logic from a video game, but this game does seem [pretty] odd. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, about the FamiCom version, yeah, it's okay. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess it, sort of, plays like the original Arcade version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, I think a lot of the charm has been lost in the conversion. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The vehicles [don't] really look anything like they did in the Arcade game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe I'm just being nostalgic [for] the original version, but this game [just] seems [to] be somehow lacking [to] me. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game did get a U.S. [release] in 1988 by Vic Tokai. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Why [did] they release this game so late? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I really [don't] *know*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game had been ported many times [before], even as far back as on the 2600. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess Vic Tokai just didn't have anything *better* [to] put out! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Othello 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 October 13 🇯🇵 // 1988 December [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kawada 🇯🇵 // Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And here's another F.D.S. title. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess we'll take a break from Arcade ports for a little bit and look at an original game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is *"Othello"* - released by the mysterious *Kawada*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I really have no idea who these guys *are*, [and] I don't know [if] they [released] any other *games*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The title screen, here, also credits Tsukuda. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They are the Japanese company that actually manufactured the 'Othello' board games and has the name 'Othello' copyrighted. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, first of all, you choose your difficulty, and ya choose your color, and you put in [your] name, and then you're ready [to] play 'Othello'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game was [pretty] popular] back in the '70s and '80s. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] actually, uh -- The idea is [pretty] old. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [have] been other board games similar [to] this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though really, it's the -- the modern Japanese version {of} 'Othello' that's played mostly, nowadays. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In this case, I am white, and you [can] place [your] piece on the board so [that] you have two pieces surrounding one of the opponent's pieces. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you do this, then the opponent's pieces flip over. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you can't find a place where ya can flip an opponent's piece, you then have to forfeit your turn. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Othello" is sort of a weird game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... For those who remember the b... -- game [that] came out [in] the '70s in the US, the motto on the box was 'a minute [to] learn...a lifetime [to] master'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And yes, the rules [are] very simple, but actually winning a game is [not] so simple. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Especially against [the] computer because, uh, it's actually not very hard to make [a] computer program that'll beat actually any Oth... -- human 'Othello' player on Earth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike games like 'Chess', [or] 'Go', a computer [can pretty] much easily [defeat] a human being. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When you play this game, don't be fooled [into] thinking that just because you [have] more pieces on the board than your opponent [that] you're actually winning. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Things [can] actually turn around quite quickly, [at] the end [of] the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, uh, during the end [of] the game, you'll see massive numbers of pieces changing color [constantly]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I think really one [of] the best strategies ([and this is] what the computer *seems* [to] do) is [to] make diagonal rows of pieces which head towards the corners. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you are new [to] the game [of] 'Othello' [and] ya try playing this computer program, um, you'll [probably] get [your] ass handed [to] you [pretty easily]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 A couple interesting things about this game: 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This [was] released [for] the F.D.S., but it was [released] on cartridge *[only]* around a month *later*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Something else that's noteworthy is [this is] the first *FamiCom* game (at least I *believe* it is), uh, [developed] by HAL Laboratory. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 HAL [would] eventually get very close ties to Nintendo, becoming, sort of, a second-party developer for Nintendo - making games like the 'Kirby' games and "[Super] Smash Bros.". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, the current president of Nintendo was actually the ex-president of HAL. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They actually started publishing games themselves in December of '86, so we'll be seeing a lot more of them. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pro Wrestling: FamiCom Wrestling Association 🇯🇵 // Pro Wrestling 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 October 21 🇯🇵 // 1987 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And... we have another FamiCom Disk System game from Nintendo themselves, known in the U.S. as "Pro Wrestling", and known in Japan as "Pro Wrestling: FamiCom Wrestling Association". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is actually the third Wrestling Game for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, by the way, here on the introduction, we see the [sort of, various], uh, characters introduced... and they're all playable. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The first Wrestling Game was, of course, the, uh, 'Kinnikuman' game, known as "MUSCLE" in the US. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} second one was "Tag Team Wrestling". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [then] we [have] this one, which is actually, far and away, the best {of} the [three]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm controlling Fighter Hayabusa there; he's, sorta, the normal-looking guy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Star Man, which is, sorta, the mysterious, uh, alien wrestler dude. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this actually works relatively similar to "Tag Team Wrestling". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One button controls punches; [the] other controls kicks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The kicks are much more effective. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Most effectively, however, if you walk up to an opponent and hit the *punch* button, you will go into a *grapple*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you're in the grapple, hitting a certain button combination will perform some sort of special move. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These moves are usually some kind of throw or a slam [or] *something* like that. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While your opponent is down, you [can], uh, grab them [in] the head, you can jump on them, and, of course, you [can] pin an opponent. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So while, in theory, this really isn't that different than "Tag Team Wrestling", the actual execution is *quite* a lot better. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the players are a lot of fun; ya, sort of, have, uh -- each player has its own special move. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Like I just did the, uh, the Brain Kick, there, that Fighter Hayabusa has - which unfortunately misses much more than [it] actually connects. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, I'd say, of all the characters, he's perhaps, in *some* ways, the worst. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some [of the] other, uh, unique fighter moves are much more effective. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the kick is actually [pretty] effective as well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can run and do, like, a -- try [to] do, like, a clothesline or something, but I [have] a hard time getting this [to] actually work ([to actually] connect with the other guy). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And [this] game is well-loved for (among other things), the famous 'A WINNER IS YOU' screen after you've actually won a match. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once ya win one match, ya then go on [to] the next fighter and so on, until ya [become] the champion! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess the actual structure [of] the game is similar to, uh, "Punch-Out" which, of course, had [not yet] come [out for] the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] yeah, you [can] throw your opponents against the ropes, smash into 'em, throw your opponent [out of] the ring... 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, I'm fighting as one [of] the more, uh, crazy creatures: The Amazon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He has a few crazy moves up his sleeve. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] really hard [to] say *why* the FamiCom had three Wrestling Games, {at} this point. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There was one Baseball Game, one Golf Game, [only] a couple Mahjong Games, {and} no Boxing Games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Why so many Wrestling Games? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I don't know; I guess [it's] just sorta the way it worked out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Wrestling was, of course, [pretty] popular in] Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing I actually wish this game had was some sort of Health or Life Meter because you really don't know [how] much damage is being done, uh, [to] you, as compared [to] the other guy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, there I [just did] one [of] my special moves, as The Amazon. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And here's another, uh, one [of] the wrestlers; he [has], like, a head butt move, which is [actually pretty] cool. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And that's actually [pretty] effective. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once again, "Pro Wrestling" - [this is] the first quality Wrestling Game [we've] seen the F... -- for the FamiCom and definitely the one ya wanna play. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Urusei Yatsura: Lum no Wedding Bell 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 October 23 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The last time we heard from Jaleco was with "Jajamaru no Daibouken". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And here we have another game from them that unfortunately is not quite [as] fun. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is called "Urusei Yatsura: Lum no Wedding Bell" [and it] is based on a licensed property - namely the popular anime and manga, 'Urusei Yatsura'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One of the extremely odd things about this game - [it] was also [released] in an Arcade version (same year - 1986), but the Arcade version was "Momoko 120%". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Apparently, they had the rights for the 'Urusei...' license on the FamiCom version, [but the] -- they could not use [them] for the Arcade version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, they changed the Arcade game [to], like, this -- this completely generic character, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Why the game is called "Momoko 120%", I'm really not sure. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In this game, you play one [of] the main characters of the manga; that's Lum. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 She's an alien being with little horns on [her] head and apparently [can] throw lightning bolts. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, for some reason, um, your school [is] always on *fire*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game starts off in what I assume is preschool, then moves on to Elementary School, Junior High, {and} so on {and} so forth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It ends [with] you actually getting married (hence the name). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The object of each level is to use the escalators (or, ya know, uh, sometimes [there's] trampolines) [to] get [onto] the roof [of] the school and then escape in your UFO. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you do not do this quickly enough, you [will] burn in the fire which is rag... -- raging in the basement. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... As I mentioned, this game is really not that fun. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One of the issues [with] -- that I find with this game is simply the fact that you're [pretty] much, uh, being spammed by enemies at all [times]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] sometimes difficult [to] move forward because there [are constantly] enemies coming your way, and all you have is this [ridiculous little] lightning bolt to fend them off with. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here we see, uh, the between-level cutscene. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your character grows up a little bit and now on [to] the next grade. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, sometimes you find yourself needing to jump [across] a gap but being unable to, simply because there's too many enemies coming towards you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] especially true when you have [to] use little hand bars to cross a gap because you [can't] fire. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes there's, like, a never-ending row of enemies; you [can] zap them with your lightning, but since they don't actually stop coming, ya [have] a difficult time crossing the gap in time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And also, quite frankly, [it is] rather difficult [to] hit [anything] with your lightning bolt. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The enemies often fly too high [to] be hit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That was one [of] the Bonus Rounds, right there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Altogether, there are six levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's, uh, four grades of... (Whoops! I fell [into] the fire, there.) ...four grades [of] school. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, I'm in Junior High. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] some reason, guys in little black suits start appearing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, [and] then there's those horrible cat things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, [so, you know], sometimes they actually fall on you, [while you're] in the middle of making a jump. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Jaleco [has] a [pretty] mixed record when it comes to FamiCom games so far. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this one is [probably] goin' [to] be, in my opinion, one of the least interesting games they've come up with. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Oh, see once again, ya see the problem of never getting an opportunity [to] actually jump across [that] gap, there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [I'd] say, [sort] of, stay away [from] this one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It might be interesting if [you're] {a} fan of the series, but, uh, other [than] that, there's [probably] really no reason [to] play this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sansū 4, 5+6-nen: Keisan Game (actually two separate releases) 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 October 30 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?]
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tokyo Shoseki 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh boy! It's time for more educational games! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These [are] the next two cartridges released by Tokyo Shoseki, the Japanese textbook publisher. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first one covers *4th* Grade, and the second covers 5th and 6th grade. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, [for] those [who] need a reminder, these [are], sorta, the follow-ups to "Sansū 1...", "...2...", [and] "...3 Toshi". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, compared [to] *those* three games, these [are] actually a [bit] of a rip-off. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Instead of four games per cartridge, you [only] get *two*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or rather ya get four, but, uh, they're repeated. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There're several variations on the same game on ea... on each cartridge. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, very oddly, number 5 & 6 has a rather non-[educational]-looking and rather dull [Horizontal] Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The other game on this title is, [sort of], like, a game where ya have [to] go around spraying, uh, garden [pests] with bug spray. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess there's nothing like teaching, uh, environmentally friendly values [to] kids [at] a young age. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, just like the first three, these really have no gaming value and [are only] of interest to obsessives, like myself. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mississippi Satsujin Jiken: Murder on the Mississippi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 October 31 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Activision | Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the last game released in October of 1986 is "Mississippi Satsujin Jiken..." (or 'Mississippi Murder Case'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya might notice the Activision copyright there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a port of their game originally [for] the Commodore 64! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And this game is a Text Adventure-style game, but [not] the same kind of Adventure Game that "Portopia..." was. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] a sort of distinctively American brand. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] believe the first game [that] kind of invented this [particular] sub-genre was "King's Quest". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Basically, you actually control a, uh, character [that] you can move around [and] then grab objects, talk [to] people, that [sort of] thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As opposed to a game like "Portopia...", which is strictly, ya know, a static illustration and then, uh, completely text-based. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In this game, you play an amateur detective who investigates a, uh, murder that occurred on the riverboat. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can go into different] people's rooms, talk [to] people there, uh, look around, look for clues, find items... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's, like, commands like, for example, there's the 'Move' command, which allows ya [to start] moving again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] there's, like, the 'Look' command [and] when ya come across a person, [there's], like, a 'Talk' command, and, like, another menu will open up - like, 'Whadda ya wanna talk about?'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] actually plays, sorta, [similarly to] "Portopia...". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess, around this time, Activision suddenly realized [that] there [was] a lucrative Japanese market [for] video games because we have the licensed property of 'Pitfall!', which came out with, uh, "Super Pitfall". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then there was this game, and then there [was] -- of course, was "Ghostbusters" as well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! I've actually discovered the, uh, corpse here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The credits [for] the U.S. version say it was created by Adam Bellin, who is a, uh, developer [at] Activision who [helped design] the game, "Ghostbusters". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Apparently, [he] did the music for [it]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And this game was prod... -- (at least the original Commodore 64 version) was produced by Brad Fregger, who [also] produced, uh, "Pitfall II..." and "Ghostbusters". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, uh, all these games seem [to] have something in common. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Here we're going to question a, uh, [possible] witness or suspect, ask [her] what [she knows about] the dead man. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing that's different about this game from "Portopia..." is [it's] actually possible to *lose*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can get] *killed* in the game (as we'll see here, [in] just [a] moment, when a knife hits me)! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this is certainly really not a bad game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [pretty] typical of Adventure Games of this [particular] era. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [However], if ya do wanna play this, ya might be better off playing the Commodore 64 version because it's in English - and the games are really quite similar. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ginga Denshou: Galaxy Odyssey 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 06 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Wave Jack
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Imagineer 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This [is] another F.D.S. game, and, as you *probably noticed*, they're coming [out] quite frequently! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is actually the fourth one, this episode! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, quite a bit [has] changed since -- from back when they [were only] coming out, like, one game every two months. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is "Ginga Denshou: Galaxy Odyssey". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is a rather curious little game! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You might remember the [Shoot]-'em-Up, "Galg", from a while ago. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That was, uh, considered [to] be, sort of, a Shoot-'em-Up R.P.G.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, this is actually something quite similar! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess [you might picture] this game as [sort] of being a cross [between] a Shoot-'em-Up and "...Zelda"! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This was the first game [for] the FamiCom, from a publisher called Imagineer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... They're actually a [pretty] prolific publisher of no [particular] speciality. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Over the years, they've [released] things like the 'Sims' games in Japan, the 'Madden Football' games, and, of course, a [lot] of original games, as well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... I believe this is actually developed by a company called Wave Jack - about which I really don't know much. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I couldn't find very many other games they developed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing you'll [probably] instantly pick up on is - the enemies here take multiple hits [to] kill! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That is, uh, some sort of violation of a unspoken rule in Shoot-'em-Ups - is that, uh, there [don't] seem [to] be any one-hit-kill enemies in this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, whenever you hit something, you tend [to] pick up, uh, two different types of capsules. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The small ones are energy ([or] maybe oxygen), and the larger ones [are] actually money! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, those energy capsules (or oxygen capsules, as [I'll] call [them]) - um, those are counted in the little, uh, number, up in the upper right-hand corner, there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you have enough, you [can] hit one of those letters and then k... uh, the -- basically, it'll become kind of like a "...Z..." -- top-down "...Zelda" Action-Adventure game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Once we get past all the loading screens, here.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And here we go! [Now ya] can run around [and] shoot things! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I actually got, like, an Oxygen, uh, refill there; that's [what that] little red beaker was. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] see, my oxygen is constantly counting down. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and here, I've got *missiles*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I [have] a, uh, three-button Life Bar on the upper left side, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, as you go through the game, you'll get powered up and get more. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Hitting the, uh, Select button [will] bring up this screen; it'll tell ya which items you have, which, uh, (I guess we'll call them...) dungeons that you've completed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's A through Z. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, more or less, the object [of this] game is [to] fly around, get [money], get oxygen, uh, then explore the dungeons, and, uh, so on {and} so forth! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [There's actually] even Item Shops in this, where you [can] power-up, uh, your vehicle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([For] example, there's one found in the A dungeon.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game re... -- might remind you of a later game from Compile, called "The Guardian Legend". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I wouldn't say this is [as] *good* as that game, but it's [an] interesting *idea*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Truthfully, the game is sort of long and boring. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And it'll probably] take you [a] while [to] get through it; some [of] these, uh, dungeons [are] actually quite long. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the Shop. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you [can] buy more powerful lasers! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Other dungeons [will] have shops where ya can buy better shields [and] more life - all kinds of stuff. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While this is all very interesting, uh, the game itself isn't actually very good. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Shoot-'em-Up [sections are not a] whole lot of fun; they're, sort of, boring [and] repetitive. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The dungeon sections are very long and tricky, and, of course, you have to find hidden passages, [that] sort of thing - all [while] on a [pretty] strict timer. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, you've gotta give Imagineer [and] Wave Jack credit [for] trying something a little different. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Star Force 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 October 31 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tecmo 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 From the rather notorious Kemco, we have "Super Star Force". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a FamiCom original and an -- the official sequel to "Star Force". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly, Hudson [had already] released a semi-sequel [to] "Star Force", namely "Star Soldier". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of the two, "Star Soldier" is the much better game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One odd little thing I've noticed [about] the FamiCom is the way that a series of very similar games [will] be [released] almost simultaneously. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, "Star Force" was [released only] five days after "Ginga Denshou...", yet these games [are] both Shoot-'em-Ups with R.P.G. features. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, lemme say this game is marginally better [than] the original "Star Force". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The graphics are really not half bad, [and] the asteroid things [that] you fly over are, uh, [pretty] nicely detailed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [However], what [exactly] is [the] story with the starfields? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya notice [that] all [of] the stars are lined up in diagonal lines! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game features [pretty] standard Shoot-'em-Up action, though occasionally your [ship will] fly over little boxes that represent either Shops or Warp Zones. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the Shops, you [can] buy various power-ups from, like, a little Wizard dude. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Warp Zones, however, [will] let you warp either backwards or forwards in time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I just warped to DA 1301, apparently - back when the w... -- universe was covered [in] water. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you travel through time, you'll find the appearance {of} the world changes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [At] one point, you [can even] warp back [into] the present day, where you'll fly over a modern city. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, while [this is an] interesting gimmick, it doesn't really affect the gameplay and, at heart, "Super Star Force" is basically an average Shooter - nothing more. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Trainer: Atheletic World 🇯🇵 // Athletic World 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 12 🇯🇵 // 1987 July [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is Bandai's "Family Trainer: Athletic World". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it's the first game [to] make use [of] their FamiCom accessory, the Family Trainer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the US, this [was released] as the Power Pad. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Apparently, Nintendo musta been quite pleased with Bandai's creation because they purchased the rights [to release] {it} themselves in the US. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] sure you recall this [particular] accessory [if] you had a Nintendo back in the 1980s. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Power Pad is a thin mat [that registers] movement when ya step on it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this case, [as] you run [and] jump [on] the pad, so does your character. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [In the] U.S. version [of] the game, you could enter in your name, age, and sex, as you [can] see here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] several different gameplay variations in "...Athletic World", but they're all [pretty] similar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They [pretty] much all involve running [and] jumping on the mat. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This, for example, has a very simple race with hurdles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {In} the 'Dark Tunnel', you jog [along] some sort of pyramid [or] something like that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Family Trainer [and] the Power Pad must [have] been reasonably successful [because] they [released] (oh, I don't know) maybe about 10 games [or] so, altogether, for it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing [that] *is* interesting [to note] about this game is it was actually developed by Human Entertainment. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Human was a Japanese development company [and] publisher that started up in 1983, began publishing games themselves in 1990, [and] finally [went out] of business in 1999. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They [are] definitely a bit more [reputable than the] likes of Tose, [who developed] most [of] the prior Bandai Games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps Human's most well-known series in [the United] States is the 'Clock Tower' games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As for the Power Pad, [we'll discuss this] more [when we] look [at] some [of] the later 'Family Trainer' games. 🍇🍌

👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Hudson followed up "Adventure Island" with this title "Meikyuu Kumikyoku..." (which literally means 'Maze Suite'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The word 'Suite' [in the] title is appropriate, [since] this game [has sort of] a musical theme. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The English title is "Milon's Secret Castle", (undoubtedly [referred to] by many folks as 'Milton's Secret Castle'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The character's Japanese name seems [to] be Miron or Milon, but [we'll refer to him] as Milon. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The plot involves Milon having [to] collect a series of crystal balls which [are] scattered [throughout] his castle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Apparently, the castle [has] been taken over by some sort of villainous fellow named Maharito. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Milon has [to] work [his] way [up] four floors, each of which have several rooms. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Along the way, [he'll] make occasional side trips, such as going down a well, at one point. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, here we see the first [room of] the castle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Getting through this involves finding the hidden key as well [as] the hidden [exit] door. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Along the way, you'll want to look [and] try [to] find a [lot] of various hidden [items] (for example, the money [that] we just found). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Other things you [can] find include the Hudson bee logo. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Collecting] that [will] give you a, uh, temporary shield. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Another hidden item you'll find is a honeycomb that [will increase] your Life Bar by one point. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, a lot of people find this game [to be] very [difficult] and rather unpleasant. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I think a lot of [it] has [to] do with the fact [that] virtually everything you need [to] get in this game is hidden. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [have to] be constantly looking [for] things with [your little], uh, bubble there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Ah! There's the honeycomb.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Something else [that] makes this game quite difficult is the fact that, unlike a lot [of] these [kinds] of games, when you're hit by [an] enemy, you [don't] get a moment of temporary invulnerability. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you get hit, you [can get hit] again instantly, and often [an] enemy passing through you [will] re... -- register several hits. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes, if ya get stuck in a [little] nook (like this one, right here) an enemy [can] do *quite* a bit of *damage* [to] you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And a lot of the enemies will make a very fast beeline right towards you, or at {the} very least throw some kind of projectile [at] you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I [can] certainly imagine [that] a [lot] of folks tried playing this game, found it rather frustrating, [and] then gave up quite quickly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is too bad because, once ya get the hang of it, it's actually a reasonably fun game, even though there are certainly some things that, uh, make it a bit unpleasant, at times. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes, hitting the flying enemies [can] be [very] difficult. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the sheer number of dangerous enemies [and] the rather maze-like quality of some [of the] levels make, uh, this game a little rough, at times. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, once [ya] get past the First Boss, you do have an unlimited number of continues. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once you've gotten past the first few rooms, you then go back outdoors, and, uh, eventually, you'll run into the First Boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's {in} [that] little window, right there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, quite frankly, this First Boss is awfully difficult for a first boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Compared [to] the early bosses in "Castlevania", this guy is [pretty] tough because he throws, sort of, high [and] low fireballs randomly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [There's really] no way [to, sort] of, guess his pattern, so it's sort of a matter of quick timing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} took me several tries [to] get through this guy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [remember] you [can't continue until] after you [have] beat him, so really, they should [have toned] this guy *down* a bit. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And something [that's *also* quite] sadistic - after [you] defeat him (unlike, say, "Castlevania"), your Life Bar doesn't get refilled. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And if you step outside [at] night, you [can] get instantly killed by one bolt of *lightning*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And that is one of the slightly annoying things about this game; (is that) it *is* kind of difficult [to] refill [your] Life Bar. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a rather creative little level, right here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There's all [these little, sort] of trapdoors [that] you [can] step on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This -- I mean, the game, uh, has very excellent level [design]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There are [just] certain game flaws -- gameplay flaws that make [the] game [not as] enjoyable [as it] should be. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Something [that] is quite cool are the various [little] *Bonus* Rounds you'll find, occasionally. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, there's one hidden around here, somewhere. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As [I] recall, you actually have to [hit it] from underneath; yes, there it is. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once [you] get this Bonus Round, you go around [collecting] the various, uh, notes, flats, and sharps - trying to, uh -- ya get bonus money, depending on how many you collect. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And what's] rather charming is [that] every time ya get [to this] level, another [musician will start] playing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the musical theme [will] actually change slightly every time [you] play it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [So], like [I] was saying, [it] can be rather difficult [to] completely refill [your] Life Bar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [only] time this [sort] of happens for free is when ya collect a honeycomb. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] you will often, uh, be done [with] a boss, um, with, ya know, not very much health [left]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then ya [sort] of have [to] go on to a new level, which [can be] quite difficult, and you often [find] yourself getting killed, um, very quickly after ya defeat a boss. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Usually, what I end up doing is going back [to], like, an earlier room, killing enemies [until] I collect hearts, [and] then refilling my Health Bar that way, but that's a rather, uh, lengthy [and] boring process. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Enemies drop hearts randomly [and] sometimes [that] actually takes quite some time [to] refill [an] entire Health Bar, simply by killing enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's really nothing like the turkey in "Castlevania" or the fairies in, uh, "...Zelda" that will fill up your Health Bar quickly. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I should [also] mention that, just like "...Zelda", this game has shops that are manned by, sort of, helpful little wizard guys who also give you hints. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A [lot of] the items [that] you buy [at] shops [will] make [it] much easier [to get through] the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, there's armor that makes it, uh, easier [to] get through the, uh -- a level [that] has a lot of fire in it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another issue I have [with this] game is the [fact that] the Bosses are all more or less the same. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They *look* different, but they all have [the] exact same jumping pattern [and] the random high [and] low fireballs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, once [you've] gotten to the First Boss, you'll [probably] find the later bosses [to] be much easier [because] ya have more health [and you're] starting [to] understand the pattern. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Thus, the [difficulty of the Bosses is] actually [sort of inverted]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They get harder, uh, at the beginning [and then get] easier [as] you go along. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Milon's Secret Castle" is a fun, well-made game, but there are a few issues [that] make it much less enjoyable than it oughta be. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hudson would actually improve on this formula a little bit later with their sequel for the Super FamiCom called "DoReMi Fantasy...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That game was [only] released [in] Japan but really is very cool. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Still, "Milon's Secret Castle" can be a fun game if ya put [some effort] into it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dead Zone 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 20 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sunsoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 For the last game, this episode, we're going [to] fire up the old FamiCom Disk System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [game] is called "Dead Zone". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [it] has, I'm sure, no [relation to] the Stephen King novel [and] movie. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll notice the music is actually [pretty] nice and really [not] very typical of Sunsoft. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In [fact], "Dead Zone" is nothing [at] all like previous Sunsoft [releases for the] FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most of their other games they're sort] of simple Platformer and Action-type Games, and "Dead Zone" is actually a Text Adventure Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, [this is only] the second Japanese Text Adventure Game, uh, [for] the FamiCom after "Portopia...". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] this game has a Science-Fiction theme, I'm really not exactly sure [what] it's about. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It appears [to] take place in [some sort] of, like, abandoned, uh, space station, [or] moon base, [or] something like that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game, sort of, starts you off puttering around with these old robots. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [have to remove] the [batteries and whatnot out of] them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, ya move on to other areas of the Space Station. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I certainly have not played this game all the way through. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, I -- I assume, at some point, some sort of, uh, plot starts occurring or something [interesting] happens. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As with "Portopia...", all the commands [are] issued using a menu and your D-Pad [to] make a selection. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Portopia...", a [lot of] the commands here [are] actually, um, quite different. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In "Portopia..." you're mostly talking [with other] folks, occasionally picking up a object [or] pressing a button [or] something like [that]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, you interact almost exclusively with physical [objects]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The commands [are] things like, Take, Open, Move, Carry - that [sort] of thing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So far, I've yet [to] see any actual other characters [in] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps there's, uh, someone later on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The cover of the game box shows a female. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] there's, uh, some robots mentioned, um, in the opening credits. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the female is also a robot; {it's} really hard to say. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 At this point, you're just, sort of, wandering around the base, uh, looking [at] various objects. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, because this game is entirely in Japanese, you [probably] won't be able to [make] sense [out] of most of it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Again, I'm assuming that something interesting does happen - there is some [sort] of payoff [for] all this kind of wandering [around] the space station [or] whatever. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You're probably gonna wanna skip this game unless maybe (at some point in the future) someone decides [to] make a translation [out] of it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And unfortunately, very few of these Japanese Text Adventure Games have been translated [into] English. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 11 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, as those of you who [have] been following these episodes know, every week, we count the number of games with ninjas in 'em and the number of Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And so far, [virtually] every episode has [had] a few [of] these, but this episode, we, in fact, have no ninjas whatsoever. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Of] course, [there] were three *Shoot-'em-Ups*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There was "Terra Cresta", "Super Star [Force]", and "Ginga Denshou...". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But the lack of ninjas is [pretty] disturbing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, quite frankly, this is [pretty] much the way it's gonna be, from now on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] seems the ninjas have really, sort of, temporarily run their course on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] actually, we'll be seeing a lot less Shooters as well, in the future. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... Shooters featured [pretty] heavily in 1985/1986, {however} in 1987, perhaps no... [not so] much. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What [we're] really gonna see are a whole lot of Platformers. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, next episode, we will be seeing one of the all-time [greatest] Shooters for the FamiCom, as well as one of the all-time worst games for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, hopefully, we will see you then! 🍇🍌
