👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 Pre-1985 Video Game Industry Recap ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 We're going to 🍋 start this episode 🍊 by going all the way back to 🍋 the beginning of the decade 🍊 and taking a look at the 🍋 state of video games 🍊 prior to the release 🍋 of the N.E.S. in 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For those of you 🍋 who weren't around, 🍊 you might not be aware 🍋 just how popular 🍊 video games were 🍋 in the early '80s; 🍊 it was a genuine 🍋 cultural phenomenon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 With the introduction 🍋 of "Space Invaders" 🍊 and other popular titles, 🍊 you suddenly started seeing video 🍋 games popping up everywhere. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Pizza parlors, movie theaters, 🍋 bowling alleys, and actual video arcades 🍊 were appearing across 🍋 the country at amazing speed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Pac-Man", in particular, 🍋 was everywhere in the early '80s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were outrageous amounts of 🍋 'Pac-Man' merchandise to be found: 🍊 'Pac-Man' clothing, dolls, toys, 🍋 pillows, trading cards, lunchboxes, 🍊 a 'Pac-Man' cereal, a 'Pac-Man' T.V. show, 🍋 books on how to play "Pac-Man". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The video game itself 🍊 supposedly sucked up over a 🍋 billion dollars in U.S. quarters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the world of home 🍋 video game consoles, 🍊 there were three 🍋 major players: 🍊 the Atari 2600, 🍋 the Intellivision, and 🍋 the ColecoVision. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By 1981, sales of home 🍋 consoles and video games 🍊 exceeded a 🍋 billion dollars a year. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In 1982, a song 🍋 about video games 🍊 (Buckner & Garcia's 🍋 "Pac-Man Fever") 🍊 became a Top 10 hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And before too long, 🍊 even established artists 🍋 like George Clinton 🍊 or cranky old guys 🍋 like Lou Reed 🍊 were releasing 🍋 video game-themed records. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, in 1983, the industry 🍋 suddenly took a turn for the worse. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The resulting loss of sales 🍋 is now known as the great 🍋 Video Game Crash. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were a number of 🍋 factors involved in this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One of them was the release 🍋 of several low-quality games 🍊 from Atari, which ended up 🍋 being very high-profile flops. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the market was 🍋 being flooded with 🍊 inexpensive unlicensed games 🍋 from very small companies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of these games 🍋 were not very good, 🍊 but the sudden influx of, uh, 🍋 cheap product on the shelf 🍊 really caused a lot of 🍋 confusion for consumers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As a result, the biggest player 🍋 in the home console field, Atari, 🍊 ended up losing a reported 🍋 five hundred million dollars 🍊 for the year of 1983. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In February of 1984, 🍋 Mattel sold the rights 🍊 to the Intellivision 🍋 to a liquidation company. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later that year, 🍊 the ColecoVision was discontinued 🍋 and the Atari 5200 was discontinued. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The companies that had 🍋 been developing games 🍊 for home consoles 🍋 were dropping like flies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In July, Warner sold 🍋 the rights to the Atari 🍊 for a mere two hundred 🍋 and forty million dollars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At this point, the media 🍊 officially declared the 🍋 video game fad to be over. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, there are a 🍋 couple things to consider. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even though sales 🍋 of home consoles 🍋 had [pretty] much stalled, 🍊 video arcades were still popular 🍋 hangouts for young people. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, these years 🍋 (from '84 - '85 or so) 🍊 are considered to be a sort of 🍋 a golden age in Arcade games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, the 🍋 Video Game Crash 🍊 didn't really have a very 🍋 big effect in other countries. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In Japan, for example, 🍊 video games were mostly played 🍋 on home computers at this point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Japanese M.S.X. computers 🍋 and N.E.C.'s P.C.-88 computers 🍊 still continued to 🍋 sell quite well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So when Nintendo released 🍋 the FamiCom in 1983, 🍊 they had no reason to believe 🍋 that they were entering 🍊 a dead industry in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By the beginning of 1985, 🍊 the FamiCom was a 🍋 resounding success in Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Despite this, they couldn't 🍋 find any U.S. companies 🍊 interested in actually distributing 🍋 it within the United States. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When Nintendo finally did 🍊 release the N.E.S. in the 🍋 United States in late 1985, 🍊 [they pretty] much had the home 🍋 video game market all to themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, it ended up being 🍋 a huge success in this country, 🍊 which proved that Americans did, in fact, 🍋 still have an interest in video games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 3 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Today, we'll be looking at 15 🍋 games released for the FamiCom 🍊 in the first half of 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing we'll notice 🍋 is that Nintendo adds 🍊 three major arcade manufacturers 🍋 to their list of FamiCom developers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, we'll observe an 🍋 increasing number of 🍊 Japan-[only] releases. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, out of the 15 titles 🍋 we're looking at today, 🍊 [only] five were released 🍋 in the United States. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Exerion 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 February 11 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Jaleco | Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So the first title that we're 🍋 looking at here is "Exerion", 🍊 this is Jaleco's first 🍋 game for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, 🍋 this is a Vertical Shooter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is actually the first Vertical 🍋 Shooter released on the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The name 'Jaleco' is short for 🍋 Japanese Leisure Company. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were formed 🍋 in the early '70s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By 1982, they'd released 🍋 their first Arcade game 🍊 with the rather unusual 🍋 name of "Naughty Boy". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Jaleco is not really known for 🍋 having a lot of great Arcade titles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, if you think about it, 🍊 you probably really can't name 🍋 one of their Arcade titles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were successful enough to 🍋 stay in business for years and years. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They're actually still around 🍋 - still making games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this game is based on 🍋 their 1983 Arcade Shooter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We're looking at the 🍋 Arcade version, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's, uh... looks, uh, 🍊 maybe a little bit better 🍋 than the FamiCom version, 🍊 but it's still not 🍋 great, graphically. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Certainly, the, uh, 🍋 the parallax 3D 🍊 (or pseudo-3D) 🍋 backgrounds look better. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing about the Arcade version 🍋 is that it's very difficult to play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your ship has, like, a, uh, 🍋 simulated inertia built into it 🍊 that makes it steer like a fish. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's really hard to 🍋 move your ship around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The FamiCom version 🍋 isn't nearly as bad, 🍊 but this is still not a 🍋 very playable game, 🍊 compared to something 🍋 like "Xevious", 🍊 which was the obvious 🍋 inspiration for this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's rather unenjoyable. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The ship does not control very well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your, uh, firing options, here, 🍊 are -- are really not 🍋 that, uh, pleasant. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's kind of ugly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of the enemies, like -- 🍋 these look sort of like the, uh, 🍊 birds from the 🍋 "Phoenix" Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, I'd say this is probably 🍋 the first really mediocre game, 🍊 released on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's certainly one that's hard to 🍋 play for more than a few minutes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The constantly, uh, 🍋 changing backgrounds 🍊 kind of give you a 🍋 bit of a headache 🍊 and make you 🍋 feel a little seasick 🍊 while you're playing it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So I'm going to have to give 🍋 this game a big thumbs down. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Galaga 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 February 15 🇯🇵 // 1988 09 [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // Bandai 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here we have "Galaga". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is Namco's 1981 🍋 sequel to "Galaxian". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Galaxian" hasn't really 🍋 held up that well over the years, 🍊 at least in my opinion. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Galaga" is a much 🍋 more playable game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What did Namco do 🍋 to improve on this? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, first of all, 🍊 they have better graphics, 🍋 better sound, 'n' better gameplay. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] first thing you 🍋 might notice right away 🍊 is you can fire more 🍋 than one shot in the air. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This little addition makes 🍋 the game a lot more fun to play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sort of one of the frustrating 🍋 things about "Galaxian" 🍊 was simply the fact that, uh, 🍋 you would shoot and sort of 🍊 have to wait 'til your 🍋 laser gets all the way up 🍊 in the air and hit something; 🍊 this way you just sort of 🍋 blast away at things. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In these days of 🍋 modern Shoot-em-Ups, 🍊 we [pretty] much 🍋 take for granted 🍊 that you're able to throw out 🍋 massive amounts of firepower 🍊 at any given time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But that definitely 🍋 wasn't the case, 🍊 back in the days of 🍋 "Space Invaders", and "Galaxian". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably one of the most 🍊 well-remembered 🍋 features of this game 🍊 is the ability to get 🍋 two ships at once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Occasionally, one of the boss aliens 🍋 will use a tractor beam to steal a ship. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can then let -- 🍋 use one of your reserve ships 🍊 to shoot down that alien and 🍋 your stolen ship will come back. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you have two ships in tandem, 🍋 enabling you to double your firepower. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Which, of course, makes the 🍋 game even that more fun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've got your 🍋 second ship in place, 🍊 you become a -- basically 🍋 a virtual killing machine. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess you might say this is 🍋 probably one of the very first, 🍊 uh, sort of, power-ups 🍋 in an Arcade Shooter. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This FamiCom port 🍋 looks very, very good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's virtually identical 🍋 to the Arcade version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What can you expect from a 🍋 game that came out in 1981? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's these little 🍋 bonus rounds here 🍊 where you sort of, uh, 🍋 simply try to rack up points 🍊 by shooting all of the aliens 🍋 that come down at you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Galaga" is one of those games 🍋 that makes you realize 🍊 why Namco was such a 🍋 powerhouse in the early '80s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's one of those games 🍋 that's just super fun to play! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Raid on Bungeling Bay 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 February 22 🇯🇵 // 1987 09 [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // Brøderbund 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The next title we're looking 🍋 at is "Raid on Bungeling Bay". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's go back just a minute and 🍋 take a look at that title screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We see this is another 🍋 Hudson Soft game, 🍊 also a port of a Brøderbund game, 🍋 just like "Lode Runner". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 What's that? 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 That is correct. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the first game 🍋 from Will Wright. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Will Wright: game designer, 🍋 entrepreneur, enfant terrible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So we go into this game with 🍋 perhaps slightly higher expectations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Does it disappoint? 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 Well, no, not entirely. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Raid on Bungeling Bay" 🍋 is a warfare game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You control a helicopter 🍋 whose job is to destroy factories. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your base of operations is an 🍋 aircraft carrier out in the sea. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your object is to fly out to the islands 🍋 and drop bombs on the factories. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Along the way, you'll encounter 🍋 boats with machine guns, 🍊 surface-to-air missiles, 🍋 and enemy jet fighter planes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Out of all the enemies, 🍊 it's the jet fighters that 🍋 cause you the most trouble. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The controls might take 🍋 a little getting used to. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Left or Right on the D-Pad 🍋 will rotate your helicopter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Up will accelerate 🍋 and Down will decelerate. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Throughout the game, 🍊 you might occasionally find 🍋 yourself using the D-Pad, 🍊 uh, to f... -- 🍋 in a more conventional fashion 🍊 and you have to remind yourself 🍋 of how the control scheme works. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game doesn't 🍋 seem that difficult at first, 🍊 but once the jet fighters get alerted 🍋 and start constantly attacking, 🍊 [it] actually gets quite difficult 🍋 and a little frustrating at times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably the best approach to 🍋 this game is to fly in cautiously; 🍊 try to avoid being seen by 🍋 the enemy patrols and radar. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you are seen, 🍋 the jet fighters will scramble 🍊 and suddenly your job [would] 🍋 become much more difficult. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can [only] carry 🍋 nine bombs at a time, 🍊 so you'll find yourself frequently 🍋 returning to the aircraft carrier 🍊 to get more bombs and 🍋 to replenish your health. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game almost has elements 🍋 of letter -- later Stealth Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The easiest way to get through it is 🍋 to avoid being seen by the enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If the alarm is sounded, 🍋 you're in trouble. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Occasionally, the enemies 🍋 will turn the table on you 🍊 and start attacking 🍋 the aircraft carrier. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing you 🍋 might be thinking is, 🍊 'Isn't this game a bit violent 🍋 for the FamiCom?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's one thing to fight 🍊 with animals, gorillas, aliens, 🍋 - that sort of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But by flying a helicopter 🍋 over cities and dropping bombs, 🍊 I mean, you're actually probably 🍋 killing quite a few innocent civilians. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, according to Brøderbund, no, 🍊 that's actually not what ha... 🍋 -- what's happening. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, you're on a s... 🍋 -- different planet 🍊 and you're battling 🍋 an evil alien empire, 🍊 called the Bungeling Empire. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By some coincidence, 🍋 everything on this planet 🍊 just happens to look like 🍋 regular Earth factories 🍊 and buildings and planes 🍋 and so on, so forth. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Brøderbund seemed to 🍋 want to have some sort of 🍊 consistent universe 🍋 across their games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So a number of their games 🍋 deal with this Bungeling Empire. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, "Lode Runner"; 🍊 supposedly the, uh, 🍋 enemies in that game 🍊 are agents of this very 🍋 same Bungeling Empire 🍊 that you're battling in 🍋 "Raid on Bungeling Bay". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So this game is a rather interesting 🍋 little game from its time period. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you get into it, it's 🍋 actually kind of enjoyable to play. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this game apparently 🍋 originally came with a level editor. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was actually this level editor 🍊 that Will Wright was fooling 🍋 around with and realized, 🍊🍓 "Hmm! You know, 🍋 building stuff is a lot of fun; 🍊 maybe I could do an entire game, 🍋 based around building cities.🍇". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if nothing else, fool 🍋 around with the level editor; 🍊 maybe you, yourself, will also 🍋 get a gazillion-dollar idea. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Formation Z 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 April 04 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hect | Jaleco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The next game we're looking at, here, 🍋 is "Formation Z" - also from Jaleco. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like "Exerion", 🍋 this game is a Shooter 🍊 ([only] this one is a 🍋 Horizontal Shooter). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, much like that other game, 🍋 this game just isn't very good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, playing "Formation Z" 🍋 is a grim, joyless experience. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You probably will not have 🍋 a very good time playing it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game isn't all bad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It does have a few original concepts 🍋 (well, not completely original, 🍊 but perhaps the first time these 🍋 ideas had been used in a video game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character can change 🍋 from a little robot 🍊 (running along the ground 🍋 and jumping) to a jet fighter. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By pressing Up on the D-Pad 🍋 while you're jumping, 🍊 he will transform 🍋 into a jet fighter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this, of course, was not 🍋 something this game invented; 🍊 it had been seen in 🍋 various Japanese cartoons 🍊 like 'Robotech' and, 🍋 of course, 'Transformers'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A couple more notable Shooters would 🍋 use this same concept in later years. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I guess the one 🍋 graphically interesting feature 🍊 about this game is the fact that 🍋 the screen scrolls up and down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That was sort of 🍋 unusual in its time, 🍊 but it's still a rather 🍋 bland and dull-looking game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was actually a port of [a] slightly 🍋 earlier Arcade game from Jaleco, 🍊 and the graphics look about 🍋 the same on both versions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So ultimately, this game is 🍋 not very pleasant to look at. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's repetitive and boring; 🍋 and when you're in 🍊 the shape of the robot 🍋 running along the ground, 🍊 it's kind of difficult to 🍋 actually shoot the guys. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 To give you an idea of, uh, 🍋 how much this game is lacking, 🍊 this came out in February 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Gradius" would be in arcades 🍋 just about a month later. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So this game was very 🍋 much behind the curve 🍊 when it came to other Shooters. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Soccer 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 April 09 🇯🇵 // 1987 03 [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 From April 1985, we have 🍋 "Soccer", developed by Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, notice that you get to, 🍋 uh, choose your team here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You're just, sort of, generic teams 🍋 representing different countries. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Interestingly, they've given the 🍋 players from the different nations 🍊 slightly different skin tones. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You also choose the skill level 🍋 and the length of the halftime. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've chosen 15 minutes 🍋 but if you look at the timer, 🍊 you'll see time is actually going 🍋 by much faster than real time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, this game is 🍋 certainly not bad; 🍊 it's certainly a hell of a lot 🍋 better than "Formation Z". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One technical aspect 🍋 about these sorts of games 🍊 is that you're not controlling 🍋 an individual player; 🍊 you're controlling 🍋 an entire team. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of these games have 🍋 some sort of mechanism 🍊 where you can switch 🍋 between, uh, different players. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is no different. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The player you actually 🍋 have control over 🍊 is the one with the little 🍋 arrow pointing to him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can use your B button to 🍋 move around from player to player. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And in a case like this, 🍋 you can use your D-Pad 🍊 to control which player you 🍋 want to throw the ball to. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Something that is a little 🍋 confusing on this game 🍊 (and does hamper gameplay) 🍊 is the fact that the player 🍋 that you have selected 🍊 will change automatically 🍊 depending on the 🍋 proximity to the ball. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This can make gameplay 🍋 difficult at times, 🍊 especially when the ball is 🍊 being [kicked] around 🍋 back and forth a lot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You will find yourself 🍋 controlling one team member, 🍊 when suddenly the control 🍋 automatically switches 🍋 to another member 🍊 because the ball has 🍋 gotten closer to him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Other than that, the game 🍋 is, uh, is [pretty] decent. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a very 🍋 basic Soccer Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You use, uh, one button to kick, 🍋 one button to change players. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like real Soccer Games, 🍊 it seems that often you 🍋 spend a lot of time, uh, 🍊 fighting back and forth 🍋 for control of the ball, 🍊 rather than actually scoring. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are, I suppose, a 🍋 couple interesting things here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, there is a very cute 🍋 little halftime show that occurs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Likewise, when the game is over, 🍋 the winners do a little dance. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Other than that, 🍋 I would say that 🍊 "Soccer" is an average 🍋 (not outstanding) Sports Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This would be the last Sports Game 🍋 Nintendo would make for a little while. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They wouldn't make 🍋 another one ("Volleyball") 🍊 until about a year 🍋 and a half from now. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Space Invaders 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 April 17 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito | Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 April 1985 sees another 🍋 third-party developer 🍊 making games for the Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This developer is the 🍋 arcade giant, Taito. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And here we have 🍋 their "Space Invaders". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This starts off 🍋 [pretty] promisingly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Taito, uh, was 🍋 one of the major players 🍊 in the arcade scene 🍋 in the early '80s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were a company 🍋 that'd been around 🍊 for quite some time 🍋 - since the 1950s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the '70s, they started 🍊 going into amusement 🍋 games and Arcade games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And in 1978 they released 🍋 one of the most popular 🍊 and influential video games 🍋 of all time: "Space Invaders". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In a lot of ways, 🍋 "Space Invaders" 🍊 was the game that helped 🍋 popularize video games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you would think 🍋 it would not be difficult 🍊 for Taito to port one of their own 🍋 Arcade games to the FamiCom, 🍊 especially one that 🍋 came out in 1978. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It sort of recreates the original 🍋 Arcade intro screen, there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But once you actually 🍋 start playing the game, 🍊 you'll realize that 🍋 something is seriously wrong. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The original Arcade game 🍋 controls very, very smoothly 🍊 and is a joy to play 🍋 (even in this day and age). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The FamiCom version 🍋 by -- by contrast, 🍊 seems sort of, uh, 🍋 stiff and sluggish. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For one thing, it seems that 🍋 the actual space invaders 🍊 are much harder to 🍋 hit with your cannon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When you compare 🍋 the two versions, 🍊 the FamiCom seems to have 🍋 placed the actual enemies 🍊 much further apart than 🍋 the original Arcade version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Arcade "Space Invaders" 🍊 has a screen that's much 🍋 higher than it is wide 🍊 and it seems when 🍋 converting to the 🍊 wider format used 🍋 by the FamiCom, 🍊 something was really lost 🍋 in the translation here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it seems what should have 🍋 been a [pretty] easy conversion 🍊 eventually comes [across] 🍋 as quite a bit of a letdown. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Championship Lode Runner 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 April 17 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Brøderbund | Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Released the same day 🍋 as "Space Invaders" is 🍋 "Championship Lode Runner". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first "Lode Runner" was 🍋 a huge hit on the FamiCom, 🍊 so naturally Hudson Soft 🍋 ported the sequel. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This looks and plays 🍊 [pretty] much exactly like 🍋 the first "Lode Runner" 🍊 [only] it's much, much, 🍋 much more difficult. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, at first glance, uh, this 🍋 game looks virtually impossible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Only] the expert "Lode Runner" 🍋 player can really figure this out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Whereas the first, "Lode Runner" 🍋 seemed to be, sort of, 🍊 running around, uh, 🍋 avoiding the enemies, 🍊 this game is a lot of time, 🍋 uh, working on puzzles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, that little 🍋 pile of gold dust right there 🍊 appears impossible to get 🍋 without trapping yourself 🍊 on first glance 🍊 but through a clever combination 🍋 of erasing blocks, you can get to it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Championship Lode Runner" is 🍋 loaded with traps 'n' dead ends. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It is ridiculously easy to 🍋 find yourself trapped 🍊 with no way to get out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And a lot of the solutions 🍋 are not really obvious. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You can select different 🍋 stages, up to Stage 5, 🍊 when you first start 🍋 playing the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later stages 🍋 require a password. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's an example of the typical 🍋 puzzle-like levels in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can't seem to get to any 🍋 of those piles of gold dust 🍊 without trapping yourself 🍊 and when you try to 🍋 walk over to the right, 🍊 you trap yourself immediately 🍋 and then the enemies 🍊 come and get you 🍋 and there's no way out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On the other hand, 🍊 if you simply walk over 🍋 and peer onto the ledge, 🍊 the enemies won't 🍋 come and try to get you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Championship Lode Runner" 🍋 does have an option where, 🍊 by hitting the Start button, 🍋 you can use the D-Pad 🍊 to move the camera 🍋 around the room, 🍊 as we did just a moment ago. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So what's the solution to this? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, you need to lure the enemies 🍋 down to you by going down one level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as you can see, 🍋 they're advancing towards the pit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once they've all fallen into the pit, 🍋 you can safely cross over them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So if you've completely mastered 🍋 the first "Lode Runner", [and] 🍊 are looking for a bigger challenge, 🍋 by all means, give it a shot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Everyone else should 🍋 probably steer clear 🍊 as this game will frustrate 🍋 and confuse you to no end. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Antarctic Adventure 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 April 22 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our next game here is 🍋 "Antarctic Adventure" by Konami. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is, in fact, the first 🍋 Konami game for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Konami originally started 🍋 as a jukebox company 🍊 back in the late '60s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The name 'Konami' 🍋 was actually taken 🍊 from letters in the names 🍋 of the three founders. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By around the late '70s, they 🍋 had started making video games, 🍊 and in the early '80s had a string 🍋 of very popular Arcade titles, 🍊 such as "Frogger", "Tutankham", 🍋 "Super Cobra", "Track and Field", 🍊 and many more. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, once Konami had signed on 🍋 to make games for the FamiCom, 🍊 that meant that Nintendo 🍋 had three out of the four 🍊 largest Japanese game 🍋 developers working with them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 That, of course, was 🍋 Konami, Taito, and Namco. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The fourth Japanese arcade 🍋 giant was, of course, Sega. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, at this stage, 🍋 Sega was viewing Nintendo 🍊 more as competition rather 🍋 than a potential partner. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sega will make a dramatic entrance 🍋 into our story later this year. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, about this game 🍋 - what's it like? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I believe that 🍋 this is a port of a game 🍊 Konami originally developed 🍋 for the M.S.X. in 1983. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's essentially a Racing Game, [only] 🍋 you have a penguin instead of a car. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Use your D-Pad - 🍊 Up and Down to 🍋 control the speed, 🍊 Left and Right to 🍋 control the movement. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your object is to race 🍋 down a little track 🍊 and get to the research 🍋 laboratory at the end. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In between levels, a map 🍋 will plot your progress 🍋 around the continent. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've gotten 🍋 all the way around, 🍋 the game starts again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is supposedly 🍋 well-remembered in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was never 🍋 released in the U.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's not bad 🍊 - almost like a cross 🍊 between a Racing Game 🍋 and a Platformer 🍊 because you have to jump 🍋 over various obstacles, 🍊 such as holes, pits... 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The, uh, little ice holes often 🍋 have seals that pop out of them 🍊 and you will hit the 🍋 seal while jumping. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As a result, it often 🍋 makes more sense 🍊 to try to avoid holes 🍋 rather than jump over them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess we'll call this 🍊 a reasonably fun but not 🍋 terribly addictive game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Yie Ar Kung-Fu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 April 22 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The same day as 🍋 "Antarctic Adventure", 🍊 Konami released 🍋 "Yie Ar Kung-Fu", 🍊 a port of their relatively 🍋 recent Arcade game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the original Arcade 🍋 "Yie Ar Kung-Fu" 🍊 was a genuinely pioneering title. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, it sort of set the template 🍋 for all fighting games to follow. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this game, you fought 🍋 a variety of opponents, 🍊 usually armed with different 🍋 weapons and special skills. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You had a number of different 🍋 attacks you can employ. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game was quite simple, 🍊 compared to the later fighting 🍋 games such as "Street Fighter", 🍊 but at the time this was 🍋 completely innovative. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the FamiCom 🍋 "Yie Ar Kung-Fu" 🍊 doesn't quite live up 🍋 to the same standards. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, it's almost a 🍋 completely different game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this game was also 🍋 released on the M.S.X. 🍊 at around the same time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I can't help but wonder if 🍊 maybe the Arcade version 🍋 and the home console version 🍊 were developed simultaneously. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, you'll notice this game has 🍋 an unusually horrifying color scheme: 🍊 green, red, and purple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They've also reduced the number of 🍋 opponents that you face from 11 to 5. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And your move set is 🍋 also very much reduced. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [only] have, uh, 🍋 basic kicks and punches. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is also 🍋 somewhat harder to control. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, my personal preferences 🍋 for playing "Yie Ar Kung-Fu" 🍊 in the Arcade version involve 🍋 a lot of jumping around. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game makes it quite 🍋 a bit more difficult to jump. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, the hit detection 🍋 on this is a little strange. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of times you'll be standing 🍋 right next [to] someone, 🍊 hit them, and 🍋 it doesn't register. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game sort of underscores 🍋 a problem for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As arcade systems became 🍋 more and more advanced, 🍊 the FamiCom stayed the same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Yie Ar Kung-Fu" is really, I think, 🍋 the first port of an Arcade game 🍊 that suffers substantially 🍋 in comparison to the Arcade original. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The FamiCom simply isn't capable 🍋 of recreating this Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This would become 🍋 even more true in time 🍊 as Arcade games 🍋 got graphically 🍊 more and more complex 🍋 and bigger and bigger. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The thing is, 🍋 "Yie Ar Kung-Fu" 🍋 for the FamiCom 🍊 is actually a lot better than 🍋 something like "Urban Champion". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It [only] suffers in 🍋 comparison to the original. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ninja-kun Ma-jō no Bōken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 May 10 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by UPL | Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And from May of 1985, we 🍋 have "Ninja-kun..." by Jaleco. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a port of a 1984 Arcade 🍋 game that was originally by UPL. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 U.P.L.'s a company you 🍋 might not be familiar with. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They made several 🍋 Arcade games 🍊 but were not 🍋 particularly well known. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The graphics on 🍋 the Arcade version 🍊 look more or less 🍋 identical to this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The original Arcade 🍋 version wasn't [a] 🍊 particularly graphically 🍋 sophisticated-looking game, 🍊 so the FamiCom is able to 🍋 capture it [pretty] accurately. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, 'Ninja-kun...' is, 🍋 uh, a series of games 🍊 (this being the very first one). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Jaleco would continue to 🍋 release them from time to time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The full title of this game is 🍋 "Ninja-kun Ma-jou no Bouken", 🍊 which means something 🍋 along the lines of 🍊 'Adventure at Demon Castle'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You might wonder, 🍊 'Well, this doesn't 🍋 appear to be a castle; 🍊 it looks like you're 🍋 on a series of cliffs.'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later you do, uh, run around, up 🍋 with, like, a Japanese-style castle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And later, there are also things 🍋 that look more like demons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These guys here 🍋 look more like ninjas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you play this small ninja. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the object of the game 🍊 is simply to kill every 🍋 enemy on the level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 OK, we're about to enter the castle 🍋 level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just a warning: 🍊 Demon Castle does not 🍋 actually look anywhere 🍋 near as cool as it sounds. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you're armed 🍋 with throwing stars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A single star will 🍋 take out any enemy, 🍊 however, you can also, 🍋 uh, knock them out 🍊 simply by running into them, 🍋 uh, like from -- from behind 🍊 or even jumping on them 🍋 from the top, like you... 🍋 like you see right there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably the easiest way 🍋 to take care of enemies 🍊 is to, uh, hit them below and 🍋 then use your stars on them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing about this game is 🍋 that the, uh, means of jumping 🍊 seems a bit more complicated 🍋 than it should be. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You actually have to 🍋 be mooing -- moving 🍊 to the left or the right, in 🍋 order to jump up a level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're not touching the 🍋 D-Pad to the left or the right 🍊 and you get the jump button, 🍋 you'll actually jump down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 To me, it seems it would 🍋 make more sense 🍊 to be able to 🍋 jump up and down, 🍊 by hitting Up or Down 🍋 on the D-Pad, 🍊 but that's not the way 🍋 that Jaleco chose to do it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, you're now 🍋 fighting actual demons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The enemies tend to get 🍋 more difficult in later levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As far as I know, 🍋 "Ninja-kun..." has no real ending; 🍊 the three levels just 🍋 keep repeating infinitely. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So this is certainly 🍋 not a bad game; 🍊 it's kind of fun to play 🍋 for a little while. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You probably won't gain immense 🍋 satisfaction from playing it, 🍊 but it certainly is a 🍋 nice little time-killer 🍊 - certainly much better 🍋 than "Formation Z". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Chack'n Pop 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 May 24 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito | Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 OK, next up, we have 🍋 "Chack'n Pop" from Taito. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is taken from their 🍋 1983 Arcade game, 🍊 which you probably 🍋 won't remember; 🍊 it wasn't exactly a huge hit, 🍋 as far as I know. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, if you're 🍋 looking at this game 🍊 and it seems kind of familiar, 🍊 that's because it does, in fact, 🍋 resemble "Bubble Bobble" a little bit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Taito, now, technically 🍋 considers this game to be 🍊 sort of the predecessor 🍋 to "Bubble Bobble". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some of the character sprites 🍋 were used in "Bubble Bobble". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, one thing about 🍋 "Bubble Bobble" is 🍊 it is a whole helluva lot 🍋 more fun than this game 🍊 (not that this game is really bad; 🍋 it's just nothing spectacular). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You play the little 🍋 yellow guy with the wings; 🍊 your name is Chack'n. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can, uh, crawl around 🍋 the, uh, ceilings and floors 🍊 and you can also drop bombs 🍋 (those little red things are bombs). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 When they go off, 🍋 they will destroy any, uh, 🍊 monsters or eggs 🍋 in the, uh, nearby vicinity. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your goal is to find the 🍋 hearts that have been captured 🍊 and use a bomb to 🍋 free them from the cage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then get up to the top 🍋 and escape the level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Along the way, you may find 🍋 it very helpful to destroy eggs 🍊 so that, uh, when the 🍋 eggs actually hatch, 🍊 you won't be crawl... -- 🍊 the area won't be crawling 🍋 with monsters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In that way, it also, sort of, 🍋 resembles "Bomberman" a little bit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The controls of this game 🍋 are a little strange; 🍊 eh... I sometimes find myself 🍊 getting a little bit frustrated, 🍋 uh, with the controls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 There are a couple levels 🍋 where it's rather difficult to, 🍊 sort of, get where 🍋 you need to be. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] think there's 🍋 around 10, 12 levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've completed those, 🍋 they simply start repeating. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently, the, 🍋 uh, main goal here 🍊 is to find your girlfriend. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've completed 🍋 all 10 or 12 levels, 🍊 she will appear and then 🍋 it'll start over again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You also have a time limit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If that little guy 🍋 pushing the green egg 🍊 (or whatever that is) 🍊 gets all the way to the end, 🍋 you will lose a life. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 See, right there? 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 I'm some... -- 🍊 I'm having sort of difficulty 🍋 getting on a little ledge. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned, the controls 🍋 can sometimes be a bit frustrating. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So while this is by no 🍋 means a horrible game 🍋 (it's actually kind of fun) 🍊 uh, it's more of a dry run 🍋 for "Bubble Bobble" 🍋 than anything else. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dig Dug 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 June 04 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Namco continues their 🍋 series of classic Arcade titles 🍊 for the FamiCom 🍋 with "Dig Dug". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I assume you all will be 🍋 familiar with this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It was quite the, uh, popular title 🍋 in the arcades, back in the '80s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character, 🍋 Dig Dug, goes around 🍊 and uses his little pump 🍋 to blow up monsters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And that's really 🍋 all there is to it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is one of those games where 🍋 the simplicity of the gameplay 🍊 really helps make it 🍋 appealing and addictive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have two kind of monsters: 🍋 the little fellows with the goggles 🍊 and the little dragons 🍋 that breathe fire. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They can actually 🍋 travel through the dirt. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Occasionally they'll turn into little 🍋 transparent eyes and follow you around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like most games this era, 🍋 it starts out simply enough. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each level the difficulty increases 🍋 until finally you, uh, run out of lives. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One way of, uh, getting more points 🍋 is to crush them with rocks 🍊 rather than blow them up 🍋 with your pump. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also if you drop two rocks per level, 🍊 you'll get little bonus vegetables and 🍋 fruit and whatnot that'll appear there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And once again, 🍋 Namco wisely decided 🍊 to keep the original 🍋 aspect ratio of the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Taito certainly could have 🍋 learned something from this 🍊 when they made 🍋 "Space Invaders". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Not much to say about this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This looks, uh, [pretty] much 🍋 just like the Arcade version 🍊 and is t... -- a very 🍋 fun little classic. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Flappy 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 April 14 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by dB-Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by dB-Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next up, we have 🍋 "Flappy" by dB-Soft. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game starts out with a rather 🍋 helpful and long demonstration screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sort of gives you an idea how 🍋 to actually play this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Flappy" is what we're going 🍋 to call a "Sokoban"-type game 🍊 ("Sokoban" being an extremely 🍋 popular Japanese computer game 🍊 that is not very 🍋 well known in the West). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The name 'Sokoban' means 🍋 something along the lines of 🍊 'shopkeeper' or 'warehouse keeper' 🍋 in Japanese. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These games are basically where 🍋 you push around objects in a maze. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There is usually 🍋 certain rules, such as: 🍊 you can [only] push the objects, 🍋 not pull them, 🍊 and you can't push 🍋 more than one at a time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like "Lode Runner", 🍋 'Sokoban' games require 🍊 an awful lot of 🍋 planning and strategy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you don't plan carefully, 🍋 you can easily make a fatal error 🍊 that will prevent you 🍋 from finishing the level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, reportedly, this game, 🍋 "Flappy" is quite popular in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, it was never 🍋 released in the United States 🍊 and is not very 🍋 well known over here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You m... -- also might not 🍋 be familiar with the name 🍋 of the developer, dB-Soft. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These guys were 🍋 formed around 1980, 🍊 and they're primarily a 🍋 computer software developer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They did release a 🍋 few video games, 🍊 but really nothing that's 🍋 particularly noteworthy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In Japan, they're 🍋 actually [pretty] notorious 🍊 for releasing a 🍋 game called "177". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "177" was apparently some 🍋 sort of rape-simulation game 🍊 that actually got 🍋 pulled off store shelves 🍊 by order of the 🍋 Japanese government. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, just like Hudson, dB-Soft 🍋 didn't really develop Arcade games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They're more of a developer 🍋 for Japanese computers. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Flappy" is a port of a game that 🍋 they released for the Japanese 🍋 computers originally in 1983. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So at any rate, about "Flappy". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this game, you control 🍋 the little yellow dog-like creature. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the object of the game 🍊 is to get the blue boulder 🍋 on top of the blue platform. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have to clear the 🍋 other boulders out of the way 🍊 in order to do this, usually. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you can crush the boulders 🍋 by, uh, stepping on them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can roll them 🍋 one at a time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you can [only] push them; 🍋 you can't pull them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are also enemies 🍋 to contend with. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, you can find little 🍋 mushroom-type things 🍊 that'll allow you to 🍋 shoot a little arrow at them 🍊 and temporarily paralyze them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They can also be 🍋 squashed with a rock. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned earlier, 🍊 this game is about 95% 🍋 strategy and planning. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's not an easy game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of levels are actually 🍋 quite difficult to figure out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you will have to 🍊 put some serious thought 🍋 into what you're going to do 🍊 before you start 🍋 moving boulders around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've gotten the blue boulder 🍋 onto the blue platform, 🍊 you then move on [to] the next level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Altogether, there's 200 levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Sokoban"-type games 🍊 and other strategy games 🍋 that are similar 🍊 are actually quite 🍋 popular in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So we will see several more 🍋 of these sorts of games 🍊 on the FamiCom in the future. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Japanese seem to have 🍊 a virtually insatiable appetite 🍋 for this sort of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're a fan of "Lode Runner" 🍋 and such puzzle-maze-type games, 🍊 you might wanna check this one out. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Wrecking Crew 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 June 18 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here we have a rather curious 🍋 little title called "Wrecking Crew". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game has the distinction of 🍋 being the sequel to "Mario Bros.", 🍊 as well as one of the 🍋 least-known of the 'Mario' titles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 When discussing "Donkey Kong 3", 🍊 I mentioned that Nintendo 🍋 has the habit of making sequels 🍊 that are often radically 🍋 different than the original. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Wrecking Crew" certainly 🍋 falls into this category, 🍊 as it's really nothing at all 🍋 like the original "Mario Bros.". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the U.S., this game was 🍋 a launch title for the NES. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it actually came out the 🍋 same day as "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For that reason, maybe, 🍊 it sort of fell into the shadow 🍋 of its more famous cousin. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object of this game is to 🍋 (using your sledgehammer) 🍊 destroy all the various destructible 🍋 components of each screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There're various stone walls, ladders, 🍊 that sort of thing 🍋 that need to be destroyed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've destroyed 🍋 everything on the screen, 🍊 you move on to the next level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This goes on through 🍋 a hundred levels, 🍊 after which the whole thing 🍋 starts again, [only] more difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While doing this, 🍋 make sure you dodge 🍊 the various unusual-looking 🍋 monsters roaming around. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there is one interesting 🍋 feature of this game, 🍊 which is that there's actually 🍋 a foreground and a background. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When the monsters 🍋 enter the various doors, 🍊 they actually switch from the 🍋 foreground to the background. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can actually see 🍋 their shadow roaming around, 🍊 but they can't actually hurt you 🍊 until they enter back 🍋 into the foreground. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As is standard for the 'Mario' 🍋 games, there is a bonus level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is to 🍋 hit the little lockers 🍊 until you find the coin 🍋 before the other guy does. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While "Wrecking Crew" 🍊 can certainly be a fun and 🍋 challenging game in places, 🍊 unfortunately it doesn't really 🍊 seem to fit into the rest 🍋 of [the] 'Mario' universe. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And since it came out [only] a few months 🍋 before "Super Mario Bros." and 🍊 (unlike the original "Mario Bros.") 🍋 wasn't an Arcade hit, 🍊 it has sort of fallen into obscurity, 🍋 perhaps undeservedly. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Spartan X 🇯🇵 // Kung Fu 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 June 21 🇯🇵 // 1987 April 15 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our last game, this episode, 🍋 is "Spartan X", 🍊 known as "Kung Fu" 🍋 in the United States. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a port of IREM's 🍋 1984 Arcade game, 🍊 which was known as 🍋 "Kung Fu Master" in the U.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Note the "Paragon Films Ltd." 🍋 copyright notice on the Arcade version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing that's interesting 🍋 about this is it appears [to] 🍊 be based on the Jackie Chan, 🍋 Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao 🍊 film called "Wheels on Meals". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In Japan, this was released 🍋 in theaters as "Spartan X". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If we examine the 🍋 Arcade game's title screen, 🍊 we see it uses the 🍋 exact same logo as the film. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, here the 🍋 similarities end. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Wheels on Meals" 🍋 takes place in Barcelona 🍊 and features a European-style castle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The video game features 🍋 a Chinese environment. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 More than anything else, 🍋 this game resembles 🍊 the pagoda scene from 🍋 Bruce Lee's "Game of Death". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In that film, Bruce Lee fights 🍋 his way to the top of a pagoda, 🍊 one story at a time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each story has a different 🍋 martial arts master. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's basically 🍋 the plot of this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, what has [occurred] here is 🍋 that you play someone named Thomas 🍊 and your girlfriend, Sylvia, 🍋 has been kidnapped 🍊 by the mysterious 'Mr. X'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 She's being held at 🍋 the top of the tower 🍊 and your job is to fight 🍋 your way up to the top. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the names 🍋 'Thomas' and 'Sylvia' 🍊 are from the movie 🍋 "Wheels on Meals". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, there is no 🍋 'Mr. X' in that film. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I assume what actually 🍋 happened here is that 🍊 IREM was already 🍋 working on the game 🍊 when the offer came in 🍋 to tie it in to "Spartan X". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They made a few superficial changes 🍋 (like the character's name) 🍊 and then released 🍋 the game as-is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Doesn't really seem 🍋 likely, however, 🍊 this game was actually 🍋 inspired by the movie. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, when this game came out 🍋 in arcades (back, uh, in 1984) 🍊 it seemed quite revolutionary. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It actually seemed 🍋 a lot different than 🍊 other games that were 🍋 available at that time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, it seemed to have 🍋 some sort of overall plot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game presented you 🍋 with a clearly defined goal: 🍋 rescuing Sylvia. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But unlike single-screen 🍋 games like "Donkey Kong", 🍊 you didn't really know 🍋 what was coming up ahead. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You had a general idea that 🍋 you had to get to the top of 🍊 the five stories of the pagoda, 🍋 but you really did not know 🍊 what would be on those upper 🍋 stories until you got to them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This helped create sort of 🍋 a dramatic tension to the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You knew you had 🍋 an ultimate goal, 🍊 but you had no idea 🍋 what was in store for you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When you first came across 🍋 the various sub-bosses 🍊 at the end of each, uh, floor, 🍋 they were quite a surprise. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Spartan X" is, of course, 🍊 considered to be perhaps the first 🍋 side-scrolling Beat-em-Up game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But in a lot of ways, 🍊 it actually looks forward 🍋 to "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a side-scrolling game with 🍋 a number of clearly defined levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At the end of each level, 🍋 there's sort of a sub-boss 🍊 that you must defeat before 🍋 moving on to the next level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you reach the final level, 🍋 you battle the main boss, 🍊 rescue the girl, 🍋 and then it begins again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We're seeing Mr. X, right here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, he's not 🍋 a very imposing character 🍊 - sort of a regular-looking guy 🍋 with a goofy redneck haircut. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game has a couple 🍋 little graphical indicators 🍊 to sort of let you know 🍋 what your progress is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Near the player life bar, 🍋 you see a number of, uh, boxes 🍊 which tell you which 🍋 floor you're currently on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, a little dragon head 🍋 lets you know 🍊 how many times you've actually 🍋 completed the entire game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The FamiCom version remains 🍋 [pretty] true to the Arcade original. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {The} graphics aren't quite as good, 🍋 but it's close enough 🍊 to certainly be a 🍋 lot of fun to play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is, of course, 🍋 very simple as compared 🍋 to later Beat-em-Ups 🍊 and it is sort of repetitive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, uh, at the time it came 🍋 out originally in arcades, 🍊 it was an immensely 🍋 impressive game. 🍇🍌
