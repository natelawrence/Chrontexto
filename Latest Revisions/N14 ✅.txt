👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 14 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Thanks for tuning into 🍋 "Chrontendo Episode 14" 🍊 and this time we have not one, 🍋 but two big new games from Nintendo! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And we'll finally be done with 1986 🍋 and moving on to 1987! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's start by taking a look at 🍊 the last few games released 🍋 at the end of December 1986. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hikari Shinwa: Palutena no Kagami 🇯🇵 // Kid Icarus 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 19 🇯🇵 // 1987 July [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "...Episode 14"'s [first] game 🍋 is a real doozy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Another F.D.S. release, 🍊 it's "Hikari Shinwa" 🍋 (or 'Myth of Light'), 🍊 released in 1987 in 🍋 the United States as "Kid Icarus...". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 F.D.S. users could obviously 🍋 save their games, 🍊 though in [the] U.S. version 🍋 we had to make do with passwords. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was necessary to change some of 🍋 the sound effects in the U.S. version 🍊 (probably most notably the noise 🍋 that Pit makes when he gets hit). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the U.S. version he makes 🍋 a horrifying animal-like squeal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The ending was changed slightly, 🍊 but, other than that, the two games 🍋 are virtually identical. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here we have the title screen 🍊 that's more familiar 🍋 to most U.S. viewers: 🍊 "Kid Icarus: Angel Land Story". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For those who don't recall 🍋 their Greek mythology, 🍊 Icarus was the son of Daedalus 🍊 and he flew too close to the sun 🍋 and his wings melted. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Kid Icarus..." borrows some characters 🍋 and imagery from Greek mythology 🍊 but doesn't really have anything to 🍋 do with the actual story of Icarus. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Kid Icarus..." looks very similar 🍋 to "Metroid", in a lot of ways, 🍊 and it actually borrows a lot 🍋 of that earlier game's code. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I suppose, in current terminology, 🍊 we would say that it uses 🍋 "Metroid"'s game engine. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, "Kid Icarus..." differs 🍋 from "Metroid" in many ways. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, the actual difficulty 🍋 has been cranked up considerably. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is, in many ways, much harder 🍋 than any of Nintendo's previous games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Notice, over here, the enemies, 🍋 sort of, fall right out of the sky, 🍊 almost directly onto you and, uh, 🍋 [pretty] much come at you non-stop. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, for example, is this, 🍋 uh, Grim Reaper character. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He takes a lot of hits to kill 🍊 and if he happens to be facing 🍋 your direction and sees you, 🍊 he will send a flock of 🍋 mini-reapers to attack you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And (while all this is going on) 🍋 uh, waves of regular enemies 🍊 are coming in to attack you 🍋 at the same time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is actually [only] 🍋 about one minute into the game! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Notice the way that enemies 🍋 sort of fly around you 🍊 and then suddenly dive-bomb 🍋 you at strange angles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, your character 🍋 starts out with almost no health 🍊 and a weapon that can [only] shoot 🍊 a few feet in front of 🍋 him across the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure that the sheer 🍋 difficulty of these early levels 🍊 have undoubtedly 🍋 dissuaded many gamers 🍊 from getting very far 🍋 into the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, just like "...Zelda", you 🍋 collect money from fallen enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They actually look like hearts 🍊 and these can be 🍋 spent on helpful items 🍊 in these very 🍋 "...Zelda"-like shops. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of the items 🍋 have to do with healing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, the barrel enables you 🍋 to carry more healing potions. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Each of "Kid Icarus..."' world[s] 🍋 has four levels, 🍊 followed by a difficult 🍋 and maze-like fortress. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Occasionally, you will encounter 🍋 these, uh, sacred chambers, 🍊 in which Zeus will bestow, uh, 🍋 weapons, uh, power-ups upon you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, for example, 🍋 is one right here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Collecting the arrow will 🍋 increase your firepower, 🍊 uh, from O... 🍋 Level 1 to Level 2. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As we can see, 🍋 they're under Strength. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You will occasionally get health bar 🍋 increases, at the end of the level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This actually has to do 🍊 with how many points you've 🍋 accumulated, during the level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you reach a certain point, 🍋 uh, number of points, 🍊 you'll, uh, get, uh, 🍋 another health bar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, the points are counted off. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These are almost (in some sense, 🍋 I suppose) like Experience Points, 🍊 though I didn't quite 🍋 make it to the next level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, 🍊 Zeus will occasionally send you 🍋 to these testing chambers, uh, 🍊 where you have to fight off 🍋 a large number of enemies, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you survive this, 🍋 you can get some special weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, I'm going to choose 🍋 that little magic wand-like thing, 🍊 which will, sort of, send these little, 🍋 kind of, uh, "Gradius"-like things 🍊 revolving around your ship that'll 🍋 kill, om, enemies [before] they touch you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually very handy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, each world, as I mentioned, 🍋 has, uh, four levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think we're getting near the top. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, these, uh, 🍋 tricky Grim Reapers keep showing up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This, right here, is finally 🍋 the, uh, first fortress. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And each of these fortresses is packed 🍋 with constantly regenerating enemies 🍊 as well as hard-to-avoid traps 🍋 and lots of dead ends. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The goal is to find the boss that's 🍋 actually hidden somewhere in the maze. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While similar in layout 🍋 to the dungeons of "...Zelda", 🍊 the "Kid Icarus..." dungeons are 🍋 actually very hard to navigate. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, as you can see, some screens 🍋 have quite a few enemies on them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the fortress, you [will] encounter 🍊 one of the most annoying 🍋 video game enemies ever created, 🍊 namely the eggplant wizard. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These guys can turn you 🍋 into an eggplant, 🍊 which leaves you 🍋 unable to fire your bow. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This means you'll have to 🍋 go find the hospital room, 🍊 get cured, 🍊 and then come all the way 🍋 back and try it again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm positive that 🍋 the eggplant wizards 🍊 have caused many players 🍊 to throw their joypads 🍋 at the T.V. in disgust. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here is the first boss, 🍋 right here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, throughout the 🍋 lev... -- fortress, 🍊 you actually use your, uh, 🍋 hammers to, uh, k... 🍊 smash statues and 🍋 get little helpers 🍊 that'll assist you in 🍋 defeating the bosses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These bosses are 🍋 not really that tough, 🍊 but they have a lot of hit points 🍋 and take a long time to defeat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 And definitely the bosses in 🍋 "Kid Icarus..." are not quite, uh, 🍊 "Castlevania" or "...Zelda"-quality. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I mentioned that "Kid Icarus..." 🍋 was actually based on "Metroid" 🍊 and was, in fact, designed 🍊 by the late Gunpei Yokoi 🍋 and his protege, Satoru Okada. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, after Yokoi left Nintendo, 🍊 Okada continued his work 🍋 in portable gaming 🍊 and is [pretty] much 🍋 the man behind 🍊 the Game Boy Advance 🍋 and the Nintendo D.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, all that being said, "...Icarus..." 🍋 is not really a "Metroid" *clone*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike "Metroid", 🍋 "Kid Icarus..." is completely linear 🍊 and doesn't really contain 🍋 any hidden items or secrets 🍊 or anything like that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, at first this might seem 🍋 like a step backwards, 🍊 but it is really [only] a... 🍋 proves that Yokoi and Nintendo 🍊 weren't really locked into one 🍋 particular s... gameplay style. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Kid Icarus..." ditches 🍋 the exploration 🍊 and instead focuses on sheer 🍋 difficulty of not getting killed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You are almost always in constant 🍋 danger of falling to your death 🍊 and in the fortress levels, 🍋 you are frequently bombarded 🍊 by more enemies [than 🍋 you can easily] handle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We actually, sort of, 🍋 have a little cameo, here, 🍊 from the metroids, themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, you know, in many ways, 🍊 "Kid Icarus..." actually gets easier 🍋 the further you get into the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As your Life Bar increases 🍋 and your weapons improve, 🍊 regular levels become 🍋 much less stressful 🍊 and actually the game 🍋 becomes [pretty] fun. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably the most striking thing 🍋 about the "Kid Icarus..." level design 🍊 is that the game is 🍋 almost completely vertical. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You start by climbing out of the, 🍋 uh, dark chambers of the underworld 🍊 to the surface and then 🍋 up to the heavens, as we are here, 🍊 which are decorated with all these, sort of, 🍋 Greco-Roman-style columns and statues, 🍊 and, again, plenty of places 🍋 to fall to your death. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The final level is a substantial 🍋 change of pace. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually a... a less than 🍋 spectacular horizontal Shoot-'em-Up, 🍊 followed by the main boss, 🍋 Medusa, herself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As with "Metroid", 🍋 the game has multiple endings, 🍊 depending on your stats 🍋 when you finish the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This final level is a bit disappointing, 🍊 but at least Medusa, herself, 🍋 is reasonably cool-looking. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, as folks who have played "...Zelda" know, 🍊 whenever you have an enemy that 🍋 has a big ol' eye like this, 🍊 you always gotta shoot 'em 🍋 right in the eye to kill 'em. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, "Kid Icarus..." was 🍋 [pretty] well received, 🍊 but never actually became 🍋 the [recurring] franchise, uh, 🍊 like 'Metroid' and 🍋 '...Mario...' and '...Zelda' did. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe this is because "Kid Icarus..." 🍊 never really scales the 🍋 same heights as those games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Kid Icarus..." is a flawed game, 🍋 but, uh, don't get me wrong; 🍊 it's still one of the 🍋 best games of 1986 🍊 and stands head and shoulders above 🍋 most of the Platforming competition, 🍊 such as "Wing of Madoola", 🍋 from last episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd say it's actually 🍋 certainly more enjoyable than 🍊 the other game from Nintendo 🍋 we'll be looking at, om, 🍊 which is actually the last game 🍋 we'll be seeing this episode. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, I'm gonna go ahead and say 🍊 that "Kid Icarus..." is the best game 🍋 of "Chrontendo Episode 14" 🍊 and, if you've never played it, 🍋 by all means give it a try. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just be prepared to actually 🍋 have quite a struggle 🍊 getting through the first, 🍋 uh, couple levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After you get past those, uh, 🍊 as long as you kill lots of enemies 🍋 and get lots of points, 🍊 you'll, uh, do [pretty] well. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kieta Princess 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 20 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Wave Jack
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Imagineer 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our next title is also an F.D.S. title. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And "Kieta Princess" 🍋 is another game from 🍊 Imagineer and Wave Jack - 🍋 the same team that brought you 🍊 the rather unusual Shooter/ 🍋 R.P.G. hybrid, "Ginga Denshou". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Kieta Princess' means 🍋 'Kidnapped Princess', I think, 🍊 and I believe that is 🍋 what this game is about. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One might be tempted to 🍋 look at that title screen 🍊 and think that "Kieta Princess" 🍊 is one of those charming and 🍋 under-appreciated Japan-[only] titles, 🍊 but, unfortunately, no. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Due to the amount of Japanese involved, 🍊 it would be impossible for a non- 🍋 Japanese-speaker to really play this game, 🍊 but I very seriously doubt 🍋 it's any good in any language. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game seems 🍋 vaguely "...Zelda"-esque. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's one of the 🍋 Action sequences 🍊 where your character navigates a rather 🍋 typical ladders and platforms setup. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though seemingly unarmed, 🍋 you are able to defend yourself 🍊 by shooting projectiles at 🍋 the bears which roam the halls. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 What's going on, here? 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 Where are you? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why are these bears 🍋 running around, 🍋 trying to kill you? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Boy, I -- 🍋 I really don't know. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One strange thing 🍋 about this game is, 🍊 just like 🍋 "Din..." -- "Ginga Denshou", 🍊 it really doesn't seem 🍋 to resemble, exactly, 🍊 any previous games, 🍊 even though it might remind 🍋 you of some earlier games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, playing this, 🍋 it's really hard to find 🍊 an exact example of a 🍋 game that's just like this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing 🍋 you should know - 🍊 it's very difficult to successfully 🍋 execute a jump in this level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Springboard, there, is virtually 🍋 impossible to use correctly 🍊 and simply jumping up 🍋 from one level to the next 🍊 is way more difficult 🍋 than it should be. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Believe it or not, you actually 🍋 can jump up one level, 🍊 like I'm trying to do here, 🍋 but it's so difficult 🍋 to actually pull off. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] took me a... 🍋 rather unusual number of time[s] 🍊 to actually find a way to 🍋 jump up one level in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the game also contains 🍋 some overworld sequences, 🍊 well, as we see right here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, you... 🍋 (as you can imagine) 🍋 ...you simply run around. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can interact with 🍋 various townspeople. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 You can amazingly 🍋 even kill townspeople, 🍊 though I'm not really sure what 🍋 effect this has on the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, typically, you can buy items 🍋 with the Yen that you've collected, 🍊 save your games, 🍊 and hopefully find clues 🍋 about the missing princess! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, another thing 🍋 that's kind of strange: 🍊 there seems to be a clock in 🍋 the lower right-hand corner 🍊 that's actually 🍋 running in real time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That is actually a... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Oops I just killed a guy, there, 🍋 and he turns into a little ghost!) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not sure what the 🍋 purpose of that clock is, 🍊 but it does actually, sort of, 🍋 count off the minutes in real time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, what exactly all these 🍋 different elements add up to, 🍊 I'm really not sure. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is clearly a, sort of, 🍊 "...Zelda"-esque 🍋 Action-Adventure Game 🍊 with some puzzles 🍋 of some sort in it, 🍊 but, uh, beyond that, 🍊 it's really hard to 🍋 make much sense of this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Layla 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 20 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by dB-Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by dB-Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey! This game actually has 🍋 some [pretty] decent music. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 From dB-SOFT, it is "Layla" - 🍋 a Science Fiction themed side scroller 🍊 (sort of a Run-'n'-Gun type title)! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 dB-SOFT was not the most prolific 🍋 developer for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The last game we saw 🍋 from them was "Galg", 🍋 back in December of 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Galg", as you might recall, 🍋 was that sort of R.P.G.-esque, 🍋 S... uh -- Shoot-'em-Up title. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 They seem to like Science Fiction themes 🍋 and "Layla" is no exception. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's sort of like a low-rent 🍋 version of "Metroid". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You play this well-armed young woman, 🍋 who seems to have the job of 🍊 clearing out these asteroids 🍋 of any form of alien life. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, unlike the rather 🍋 business-like Samus Aran, 🍊 Layla has a sweet tooth 🍊 and finds time to gobble down 🍋 slices of cake and ice cream cones 🍊 in between blasting creatures 🍋 and collecting ammunition. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Occasionally, [she'll] even 🍋 pick up {a} pair of *roller* skates. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, Layla is definitely not 🍋 your typical space-hunter girl. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing this game does 🍋 have is lots of ammo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'll try to blow up some of 🍋 those crates with a grenade. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah! There's some roller skates, 🍋 as I mentioned. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You often have to 🍋 use your, uh, blaster 🍊 to shoot through, uh, 🍋 things blocking your way. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one weird thing 🍋 about this game is - 🍊 the character is absurdly 🍋 loaded down with weapons 🍊 (you find pistols, rocket launchers, 🍋 flame throwers, grenades, swords, 🍊 and axes - all kinds of things). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Layla" is really sort of a predecessor 🍋 to the titles like "DooM", 🍊 where you walk around with an entire 🍋 arsenal strapped on your back. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, if you think about it, 🍊 most games at this time, didn't 🍋 let you collect a lot of weapons 🍊 - usually two at most. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Think of "Commando", "Castlevania", - 🍋 those sorts of things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Shoot-'em-Ups were starting to 🍋 have lots of special weapons 🍊 but selecting a new one would 🍋 usually cause the old one to disappear 🍊 (for example, in games like "Zanac"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not so with "Layla", 🍊 where you can collect weapons and 🍋 ammunition to your heart's content. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We are now in, sort of, one of these 🍋 little, sort of, warehouse-like areas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Layla" doesn't really have *levels*, 🍋 so [to] speak. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each asteroid contains a 🍋 number of different sections. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some are long; some are short 🍊 and you simply go across them 🍋 until you come to the elevator. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I like the fact that this is 🍋 booby-trapped with these, uh, 🍊 gigantic thirty ton weights, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 You can see all the different 🍋 weapons that you have. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's, like, a throwing dagger, right there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 dB-SOFT tended to make these unique, 🍋 if not great, games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll think of "Galg", for example. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍋🍓 And "Layla" is actually [pretty] good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All those different elements 🍋 add a sense of fun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can sort of explore around 🍋 and see what different weapons do. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 The actual execution isn't 🍋 really that exciting. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 The game does suffer from 🍋 repetition [of] the levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You tend to move through a 🍋 bunch of almost-identical caves 🍊 and these futuristic 🍋 warehouse-like levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also sort of annoying - 🍊 when your health gets low the 🍋 fleen -- screen starts flashing red. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 This makes it kind of difficult 🍋 to concentrate on what you're doing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For the most part, though, 🍋 the game controls well, 🍊 even though the floors seem 🍋 a little bit too slippery. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Often it's sometimes [pretty] difficult 🍊 to shoot blocks or walls 🍋 that are right at head level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently, this is what 🍋 I came in here looking for. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not sure what exactly that is, 🍊 but it's obviously the object that you 🍋 need to find at the end of every level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yes, and there's also 🍋 a boss fight coming up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The bosses seem reasonably 🍋 well-designed, if not exceptional, 🍊 though I suppose that picture 🍋 of the guy in the background 🍊 has something to do with 🍋 the plot of the story. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In between levels, you'll find 🍋 these little bonus stages, uh, 🍊 where you fly around 🍋 on your space bike 🍊 and it's sort of like a 🍋 little mini Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You actually can't get killed; 🍋 you simply, uh, shoot aliens for points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you shoot all of them in a row, 🍋 you get, uh, more and more points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Layla" is a fun, 🍋 playable little title 🍊 that goes a little beyond your 🍋 typical formulaic side-scroller. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd say it's definitely worth checking out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's really too bad that dB-SOFT 🍋 didn't make more games for the FamiCom, 🍊 because, just like Sunsoft, they seem 🍋 [to] be, sort of, improving in quality. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As it stands, I think the, uh, 🍊 company stopped making games, 🍋 sometime in the, uh, 1980s. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Cosmo Genesis 🇯🇵 // Star Voyager 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 23 🇯🇵 // 1987 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ASCII
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 // Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ugh! Speaking of Sci-Fi games, 🍋 here's one I don't like. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Cosmo Genesis" has a 🍋 catchy musical theme 🍊 and a [pretty] wicked logo 🍋 on the title screen, 🍊 but that just sets your 🍋 expectations too high! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It even has a nice little introduction 🍊 where it shows your guy 🍋 getting into the ship. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It seems like the old 🍊 'hop into the ship and blast 🍋 off into outer space' intro 🍊 would become standard for 🍋 Shoot-'em-Ups in later years. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Not so much in 1986, however. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a nice little touch. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, once the game 🍋 itself actually starts, 🍊 you'll find it's just another clone 🍋 of "Star Raiders", the old Atari game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Namco had already released a 🍋 "Star Raiders" clone for the FamiCom, 🍊 called "Star Luster", back in 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Namco's game was decent, 🍋 but certainly not exceptional. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Cosmo Genesis", on the other hand, 🍋 is simply a pain in the ass to play. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You might be familiar with this title, 🍊 because it was released in the U.S. 🍋 as "Star Voyager" in 1987 🍊 and had the distinction of being 🍊 one of the very first games 🍋 released by the notorious Acclaim, 🍊 for the Nintendo. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For those who don't recall 🍋 "Star Raiders", it is very simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Look at the, uh, radar screen, 🍋 warp to the enemy's location, 🍊 and then destroy all the 🍋 ships in that sector. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can refuel and repair your ships 🍋 at the various space stations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The enemy ships will be busy 🍊 trying to blow up your 🍋 home base or something, 🍊 so you need to really get cracking! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This, right here, is actually what it 🍋 looks like to dock with a space station. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 As is [typical] for -- 🍋 for these kind of games, 🍊 it's usually kind of a [laughs] 🍋 slow and tedious process. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I actually don't need to 🍋 dock to the space station 🍊 because I, um, still have, 🍋 [pretty] much... quite a bit of fuel. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's, uh... 🍋 Well, there's two fuel gauges. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's one in the 🍋 upper right-hand corner 🍊 and then one along 🍋 the right-hand side. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I believe the one in the 🍋 upper right-hand corner 🍊 represent, like, actual 🍋 fuel tanks or something. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing you might 🍋 notice about this game is, 🍊 while it does have opening music, 🍊 the game itself doesn't really 🍋 have any music at all - 🍊 just some rather lame 🍋 little sound effects. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So what's wrong with this game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, first of all, 🍋 for example, take warping. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, you go ahead and use a D-Pad 🍊 to move your, uh, cursor around 🍋 to where you want to go to. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Those little 'X's represent enemy ships. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But then it's unnecessarily complicated. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to accelerate all the way 🍋 (or almost all the way) 🍊 and then hold down the button 🍊 for the correct number of cells 🍋 to appear in the upper left, 🍊 based on how far the trip is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, it's nine units 🍋 (whatever that is). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you get to nine cells, 🍊 then you need to release the button 🍋 and you'll start warping. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then, once you get really 🍋 close to where you're going, 🍊 hold down the button again and you'll 🍋 exit, uh, hyperspace (or wherever you are). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And sometimes you can actually 🍋 not end up in the right location 🍊 because you can get 🍋 blown off course. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently, some sectors have high 🍋 solar winds or something like that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the fact that you 🍋 have to do all this stuff 🍊 simply to warp around, 🍋 from one area to another, 🍊 doesn't really negate... make the game 🍋 any more realistic or deep or anything. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It basically just, uh, makes it 🍋 one more thing you have to do. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 M'kay, I'm at the right spot and 🍋 there's enemy ships approaching, 🍊 as your little message thing says there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It actually takes 'em quite 🍋 a while to actually appear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess you sorta have to 🍋 fly around and find 'em. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However the combat is actually [pretty] painful. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The enemy ships fly around very fast 🍋 and the animation is [pretty] jerky, 🍊 so I really can't always 🍋 tell what's going on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once we actually find [some] ships I'm 🍋 sure you'll see what I'm talking about. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Warping uses up a lot of fuel 🍊 and getting hit really sucks 🍋 around a, uh, huge amount of fuel, 🍊 so you'll end up having to go back and 🍋 dock at space stations quite frequently. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I usually get killed [pretty] 🍋 quickly, upon engaging enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are a few new elements to this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, you can activate shields, 🍋 which turns space green. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you can find power-ups on the various 🍋 planets found throughout the solar system. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, this will not compensate for the 🍋 fact that most of the game is [pretty] horrible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe that's why Acclaim 🍋 wanted to release this game 🍊 - they felt it was somehow tied 🍋 into their own video game standards. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, I actually... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I guess I've [pretty] much 🍋 been killed already. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, yeah, this is def... -- 🍋 definitely one that 🍊 you'll probably want to 🍋 stay well away from. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's, uh, really not nearly as good 🍊 as some of the games that ASCII has 🍋 already released for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Trainer: Running Stadium 🇯🇵 // Stadium Events | World Class Track Meet 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 23 🇯🇵 // 1987 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 // Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Family Trainer: Running Stadium" 🍋 is the second in Bandai's 🍋 'Family Trainer' series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We covered the first game, 🍋 "Athletic World", just a few episodes ago. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Family Trainer Pad is the Japanese 🍋 equivalent of the U.S. Power Pad 🍊 and, just like in that first game, 🍊 you run on the pad in order 🍋 to make your character move. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This first event here is just a 🍋 very simple, uh, two person sprint. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, "Family Trainer..." is 🍋 much more notorious, 🍊 due to the game's release history, 🍋 rather than the game itself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first U.S. release 🍋 was by Bandai themselves, 🍊 under the name "Stadium Events". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This version was [only] sold in 🍋 some regional 'Woolworth' stores 🍊 and for a *very* brief *time*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As a result, the Bandai "Stadium Events" 🍊 is the rarest of all the officially released 🍋 Nintendo Entertainment System titles 🍊 and copies go for outrageous amounts 🍋 of money whenever they surface. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The reason why "Stadium Events" was on 🍋 the market for such a short period of time 🍊 was that Nintendo had 🍊 just bought the U.S. rights to the 🍋 Family Trainer Pad and this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo eventually released 🍋 the Power Pad in the U.S. 🍊 and "Stadium Events" was re-titled 🍊 and given a wide release under 🍋 the name "World Class Track Meet". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Nintendo version, 🍋 just like the original Japanese version, 🍊 is a [pretty] easy title to find. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as for the game itself, 🍊 well, it's essentially a first-person 🍋 version of Konami's "Track & Field", 🍊 with racing, jumping, 🍋 and hurdle competitions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the 'Family Trainer' games 🍊 were actually developed 🍋 by the company, Human, 🍊 and they actually do a really 🍋 nice job with the pseudo-3D effects 🍊 and there are some very nice details. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, look at all the little 🍋 shadows and everything in this event. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "...Running Stadium" is a nicely 🍋 done up Family Trainer/Power Pad game 🍊 that has ended up being completely 🍊 overshadowed by the collectablity 🍋 of one of the release variants. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But as a Power Pad game, 🍋 it actually works [pretty] well. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tatakai no Banka 🇯🇵 // Trojan 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 24 🇯🇵 // 1987 February [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Released on Christmas Eve is 🍋 Capcom's "Tatakai no Banka" 🍊 (which might be translated 🍋 as 'War Requiem'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the U.S. this game 🍋 was known as "Trojan". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Never heard of the game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, that's not surprising, 🍋 since it really didn't do as... 🍊 nearly as well as other Capcom 🍋 titles released around this time, 🍊 such as "Ghosts 'n Goblins" 🍋 or "Commando". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Released in arcades in 1986, 🍊 "Trojan" is a side-scrolling 🍋 proto-Beat-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game takes place in a 🍋 post-apocalyptic New York. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Armed with a sword and shield, 🍊 you take on an endless 🍋 tide of bad guys. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's the FamiCom version, 🍋 ported by Capcom themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It actually looks okay, plays [pretty] 🍋 similarly to the Arcade version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Mostly, you just walk to the right 🍋 and kill guys with your sword. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Dropping down the manhole will 🍋 actually allow you to fight this guy 🍊 and then score a pair 🍋 of High Jump Boots. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately they can [only] 🍋 be used around three times 🍊 before they wear off. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, actually, I guess 🍋 it'd be four times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have to use them once to 🍋 actually get out of the manhole. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can then use them to 🍋 take out the little guys 🍊 that hide up in the windows, 🍋 there, and throw dynamite at you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Each level will usually 🍋 have about a couple bosses 🍊 and then you're off 🍋 to the next level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Those guys are still [pretty] hard to hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oops! Now my... my Jump Boots are gone. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 These first guys are [pretty] easy; 🍋 just whack 'em with a sword. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Trojan" will probably remind you 🍋 a lot of "Ghosts 'n Goblins", 🍊 right down to the map at 🍋 the beginning of each level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, this game seems 🍋 more or less like an unsuccessful 🍊 attempt to make a second game 🍋 in the "Ghosts 'n Goblins" mold. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But "Trojan" is simply not 🍋 as fun as "Ghosts 'n Goblins"! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually, frustratingly hard at times 🍊 and, sort of, lacks the kind of 🍋 personality that "Ghosts 'n Goblins" had. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We're coming up to the next boss 🍋 here, in just a second, 🍊 and he's actually quite a bit tougher. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He can block your hits and 🍋 will fire projectiles at you; 🍊 the projectile can hit you 🍋 either high or low. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It'll often turn around and hit you 🍋 in the back, after it's passed you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He sometimes fires short projectiles 🍋 and sometimes, uh, long ones. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The short ones will hit you immediately. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And ya have to get [pretty] close 🍋 to him to hit him with your sword 🍊 and so he can blast 🍋 you at point blank. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now we're onto the next level, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 The main problem with this game, 🍋 though, is the control scheme. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One button's used to swing your sword, 🍋 the other one to hold up your shield. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This means that, in order to jump, 🍋 you need to press Up on the D-Pad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Considering you have to do a lot of 🍋 jumping, especially on the bosses, 🍊 this makes your character 🍋 [pretty] difficult to control. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If they had stuck with the, uh, 🍊 classic "Ghosts 'n Goblins" 🍋 control scheme for ducking and jumping, 🍊 "Trojan" might have been 🍋 a [pretty] cool little game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As it stands, however, "Trojan" 🍋 will remain a little-known game, 🍊 surrounded by much better 🍋 releases from Capcom. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Seikima II 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 25 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ISCO
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by CBS/Sony Inc. 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Released on Christmas day, it's "Seikima II". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And what a wonderful Christmas present 🍋 for the people of Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your first thought might be, 🍋 '"Seikima II"? What about "Seikima (I)"?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, no, 'Seikima II' is the 🍋 name of a Japanese rock band 🍊 who dressed in ridiculous 🍋 KISS-like outfits and makeup. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The name is actually 🍋 a sort of pun 🍊 since 'seikimatsu' means 🍋 'end of the century' in Japanese. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The band apparently had 🍋 some sort of backstory 🍊 about being demons who were 🍋 announcing the end of the world 🍊 or something like that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, hell, games like this? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is why we're actually 🍋 playing every single FamiCom game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What could be more delightful 🍋 than discovering a game based on 🍊 some obscure old 1980s 🍋 Japanese KISS rip-off? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, that's not to 🍋 say this is a good game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Far from it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] irritating Platformer, 🍊 [in] which you need to collect 🍋 every object on the screen, 🍊 which include ghosts, and 🍋 apparently, band member heads, 🍊 in order to, uh, move on 🍋 to the next level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One odd thing... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure that Konami had 🍋 nothing at all to do with this 🍊 yet "Seikima II" seems to borrow 🍋 the sprite of the holy water 🍊 from "Castlevania", 🍋 as well as the Moai heads. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 They make an appearance as 🍋 an indestructible enemy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The actual developer of 🍋 this game was I.S.C.O. 🍊 (which means 🍋 'Intelligent System Corporation'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You probably haven't 🍋 heard of them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They're a reasonably obscure 🍋 Japanese contract developer 🍊 and I think this was 🍋 one of their first games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They continued to 🍋 develop games until 🍋 at least the late 1990s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think they might still be around, 🍋 but really not as a video game company. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Perhaps more noteworthy is that this is 🍋 the first FamiCom game from C.B.S./Sony. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Sony had already been releasing 🍋 games for the M.S.X. computers 🍊 (which makes sense because they 🍋 actually manufactured M.S.X. computers) 🍊 but this was really their first foray 🍋 into the Japanese home console market. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously they would eventually become 🍋 Nintendo's biggest rival in that department. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, of course, no one could have possibly 🍋 guessed that, looking by this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, here we are in the second level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly enough, all the 🍋 money bags you collect 🍊 actually, uh, have Dollar signs, 🍋 rather than Yen signs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, throughout the game, you do accrue 🍋 funds and you can spend them in shops. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 One thing that, sort of, gets a little 🍋 bit irritating about this game is, 🍊 when you get low on health 🍊 this incredibly annoying little, uh, 🍋 bleeping noise starts, to let you know. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] actually take quite a few hits, 🍋 but you will get hit quite a few times, 🍊 simply because of the number of enemies 🍊 that inevitably drop down, from 🍋 the top of the screen, onto you, 🍊 and the fact that your character 🍋 has a really weird jumping motion. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's the shop screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 Um... 🍊 One thing you need 🍋 to buy are the guitars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you get all of them 🍋 for all your band members, 🍊 uh, you actually get 🍋 the ending of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, no, this is 🍋 definitely not a good game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 It's perhaps worth taking a look at, 🍋 just for the weird novelty value, but, uh, 🍊 this is [pretty] indicative of the, kind of, 🍋 very, sort of, minor, uh, 🍊 not very well designed Platformers 🍋 that were being released for the FamiCom, 🍊 at this time (and would 🍋 continue to be released for a while). 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Professional Mahjong Goku 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 25 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Chat Noir
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, we fired up the F.D.S., 🍋 here, for another Mahjong Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is "Professional Mahjong Goku", 🍋 as a matter of fact. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This title was released by ASCII, 🍊 but, as you may have seen 🍋 on the title screen there, 🍊 it was actually developed by 🍋 a company called 'Chat Noir'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They're a rather obscure little 🍋 Japanese development company 🍊 that seem to specialize in Mahjong Games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Mahjong, as I'm sure you know, 🍋 is quite popular in Japan 🍊 and this is actually the third Mahjong 🍋 Game released for the FamiCom, 🍊 which is really not that many. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Altogether, there would be over 🍊 a dozen Mahjong titles released 🍋 for the FamiCom during its lifespan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this one looks (well, to my eyes) 🍋 [pretty] much like all the rest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't really play Mahjong and as... 🍊 I don't really know how to judge 🍋 whether this is a good game or not. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now remember, this is called 🍋 "Professional Mahjong Goku", 🍊 so there's gotta be some sort of 🍋 additional element in it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's actually a few 🍋 different gameplay modes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This one seems to be the standard, 🍊 but, uh, there is a ma... -- mode 🍋 where you [can] actually *gamble*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 {I} guess you have some settings, here, you 🍋 have to set up before you can actually play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then, once the game starts, 🍋 it allows you to, apparently, place bets. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, it's actually a four-person 🍋 Mahjong Game, for this mode right here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Mahjong is, of course, a -- a form of 🍋 gambling and is normally played for money. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, beyond that, I really don't 🍋 have much to say about this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 I suppose that this is, uh, 🍋 simply notable for being, uh, 🍊 one of the, uh, earlier 🍋 Mahjong Games on the system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll be seeing plenty more of these. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Arkanoid 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 26 🇯🇵 // 1987 August [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Last episode we reviewed 🍋 "Nazo no Kabe", (a.k.a. "Crackout") 🍊 Konami's "Arkanoid"-inspired game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this episode we have a 🍋 home version of "Arkanoid" itself, 🍊 released on the FamiCom a 🍋 mere 13 days after "Nazo no Kabe". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Funny how that works sometimes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As we mentioned last episode, "Arkanoid" 🍋 was a 1986 arcade hit from Taito, 🍊 which updated the formula of 🍋 the old Atari game, "Breakout". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Due to the huge success 🍋 of the Arcade game, 🍊 it was quickly ported to the 🍋 M.S.X. and the FamiCom, in Japan, 🍊 and then eventually to [pretty] much 🍋 every home computer system known to man. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Arkanoid"'s primary additions 🍋 to the old "Breakout" formula 🍊 are the addition of various power-ups 🍋 that drop down occasionally 🍊 and the much more 🍋 complicated block patterns. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This FamiCom version is [pretty] 🍋 faithful to the Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It looks virtually identical. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The one main subtraction is the fact 🍋 that you don't have that cool, 🍊 sort of, animated intro during 🍋 the, uh -- the title screen, there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now the various power-ups 🍋 will do things like, uh, 🍊 slow down the speed of the ball, 🍋 as we see here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a dark blue one that'll 🍋 actually make your ship longer, 🍊 making it easier to hit the ball. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Another one'll give you multiple 🍋 balls in the air at the same time, 🍊 and so on so forth. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also these enemies that 🍋 will now float down from the ceiling; 🍊 occasionally you'll have to hit those. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's even a final level 🍊 that consists of a boss character 🍋 which takes multiple hits to destroy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The home versions of "Arkanoid" 🍋 (both in the U.S. and Japan) 🍊 were released with a special 🍋 rotary knob "Arkanoid" controller. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This makes the game a lot 🍋 more enjoyable to play, 🍊 as it's really difficult to accurately 🍋 control your ship using the standard joypad. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another addition to the 🍋 old "Breakout" formula: 🍊 Some blocks will take 🍋 multiple hits to destroy 🍊 and a lot of levels have 🍋 indestructible blocks 🍊 (for example, 🍋 the gold ones we see right here). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the second-to-last level 🍋 before meeting the boss, himself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The levels are not nearly as 🍋 complicated as the Konami game, 🍊 but, uh, still "Arkanoid" 🍋 is a lot of fun to play, 🍊 especially if you have 🍋 the "Arkanoid" controller. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly enough, this boss 🍋 looks like something that 🍋 belongs in a Konami game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Arkanoid" actually has 🍋 some sort of plot and, 🍊 after defeating the boss, 🍋 you'll get sort of a story wrap up, 🍊 which doesn't really make any sense. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Maybe it's badly trap... -- 🍋 translated from the Japanese. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, we'll say 🍊 "Arkanoid", yeah, it's a 🍋 [pretty] good Arcade game 🍊 that was made into a [pretty] 🍋 accurate home conversion, 🍊 definitely worth playing, especially 🍋 if you have the "Arkanoid" controller. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Without that, you might find 🍋 the game a bit challenging. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Electrician 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 26 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Synapse Software
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing about Kemco: 🍋 They are nothing if not unpredictable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They managed to release 🍋 two games on December 26th 🍊 and the first one we'll 🍋 take a look at is "Electrician". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is actually a [pretty] good, 🍋 uh, title screen here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Kemco's past releases have 🍋 been all over the place 🍊 but they were mostly junk. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Electrician" is a surprisingly fun 🍋 old-school game, 🍊 but it was a real 🍋 'out of left field' release. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a port of a [pretty] obscure 🍋 game from Synapse Software, 🍊 originally for the Atari 🍋 computers, back in 1984. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I have no idea what made Kemco decide 🍋 to port "Electrician" to the FamiCom, 🍊 but it turned out to be 🍋 a reasonably good idea. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, yes, this is a 🍋 FamiCom Disk System release 🍊 (remember, of course, that 🍋 these were actually cheaper 🍋 to make than cartridges) 🍊 so, you can actually save your game, 🍊 which seems a little 🍋 weird for this kind of game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Electrician" starts with New York City 🍊 suddenly suffering massive damage 🍋 to its electrical infrastructure, 🍊 plunging the entire city into darkness. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In real life, this would probably result 🍋 in a state of emergency being declared, 🍊 but in this game, they decided 🍋 to send out a single electrician 🍊 to rewire every building, one at a time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And that electrician is you! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You use one button to lay 🍋 down wire to each room and 🍋 the other button to jump! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to connect both 🍋 rooms entirely by wire. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's usually, uh, nodes at the top 🍋 and nodes at the bottom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've got one room wired, 🍋 "Blam!", it lights up! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Along the way, you'll encounter 🍋 various wire-eating vermin, 🍊 such as caterpillars, rats, 🍋 and surprisingly large spiders. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a difficulty 🍋 setting on here - the speed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I have it at Low. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Setting it at High will make 🍋 the game much more challenging 🍊 (almost impossibly so). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The levels are not too large - 🍊 usually less than 🍋 half a dozen rooms tall. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Occasionally, lighting up a room 🍋 will let r... uh -- release a burglar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And if any of the vermin 🍋 actually cross a live wire 🍊 (represented by yellow wires, 🍋 as opposed to green) 🍊 they will get zapped. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for some reason, 🍋 you utilize the maze-like sewer systems, 🍊 in order to travel from 🍋 one building to the next. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every other level is one of 🍋 these underground levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We have the first one here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For some reason, they decided to place 🍋 walls randomly in the sewer tunnels, 🍊 making it more difficult to get around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Synapse Software was 🍋 an American game developer 🍊 that began making games for the 🍋 Atari systems in the early 1980s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By 1984, they had fallen on hard times, 🍋 due to the Video Game Crash, 🍊 and were acquired by Brøderbund. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Shortly thereafter, 🍋 they disappeared for good. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Brøderbund had already been licensing 🍊 games, such as "Lode Runner", 🍋 to Japanese publishers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Presumably Kemco wanted another game 🍋 on the market for the holiday season 🍊 and they got a really 🍋 good deal on this one. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Admittedly, this game 🍋 is not fantastic, 🍊 but it's a lot better than 🍋 earlier titles like "Dough Boy". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One huge failing 🍋 in the game, however, 🍋 is the rather difficult 🍋 jumping controls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Avoiding enemies 🍋 is not that tough, 🍋 but jumping 🍋 across the gaps are 🍊 and I've plummeted 🍋 to my death 🍋 many times on this thing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, all in all, 🍋 how do we feel about "Electrician"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, like I mentioned, 🍋 it's definitely not a great game, 🍊 but it is sort of charming in 🍋 an old-fashioned kind of way. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a style of game that was 🍋 really sort of disappearing, uh, 🍊 as the FamiCom saw more and more 🍋 modern-style platform games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I have no idea who actually 🍋 did this port to the FamiCom 🍊 (I don't think Kemco, 🍋 themselves, did it) 🍋 but it is surprisingly well done. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Crazy Climber 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 26 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nichibutsu
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nichibutsu 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 December 26th saw the release of two 🍋 games packaged with special controllers: 🍊 "Arkanoid" and "Crazy Climber". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the port of the old 🍋 (but very awesome) 🍋 1980 Nichibutsu Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nichibutsu had already released 🍋 FamiCom versions of their other titles, 🍊 such as "Terra Cresta", but "Crazy Climber" 🍋 was perhaps their defining moment. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is clearly inspired by the 🍋 'human fly' craze of the late '70s 🍊 (most notably, George Willig climbing 🍋 the World Trade Center in 1977). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Arcade game had a rather 🍋 unique two-joystick control system 🍊 (one for each hand) 🍊 and this made a rather 🍋 simple concept a lot of fun! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, thus, uh, the release of, 🍋 uh, this game for the FamiCom, 🍊 in Japan [only], was packaged with a 🍋 special "Crazy Climber" controller. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For those of you not familiar 🍋 with the actual game, 🍊 basically you simply climb up the, 🍋 uh, side of this very tall building, 🍊 watching out for people 🍋 dropping objects on you, 🍊 windows closing, and later - 🍋 things like giant gorillas. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, unfortunately, 🍊 playing this without the special 🍋 controller is not really an option. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you use emulation, 🍋 you can probably rig something up, 🍊 but the game is not really going to be a lot 🍋 of fun without the correct set of controllers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably the best way to 🍋 experience "Crazy Climber" 🍊 (other than owning an 🍋 original Arcade version) 🍊 is to, uh, plug a double 🍋 joystick system into MAME. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Toki no Tabibito: Time Stranger 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 26 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Kemco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game starts off with some 🍋 crazy "Suspiria"-like music 🍊 and it's the last game we'll be 🍋 looking at for the year 1986: 🍊 "Toki no Tabibito". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And check out those crazy hot pink gloves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A word of advice: 🍊 It's hard to look bad ass, 🍋 wearing gloves like that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now this game is a FamiCom original 🍊 and it's based on 🍋 an animated movie 🍋 of the same name, 🍋 which came out in 1986. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Judging by the poster, 🍊 I don't think the movie 🍋 resembles the video game 🍋 very much. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like "Electrician", 🍋 it's not really clear 🍋 who developed this game 🍊 - whether or not it was 🍋 Kemco or someone else. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Regardless, "Time Stranger" 🍋 will probably be 🍊 of little interest to a 🍋 non-Japanese-speaker. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is more or less 🍋 a Text Adventure Game, 🍊 but it's not very complicated - 🍊 certainly nothing along 🍋 the lines of "Portopia". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The gameplay simply consists 🍋 of talking to various figures 🍊 from Japanese history, such as, uh, 🍋 Oda Nobunaga or General Tojo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character is 🍋 some kind of time cop 🍊 who mostly travels forward 🍋 in Japanese history 🍊 and stops at various 🍋 important events, 🍊 such as the Ikedaya Affair 🍋 or the Battle of Sekigahara. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game occasionally has 🍋 little third-person scenes, 🍊 such as this one right here, 🍊 but there's really 🍋 not that much to them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's really no 🍋 Action in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You do have to stand 🍋 underneath your, uh, 🍋 spaceship's beam 🍊 in order to get sucked 🍋 back up into the spaceship; 🍊 otherwise the game ends. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Comp... -- But, compared 🍋 to most Adventure Games, 🍋 this game is [pretty] simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You're limited strictly 🍋 to Yes or No answers, 🍋 uh, which is what you, 🍋 uh, see right there 🍊 - those two boxes with the little 🍋 pink dot that goes back and forth. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Compared to something like "Portopia", 🍋 there's really not that much to it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 You can't really, like, 🍋 walk around, find objects, 🍊 [only] to talk to one person 🍋 at any given time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is [pretty] simple, uh, 🍋 as compared to most Adventure Games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, here's Tojo, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He has that funny little, uh, 🍊 framed picture of Adolf Hitler 🍋 on his mantle place there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The one unusual thing 🍋 about this game is 🍊 it actually has, 🍋 sort of, branching paths. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Depending on what answers you give, 🍊 the game will actually 🍋 give you a different ending. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is unusual, of course, and 🍋 might give the game replay value, 🍊 but it still seems like a 🍋 relatively short simple game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And with that we have 🍋 wrapped up 1986. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, let's move on to 🍋 the grand year of 1987. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to 1987 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Wow! So we're finally 🍋 done with 1986 and into 1987, 🍊 which is the fifth year 🍋 of the FamiCom's existence. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Normally Japanese 🍋 video game publishers 🍋 seem to slow down 🍋 after the holiday season, 🍊 but at this point the 🍋 FamiCom was so popular they 🍋 just kept releasing games, 🍊 even in early January! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 1986 was a [pretty] 🍋 monumental year for the system 🍊 and we'll have to do 🍋 a wrap up of the year, 🍊 at some point in the 🍋 near -- near future. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [There's] really not 🍋 enough time this episode. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And 1987 will turn out 🍋 to be just as notable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So let's start with the games! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hi no Tori Hououhen: Gaou no Bouken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 January 04 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 1987 opens with a new 🍋 game from Konami! Hurray! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But this game isn't really that great. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, it's based on 🍋 a licensed property 🍊 and maybe doesn't really have the 🍋 typical Konami attention to detail. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Still, it is {an} [interesting] title. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Hi no Tori Hououhen" is based on 🍋 a serialized manga from Osamu Tezuka, 🍊 that originally ran in 1969 and 1970. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Tezuka was a prolific writer and artist 🍊 and probably the most important and 🍋 influential figure in manga history. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Certainly his most well-known 🍋 creation is 'Astro Boy'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The original comic took place 🍋 in 8th century Japan 🍊 and concerns a wandering 🍋 one-armed bandit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not coincidentally, 🍋 there was an animated 🍋 feature released in 1986. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This episode is [only] one story 🍋 from the 'Hi no Tori' series 🍊 that was released over 🍋 a period of twenty years. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Not surprisingly, 🍋 this game doesn't really 🍋 follow the original plot, 🍊 but is simply a scrolling Platformer 🍋 - sort of in the "Castlevania" mold. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character, Gaou, 🍊 travels through 🍋 various lands 🍊 and encounters 🍋 all sorts of enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from firing a projectile, 🍊 his main talent is the ability 🍋 to generate a little block, 🍊 which can be used as a step. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This seems very similar 🍋 to "Solomon no Kage". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hitting an enemy will cause 🍋 him to turn into a block, uh, 🍊 which you can then collect, 🍋 as long as it's still in motion, 🍊 because at any given time, you 🍋 have a limited number of blocks, 🍊 as shown in the counter up at 🍋 the top of the screen there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like "Castlevania", you face a 🍋 different boss at the end of each level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This first guy, here, is 🍋 really not that hard to defeat, 🍊 as long as you create a little 🍋 staircase in order to reach him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I'm] not sure exactly what he's supposed 🍋 to be but he is reasonably cool looking. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And these boss battles will probably 🍋 remind you quite a bit of "Castlevania". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After defeating the boss, you receive 🍋 a piece of a painting of the 'Hi no Tori'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 Incidentally 'Hi no Tori' is usually 🍋 translated into 'Phoenix' in English 🍊 and that's what the painting is of. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, while "Castlevania" 🍋 was [pretty] straightforward, 🍊 "Hi no Tori" does get a little 🍋 trickier, as the game progresses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In order to finish it, 🍊 you need to find hidden levels 🍋 by uncovering hidden doors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So this game is sort of 🍋 like "Castlevania", uh, 🍊 crossed with elements 🍋 of "King Kong 2" 🍊 (not that I've ever 🍋 been able to finish it). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game does look [pretty] good; 🍊 {it} has sort of a limited color scheme, 🍋 as was, uh, typical. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game does look an 🍋 awful lot like "Castlevania", 🍊 with, sort of, the, uh, you know, 🍊 kind of, weird shadows and, uh, b... -- 🍋 backgrounds and whatnot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I assume that Konami developed 🍋 this game themselves, 🍊 even though this doesn't 🍋 really quite seem like a, uh, 🍊 Grade-A Konami project. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, here's the second boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's some sort of rock kind of guy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe a little trickier than the first one, 🍊 but probably still 🍋 nothing you can't deal with. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the bosses here are [pretty] 🍋 nice-looking, as you can see. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 All in all, this is [pretty] a sol... 🍋 -- [pretty] much a solid game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Definitely not the best 🍋 Konami has ever done. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The main selling point to Japanese audiences 🍋 is undoubtedly the manga/anime tie-in, 🍊 but you'll probably find 🍋 something to enjoy here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, while this game does, sort of, have 🍋 a, uh, 'treading water' kind of feel to it, 🍊 Konami was... 🍋 definitely had other things in mind. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, we're gonna see 🍋 a game from them next episode 🍊 that is completely different than 🍋 anything they've released so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dragon Buster 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 January 07 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Namco decides to usher 🍋 in the new year by... 🍊 dusting off an old Arcade game 🍋 and porting it to the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yep! It's "Dragon Buster", 🍋 a port of Namco's 1984 Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not very well known 🍋 (at least in the U.S.) 🍊 the Arcade "Dragon Buster" 🍋 was a little ahead of its time 🍊 and was [pretty] impressive 🍋 upon release. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Dragon Buster" was 🍋 an early side-scroller, 🍊 just like "Pac-Land" and actually 🍋 used the "Pac-Land" hardware. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It was one of the first games 🍋 [to] use a Health Meter 🍊 (as you notice the Vitality 🍋 Bar in the corner, there) 🍊 instead of r... -- regular lives, 🍊 and had a Fantasy theme, back before 🍋 this was common in video games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It also used an overworld-style 🍋 map between levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see here, much of the 🍋 game involves busting dragons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's the FamiCom release. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The actual object of the game 🍊 is to make your way through various 🍋 caves and mountains, towers, et cetera. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Each level has sub-bosses to defeat, 🍊 like that little dinosaur-type 🍋 thing we just killed there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, after killing a boss, 🍊 you'll receive some sort of helpful 🍋 item - usually a one-time-use spell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there we have a wizard, 🍋 with another helpful spell. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After getting through each level, 🍋 you'll be transported to the overworld. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And these screens allow you to 🍋 select your path to the castle, 🍊 making this an example of, uh, very 🍋 basic non-linner -- linearity in games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can see this in action right here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You're armed primarily with a sword, 🍋 with which you can use several attacks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, you can jump over 🍋 someone and do a downward thrust 🍊 and you can also cast spells 🍋 to do damage to an enemy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here we are in the castle and 🍋 here's the first dragon boss 🍊 - definitely the toughest boss in the game, 🍊 since his fire attack makes it difficult 🍋 to actually get close enough to hit him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I just cast a fire spell on him there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Round One's clear and 🍋 we're off to the next level, 🍊 which is simply slightly larger 🍋 and has more branching paths. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, while "Dragon Buster" was an innovative 🍋 and under-appreciated game, in its time, 🍊 it doesn't really hold up that well today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is [pretty] repetitive 🍊 and while the Arcade version 🍋 holds a certain appeal, 🍊 due to the nice graphics 🍋 and decent sound, 🍊 this F.C. port looks awfully plain. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There is a certain amount of 🍋 climbing and jumping in the game, 🍊 like you saw a second ago, but you 🍋 wouldn't really call this a Platformer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's mostly just 🍋 walk, walk, walk, 🍋 then fight a boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the fact that you get ma... 🍊 -- more or less the same four 🍋 bosses over and over again 🍊 does make the game a little dull, 🍋 after a while. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some levels (like, as you get later on 🍋 [in] the game) get a bit more complicated, 🍊 but, uh, still it's... -- 🍊 the game is the same sort of thing 🍋 over and over again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, unfortunately "Dragon Buster" 🍋 is a good example of {a} fine game 🍊 that became obsolete by the g... -- better 🍋 games that followed in its wake. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Ghosts 'n Goblins" came out 🍋 just a year later, 🍊 but is massively more playable 🍋 by today's standards. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Labyrinth 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 January 07 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atlas
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tokuma Shoten 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "...Episode 14" is winding down, and we 🍋 have one really big game to cover, 🍊 but first we have to do "Labyrinth", 🍋 published by Tokuma Shoten 🍊 (the monstrous Japanese publishing 🍋 and entertainment company). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As the, uh, credits scroll, here, 🍋 note the Activision copyright. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll discuss that a little later. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Labyrinth" is, of course, based on 🍊 the popular Jim Henson/George Lucas 🍋 movie, starring Jennifer Connelly 🍊 (and David Bowie as the Goblin King 🍋 who doesn't really look like a goblin). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like in the movie, 🍊 Sarah's brother has been kidnapped 🍋 and must be rescued in thirteen hours. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By the way, this game was 🍋 [only] released in Japan 🍊 and we are playing an 🍋 unofficial English translation. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, your character in this game doesn't 🍋 really resemble Jennifer Connelly, but has 🍊 rather been transformed into a 🍋 typical Japanese super-deformed girl, 🍊 who looks to still be 🍋 around grade school age. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Labyrinth" is a rather large 🍋 ambitious Action-Adventure Game, 🍊 taking place in a series of 🍋 interconnected maze-like levels 🍊 (which makes sense because the game 🍋 is about a 'labyrinth', after all) 🍊 and it sort of resembles, 🍋 well... "King Kong 2", perhaps. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I just grabbed the necklace, 🍋 which will grab me some money 🍊 and then there is the hearts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can apply the hearts to 🍋 one of your, uh, companions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Get enough hearts and they'll appear 🍋 in the game with you and assist you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character can't die, in the 🍋 normal sense, but can run out of time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can see the timer in the 🍋 upper right-hand corner there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Getting hit will cause you 🍋 to lose a few minutes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If it reaches zero, the game is over. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to collect a series of keys, 🍋 but there are other items as well, 🍊 such as books that will restore some time, 🍋 hearts that can be given to your companions, 🍊 the necklaces which are, uh, 🍋 money that can be used in shops, 🍊 and so on so forth. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The main challenge of the game is to 🍋 find your way around the various levels, 🍊 which are mostly [pretty] tricky to navigate, 🍋 however once you've mapped the game out... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Oh, I got some sort of 🍋 little scroll there 🍊 that gave me {I} guess 🍋 about an hour or so 🍋 worth of time.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've figured a way around, uh, the 🍋 game, it's actually really not that difficult. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Regardless, you do have, 🍋 sort of, a constant 🍋 stream of enemies 🍊 coming out at you, uh, and attacking, 🍋 which can get [pretty] irritating. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And I mentioned Activision 🍋 is listed in the credits, 🍊 which raises the question, 🍋 'Who developed this game?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Some game sites list 🍋 Activision as the developer, 🍊 but they were the publisher of 🍋 another "Labyrinth..." game - 🍊 the one developed by Lucasarts 🍋 for American computers, 🍊 such as the Apple II 🍋 and the Commodore 64. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Both games are based on the movie, 🍊 but they are otherwise 🍋 completely different games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I assume Tokuma Shoten had to license 🍋 the game rights from Activision. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Intriguingly, in one of the levels 🍊 the word 'Atlus' is spelled 🍋 out in the background, 🍊 wh... -- which makes ya wonder, 🍋 'Is this an early Atlus game?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They seem to specialize in 🍋 Fantasy and R.P.G. games, 🍊 so "Labyrinth" is certainly 🍋 consistent with their style. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, no matter who developed "Labyrinth", 🍊 it is a solid attempt at making 🍋 a big "...Zelda"-like Adventure Game, 🍊 but is let down by the gameplay 🍋 and lack of variety of the levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And speaking of disappointments, let's 🍋 move on to the last game this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Legend of Zelda 2: Link no Bouken 🇯🇵 // Zelda II: The Adventures of Link 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 January 14 🇯🇵 // 1988 December 01 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our last game this episode is a huge one: 🍋 "Zelda II: The Adventures of Link". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first "...Zelda" game, 🍋 released in February of 1986, 🍊 was an enormous hit in Japan 🍋 and, eleven months later, 🍊 Nintendo has put out 🍋 a sequel on the F.D.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, what we're looking at here 🍋 is actually the Western version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a [pretty] nice little intro 🍊 and we're eventually given 🍋 a title scroll, detailing the plot 🍊 (though the manual, itself, 🍋 tells a slightly different story). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Rather than Zelda, herself, 🍋 being under a sleeping spell, 🍊 it was actually some distant 🍋 ancestor (also named Zelda) 🍊 who was put under a 🍋 'Sleeping Beauty'-style curse, 🍊 many years ago. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As a result, Link has to find 🍋 the Triforce of Courage 🍊 (apparently a different Triforce 🍊 - Triforce No.3, 🍋 according to the title scroll - 🍊 than the one found in the first game) 🍋 to awaken her. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I'm] not sure what happened 🍋 to Triforce No.2. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Nintendo is known for 🍋 making some odd sequels 🍊 and "Zelda II..." is no exception. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 It's often called 🍋 the black sheep of 🍋 the '...Zelda' family. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's quite a bit different 🍋 than its predecessor 🍊 and not nearly as popular, 🍊 though of course it still 🍋 sold several million copies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The basic idea is the same: 🍋 you move around on an overworld, 🍊 enter dungeons 🍋 (or 'palaces' in this game), 🍊 defeat bosses, 🍋 and then repeat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The most obvious difference 🍋 is that all the battle sequences 🍊 are now from a more standard 🍋 side-view perspective 🍊 and scrolling is used in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, while "Zelda II..." 🍋 is not really an R.P.G., 🍊 it does borrow a number of 🍋 elements from the genre. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This shouldn't really be surprising. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Japan was becoming very 🍋 fascinated with R.P.G.s 🍊 and virtually every game genre, 🍋 from Platformers to Shoot-'em-Ups 🍊 were adding in R.P.G. elements. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 With Zelda, this means enemies 🍋 are appearing randomly on the overworld, 🍊 which, uh, (let's face it) 🍊 looks an awful lot like it was 🍋 taken straight out of "Dragon Quest". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, there are Experience Points and 🍋 Leveling Up of Attack, Defense, and Magic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's right; 🍋 Link has magic in this game, 🍊 though he won't be 🍋 using it that frequently. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a number of Platforming 🍋 elements, such as scenes like this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike the first game, 🍊 falling to your death is a 🍋 common occurrence in "Zelda II...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also taken from R.P.G.s, there are 🍋 lots of towns and N.P.C.s to talk to 🍊 (not just crazy old guys in caves). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing about "Zelda II..." is it 🍋 doesn't always play by R.P.G. rules. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some common enemies don't 🍋 drop any Experience Points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then there's this woman, 🍋 who refills your Life Bar 🍊 when you go inside 🍋 the house with her. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 This particular scene sort of makes you 🍋 wonder exactly what they were thinking of. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The N.P.C.s give you little hints 🍊 and occasionally send you on short 🍋 little quests to find some object, 🍊 such as a trophy or a lost child. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The reward? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can usually mmm... 🍋 learn a new magical spell! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, some of the spells 🍋 are generally useful, 🍊 while others have 🍋 very specific purposes 🍊 (such as defeating a particular boss). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah, for example, I'd just, 🍋 uh, found this woman's trophy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now she'll invite me in to meet 🍋 her little wizard-like grandfather. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These guys, uh, always live in 🍋 some sort of basement in the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's going to give us 🍋 the Jump spell, 🍊 which is necessary to make 🍋 some of the jumps in the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It can make you jump 🍋 a little bit higher. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 More traditionally, 🍋 some items are found, 🍊 hidden in the p... -- 🍋 palaces themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 there's a raft and a flute 🍊 and these are actually needed to 🍋 make progress into, uh, some areas. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another major change: 🍋 "Zelda II..." is much more linear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Link travels along a winding path 🍋 that moves, roughly, from east to west. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There is some backtracking required 🍊 but very little, along the way, 🍋 of puzzles or exploration. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Combat is obviously very 🍋 different in "Zelda II..." 🍊 and I think this is a 🍋 major failing in the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some enemies have 🍋 some sort of shield 🍊 and can attack 🍋 both high and low. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you are constantly ducking 🍋 and then standing up, 🍊 trying to shield their blows 🍋 and then get a hit in, yourself. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, heresh -- here's the, uh, 🍋 real meat of the game: the palaces. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike the linked rooms in "...Zelda (I)", 🍊 the palaces have these long corridors, 🍋 with floors connected by elevators. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Keys are required to get past locked doors 🍋 and there's even some hidden passages, 🍊 so you won't s... -- simply be moving 🍋 in a strictly linear fashion. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Still, the palaces feel very 🍋 different than "...Zelda"'s dungeons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Here's one of these difficult 🍋 and annoying enemies, right here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Remember the Darknuts in "...Zelda"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You had to sneak up 🍋 and hit 'em from behind. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Zelda II..." almost 🍋 every enemy is like that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can't just walk up and hit them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, [pretty] much 🍋 all the enemies take multiple hits 🍊 (often around five to ten 🍋 - sometimes a whole lot more) 🍊 even once you're all powered up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This makes combat kind of 🍋 tiresome and repetitive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I really got tired of 🍋 dealing with these guys! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Those little blue things with spikes, 🍋 I don't think you can destroy at all. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You have, um, some special attacks 🍋 that you learn throughout the game, 🍊 like a jump with a, uh, downward 🍋 sword thrust, like you saw there, 🍊 but they don't seem to actually work 🍋 on most of the tougher enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Likewise, throwing your sword 🍋 doesn't work on most enemies either, 🍊 except for the really weak ones. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, that was the raft (required 🍋 to get to the eastern continent). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Every palace will end in a boss battle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, the one spell you use the most 🍋 is probably the Shield spell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We see this coming up, right here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 These [are] almost, sort of, like, 🍋 "Castlevania"-like rooms, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 How many of the bosses in this game 🍋 are of the, sort of, 🍊 'jump and hit them on the head' 🍋 variety, just like "Castlevania"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Castlevania" seems to be, sort of, 🍋 an influence on this game, 🍊 though (oddly enough) "Castlevania II..." 🍋 seems sort of influenced by "Zelda II...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I guess it's hard to say. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, just like in "Castlevania", 🍊 you actually, sort of, get pushed 🍋 back a bit when you get hit by an enemy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this makes the Platforming 🍋 sections all the more difficult 🍊 and really, uh, a bit 🍋 irritating at times. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Remember those Gorgon heads 🍋 that you had in "Castlevania"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, there's tons of flying enemies here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 (Ah, here I'm using the raft to 🍋 get over to the eastern continent.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's, uh, some more very basic 🍋 enemies there that don't take any, uh... 🍊 don't give you any 🍋 hit... Experience Points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And these things are 🍋 much like the Gorgon heads, 🍊 [only] they take, like, 🍋 five hits to kill. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It seems that, especially 🍋 towards the end of the game, 🍊 it's very common to, uh, [scoffs] 🍋 (as you can see there) 🍊 constantly be knocked off 🍊 by enemies that suddenly fly in, 🍋 from the other side of the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think this probably [provided] 🍋 the majority of the moments 🍊 when I wanted to throw my 🍋 controller at the screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But this boss is a little bit different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to use a special Reflect spell 🍋 to bounce his spells back at h... -- him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's the [only] way you can defeat him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One cool thing about this game is, 🍋 every time you defeat a boss, 🍊 they do have a [pretty] spectacular demise, 🍋 which we'll see here in just a second. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, after finishing a boss, 🍋 you get a life and magic refill 🍊 and you also automatically Level Up one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, incidentally, when you Level Up, 🍋 you can [only] choose one attribute. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Defense (which is Life. 🍋 Here, Life's at Level 7.), 🍊 uh, Weapon (which is at 6), 🍋 and Magic (which is also at 6). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Leveling Up doesn't actually 🍋 increase your Life or Magic meter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's done by h... -- finding 🍋 Heart Containers and 🍊 the Magic Containers 🍋 hidden around the overworld. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I've put the crystal in 🍋 the little statue, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently you have to do this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 The game doesn't really 🍋 make it clear why. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then you actually select 🍋 what you wanna Level Up, here 🍊 (here, I'm going for Magic) 🍋 or you [can] hit Cancel and then 🍊 wait 'til you get more points 🍋 to Level Up something else. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, Leveling Up reduces 🍋 your points down to zero. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At one point, you find boots 🍋 that allow you to walk on water. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This gives Link an additional 🍋 messiah-like quality. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here we're going to get a Heart Container. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It should be noted there isn't 🍋 any, uh, armor or weapons 🍊 [to] be found [in] this game 🍋 (no bows or boomerangs or bombs). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [only] have your standard sword. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... Mmm... 🍊 You'll see there's 🍋 also no shops as well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's more bad news: 🍋 invisible flying enemies! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I just hit one, there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You actually need to find a... 🍊 (There! I saw him 🍋 there, for a second.) 🍊 -- need to find a cross 🍋 in order to see them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Zelda II..." is much more difficult 🍋 than its predecessor. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's certainly the most difficult 🍋 game Nintendo has released so far. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It makes, uh, "Kid Icarus..." 🍋 look like a cakewalk. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, many of the times 🍋 that you get killed, 🍊 it feels sort of unfair and cheap. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like I said, you're jumping; 🍊 suddenly an enemy flies out from 🍋 the side of the screen and hits you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The last boss seems kind of tough. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 Though the boss might be 🍋 considered a bit of a cop out; it's just Link's shadow. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He appears very fast 🍋 and difficult to hit, 🍊 but {it} turns out you can just stand 🍋 on one side and spam him to death. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Sort of 🍋 disappointing, I suppose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then we find Triforce No.3. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, in the years since 🍋 "Zelda II..." was released, um, 🍊 the game has found a lot of defenders, 🍊 [who], uh, feel it's 🍋 some sort of lost classic 🍊 and that the initial bad reaction 🍋 was simply a knee-jerk reaction to, 🍊 uh, the changes made to the formula. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, playing the game now, 🍊 I honestly say I don't 🍋 really like this game 🍊 and much of what made "...Zelda" 🍋 great has been removed 🍊 (the puzzles, 🍋 and the variety of items to find, 🍊 and weapons, the exploration, 🍋 um... all that sort of stuff) 🍊 and it's been replaced 🍋 with much weaker elements. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Zelda II..." seems like a... 🍋 sort of tedious game, 🍊 with, uh, irksome 🍋 repetitive combat 🍊 and downright hateful 🍋 Platforming sequences. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Princess Zelda seems [pretty] cheerful, 🍊 for someone who has been in a coma 🍋 for hundreds of years. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, how does she even 🍋 know who is -- Link is? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I guess "...Z..." -- the first "...Zelda" really seemed... 🍊 not really like anything else that had 🍋 been released on the FamiCom so far, 🍊 where this "Zelda II..." seems 🍋 [pretty] typical of, uh, 🍊 side-scrolling Platformers 🍋 with R.P.G. elements. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it's not really a terrible game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 It's a typical high-quality release 🍋 from Nintendo in many regards. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just that its flaws 🍋 prevent it from being a *fun* game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, as you are probably aware, 🍊 there wouldn't be another Zelda game 🍋 until 1991 (four years later). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As it turns out, that game was 🍋 slightly better received. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And so that was "Zelda II..." 🍊 - one of the most divisive games 🍋 for the entire system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Either you love it or you hate it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or, well, I guess I fell 🍋 somewhere in the middle. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 14 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ironically, next episode 🍊 we'll begin with another sequel 🍋 to a popular Japanese game 🍊 and a sequel that I feel is 🍋 much more successful than "Zelda II...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So definitely tune in next time 🍋 for "Chrontendo Episode 15"! 🍇🍌
