👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 40 ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Well, it's been a long time coming, but we've finally reached the end of <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We've caught the last few days December in terms of Japanese releases, as well as a handful of U.S. releases from Konami, Sunsoft, and Tengen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This episode features mostly junk, but brace yourself for one fantastic game from Capcom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We begin on December <TWENTY::20>. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Piccari Games 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh my god, the first game is a and already it begins - more goddamn Baseball Games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are so many damn Baseball Games on the system that the genre is becoming ripe for parody. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, later on this episode, we'll actually see such a parody. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 For the moment, please observe this is "Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88", the third game and Namco FamiCom Baseball series, which is very much beloved in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As always, you pick the team based on real life Japanese Baseball teams. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Then choose your lineup. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One new option, pick a stadium, you can choose for different venues for the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Beyond that, it's business as usual. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, I dare you to pick out "...Family Stadium '88" out of a lineup of all the other 'Family Stadium' games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One rather annoying trait of the series is you always seem to hit foul balls. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Just one after the other. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Foul, foul, foul ball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oh, this cut seems new. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Pitching is as you well a bit easier than hitting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Choose between fast and slow balls. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Slow bowls often seem to confuse the C.P.U.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 A number of online sources state this was released in the U.S. by Tengen as "R.B.I. Baseball <THREE::3>", but that's not really the case. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first "R.B.I. Baseball" Game was a conversion of the first "Family Stadium" game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But "R.B.I. Baseball <TWO::2>" and "...<THREE::3>" are Western-developed games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're actually unrelated the "...Family Stadium '87" and "...'88". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I went one last thing, filming is still quite a bit of a pain. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's still hard to tell where the ball is going to land. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the C.P.U. is good at smacking just, sort of, huge hits that land right on the middle of your outfield. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So obviously, I'm getting [pretty] tired of these. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But, on the bright side, I think this is the last 'Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium' game for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Roller Ball 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 20 🇯🇵 // 1990 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL Laboratory 🇯🇵 // HAL America 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Hey, new HAL game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Last time we saw game published by them was a couple of 'Eggerland' games back in August of <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And this one is "Roller Ball". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was released in both Japan and the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But both versions are just about identical. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, don't get too excited by the name "Roller Ball". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you're thinking this is going to be based on the movie with James Caan, and they'll be skating around killing people, then you'll be disappointed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Because "Roller Ball" is a Pinball Game, and a [pretty] basic one at that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It does have a [pretty] tall table for screens. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Based around a rather non-realistic view of Manhattan from the New York harbor. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can see the Statue of Liberty and then the Empire State Building rising up behind it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Each new ball ends up on this screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a few things to do there a little slot machine various kinds of bonuses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 With a bit of luck you can shoot up past the slot machine into the highest screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You'll see a blimp flying around-up there. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I assumed there was some sort of a hidden screen access by opening the gate, but I didn't find it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As far as Pinball Games go, this one seems okay. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nothing too exciting or special, as far as I can tell. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's actually a reworked version of a <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-FOUR::1984> Computer Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can note Satoru Iwata has name and the producer credit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I guess this must be a reference to the Yes song. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, how made quite a few improvements to the original one released to this FamiCom version. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's even a <TWO::2>-Player competitive game built in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So while "Roller Ball" isn't so bad, it just seems a little bit ordinary. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you watch "Chronturbo Episode Two" (and really you should if you haven't) then you've already seen Compile's completely awesome game "Alien Crush". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 After that game, it's kind of hard to go back to stuff like this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Kemco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 December <TWENTY-ONE::21> - we're in the homestretch here, folks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 From Kemco this is "Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu" (literally "Galaxy Hero Legend"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You know those rubber nut sacks that people put on the bumper of their trucks? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Looks like they attached to one of those two Imperial Star Destroyer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Tasteful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh wait. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So the real title is "Heldens Oregon From Kosmos Engine" or "Heroes Saga of Cosmic Island". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And in English, the anime series is called "Legend of Galactic Heroes". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Guess all amounts to about the same thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So this is like a Tactical Space Simulation Game, which actually fits nicely into the German name. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Since in Japan they like to give German themes to Military Strategy-type Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There's a [pretty] big cast of characters in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So you play as this commander of the Galactic Empire. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I believe his name is Reinhardt von Lohmann ROM. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He controls a big fleet of flying space palaces so you can see in the background there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And, oh man, that music. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's Ravel's "Bolero", and it plays constantly throughout the entire game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now I bet you're thinking this was probably based on a cartoon, which it was, but originally it was a series of Sci-Fi novels. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Then it became a manga and anime. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So one of those dramatic Space Opera epics about two rival empires locked in galactic war and blah, blah blah. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Games seems to capture the look of the cartoon with lots of guys standing around on spaceships looking all intense. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Quite frankly, it looks [pretty] boring. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Lotsa yackety yak going on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There eventually some space battles, but I think the first chunk of the game is just moving around space talking to people. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have a galaxy map and you can travel from planet to planet or send out scout ships. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sounds a lot like "Mass Effect" now that I think about it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now there are actually a bunch of games called 'Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There were several P.C. games and there was also a Super FamiCom game, which looks maybe a bit more exciting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Certainly the music is less irritating. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then later, there was a Saturn game which had fully animated cutscenes and also much better music. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there have been newer games since then, but they all seem to be, sort of, Space Flight Simulation Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, the FamiCom game seems [pretty] slow or repetitive. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe it would appeal to fans of the series. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Someone who would recognize characters and events from the T.V. show and be like, oh boy, here's the scene where count bond luthan finger meets Baron glede be guessing and asked him who his qualifier is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But for everybody else, I suspect this game will be really dull. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tetris 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Alexey Pajitnov | Bullet-Proof Software 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bullet-Proof Software 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's another game from the none to prolific Bulletproof Software, Hank Rogers' company. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you ever get into your head to get a gun and test out the name Bulletproof Software, don't bother. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm 99% sure their cartridges are not bulletproof. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh, the title screen explains where the "Tetris" blocks come from. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're pieces of masonry falling off St. Basil's Cathedral. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At last we know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is a cliche but "Tetris" is a game which needs no introduction. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is, however, the first console version of "Tetris". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And already been released commercially in the West on computers and arcades. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You can select both stages and rounds here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 To choose around other than zero, there will already be blocks in the bottom of the screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And as you also probably noticed, you have a few different music choices. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The rules are standard "Tetris", you try to fill up an entire row of blocks and then the roll disappear. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have to eliminate a set number of rows to move on. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is indicated with the lines counter up on the right side of the screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When it reaches zero, your points added up, which takes an irritatingly long time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess it's intended to give you a little break between levels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now there's nothing really wrong with Bulletproof Software's version of "Tetris", but probably not going to be your favorite version of "Tetris" either. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I will point out this is not the same game released by Nintendo in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, the well-known Game Boy version was also designed by bulletproof. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I think probably the main hang up you'll encounter is that the controls are different than in most versions. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You press down on the D-Pad to rotate the blocks and use the button to instantly drop down the blocks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later versions like the Game Boy "Tetris", reverse this, so you afford to have to kind of retrain your reflexes while you're playing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's also [pretty] slow compared to most other versions, and it's single player [only]. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And of course, there is a huge and dramatic story behind "Tetris" and the rights of the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That involves Hank Rogers, Nintendo, Tengen, the Soviet authorities, and others. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 'Chrontendo' will go into that story in detail once we reach the tentative release of "Tetris". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tarot Uranai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Scorpion Soft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Scorpion Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We have exactly one F.D.S. game today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oh Lord, why that horrible high pitched noise. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then a second later we get this dreary, almost punitive sounding musical theme. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is "Tarot", sometimes called "Tarot Uranai" from Scorpion Soft, one of the least prolific video game publishers will encounter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, this is their second and last game for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The other was "Michael English they Bokan" from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987> in which a cartoon cat teaches you English. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Terror and is yet another fortune telling game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, you've seen these before in "Chrontendo ... <THIRTY-EIGHT::38>" and "...<THIRTY-NINE::39>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess; they were briefly popular in late <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This one is based around the Tarot deck. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You have three different categories which you can look into love, business, and study. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Then you choose the pattern that the cars are set down into a heart, V shape, or a cross. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 He then get this pointless but, sort of, thing part where you scatter the cards. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One button moves the cards around randomly, as the two are pushing around on the table, and the other collects them back into a pile. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is probably the neatest part of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And then get to choose which cards you want to use, and they're placed on the heart shape or shape you chose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You will then get to reveal the cards. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Each time a card slipped over there is a long loading pause. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Give them see the card and to get an explanation as to what it means. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Since the game is so boring, I thought I'd explain what exactly Tarot is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's an old card game, probably Italian in origin. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Tarot deck is related to our standard <FIFTY-TWO::52> card deck, except that it has different face cards. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Italian Tarot decks normally have suit of wands, swords, cups and coins whereas French Tarot used clubs, spades, diamonds, and hearts. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The face card are based on, sort of, standard archetypes the king, the pope, for mountebank for us as well as natural or biblical concepts such as the Sun, Moon, judgment day, or the Tower of Babel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game of Tarot in its variations are still commonly played in Europe. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But a new use emerged in the <EIGHTEEN-HUNDREDS::1800s> when a mystic named elephants Levi popularized the concept of the Tarot deck as having a cold meanings. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Tarot is a form of divination became well-known in the U.K. in the U.S. in the early <TWO::2>0th century with the publication of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck, which gave the Tarot deck a more accolti, sort of, makeover, changing the postcard to the Hierophant, for example. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Most modern Tarot decks, and the cards here are, sort of, inspired by the imagery of the Rider-Waite deck. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As a result in the U.S., we commonly think of Tarot as a fortune telling device rather than a card game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Apparently the same is true in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So that's three Fortune-Telling Games in December '88. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If nothing else, it proves that Rare's "Taboo: The Sixth Sense" has some sort of tradition behind it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Moero!! Pro Soccer 🇯🇵 // Goal! 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 23 🇯🇵 // <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here we have the first of two toes to develop games today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I know to Tose games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 How lucky can you get? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's the latest Angelica 'Moero!!' sport series, 'Moero!! Pro Soccer'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Do all the Marvel games show a ball bouncing off the exclamation points the logo was such force that actually deforms the ball? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As far as I know, yes, they all do. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I wonder if those are real Soccer League emblems. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You wouldn't think that the U.S. would need yet another Soccer Game, but this was released in the U.S. as "Goal". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's funny, quite a few of the 'Moero!!' games got U.S. releases. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There was "Bases Loaded", "Hoops", this game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The one that didn't get us release was "Moero!! Judo". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You have the typical gameplay options. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Then you choose a con. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm [pretty] sure all the countries are exactly the same. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There doesn't appear to be any individual stats. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There aren't even individual players just a bunch of identical guys and uniforms. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Some Soccer Games orient the fields vertically, others left to right. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Moero!! Pro Soccer" does it around a <FORTY-FIVE-DEGREE::45> angle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now take a look at your players there. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The fellow with a little one below him is the guy that you're currently controlling. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It controls much like the other Soccer Games we've seen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The automatically dribble the ball while moving around. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One button kicks, the other passes, you need to use the D-Pad, sort of, pointing the direction wire passing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It doesn't automatically kick towards one of your teammates so you can get some wild passes if not careful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 When you make a goal, this guy gets really excited and runs around screaming and I guess the crowd is going wild. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Of course, some of the typical issues occur. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When you're not in possession of the ball the game will automatically switch control to the teammate nearest the ball or at least it's mostly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It does seem to, sort of, switch around haphazardly at times. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this can cause frustration when you're running around trying to get control from the other team. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Compared to some other Soccer Games, the cameras zoomed out quite a bit, giving you a [pretty] good view of the field. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Still, there will definitely be times when none of your players are visible on screen and you're wondering where they are. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game is really nothing special visually. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some of the graphics and the cutscenes are [pretty] ugly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sound effects are a bit annoying, but you know, I've played worse Soccer Games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So really, "Moero!! Pro Soccer" isn't really half bad. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Skate or Die! 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by E.A. | Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Ultra 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, we've got a few more U.S. games from December <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> starting with "Skate or Die!", the curious collaboration between Electronic Arts and Konami. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This was the first E.A. title to reach the N.E.S., I believe. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Look at this rad skater such attitude. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If nothing else, "Skate or Die!" has [pretty] good music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So rather than your typical boring menu page, you begin the skate shop owned by Rodney recluse who is apparently intended to resemble a Punk Rock Rodney Dangerfield. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you're too young to remember who Rodney Dangerfield is, don't worry about it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He was an old-school comedian who had a strange career revival in the <NINETEEN-EIGHTIES::1980s>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As you move around the cursor (which you'll see is shaped like the words and Skate or Die) Rodney will say various amusing or informative things. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 My favorite little bit here is that he appears to be an ex marine. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And before you can compete you need to sign in. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This makes sense, but after typing in your name, you have to save and exit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well to do this, you hit cancel. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yes, cancel replaces what will normally be called done, save, okay, or accept in other video games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's right cancel; that makes absolutely no sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Out on the street you need to skate around and then choose the event that you want. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Skate or Die!" was originally an E.A. Computer Game from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here's the Commodore <SIXTY-FOUR::64> version which had even more rocking music. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game was quite successful, which somehow led to the deal was reported to the N.E.S. under their Ultra label. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One thing missing from the N.E.S. game is that you could choose your own skateboard color and Computer Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So Skinner was [pretty] much ease entry into the world of console gaming for better or worse. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As we can see, the N.E.S. version looks almost identical to the original. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So all told, there are five events, Joust, Race Jam, High Jump, and Freestyle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Freestyle or ramp is like a more exciting version of that figure skating from "Winter Games". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Escape by repeatedly pressing the A button to build up speed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When you reach the top of the ramp, you do some a D-Pad and button moves to form a trick. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Then you go down just keep going performing tricks to try to rack up a high score. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 No, I didn't quite get the hang of it and kept falling down. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So yeah, I'm definitely having "Winter Games" flashbacks here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So far, so good. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some graphics are reused in the next event, the high jump. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So here's what we start coming from problems, just like freestyle, you begin by pressing the A button. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But do you build up speed by rapidly pressing the A button? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nope, you build up speed by rapidly pressing the B button. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So we have two similar events with similar controls except for some reason a function has been switched from the A button to B button. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 What's also weird is that you have to hit the A button or in the air in order to lock in your attempt. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you don't, the game won't count the best attempt is your final score, but rather it'll count the last attempt instead. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Jam and Race are two events that use a dual control schema, regular foot and goofy foot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Goofy foot is actually where you put your right foot at the front of the board. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Below the sprite, you're exactly the same regardless which one you choose? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In regular, the control pad theoretically causes your scanner to go in the same direction that you press on the D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, it does do some kind of strange stuff. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like let's say the skater is pointing to the right, and you want to turn him <NINETY-DEGREES::90°> clockwise. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Do press down? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nope. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe left? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nope, you press right. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now with a goofy foot, the controls are somewhat inverted. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The directional buttons are used relative to the direction that your skater is facing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So if you are facing down you press the left to turn right and vice versa. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And as our example above, if you are facing right and you want to turn <NINETY-DEGREES::90°> clockwise, you press right which is the same as regular foot, which doesn't make any sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also to speed up and loopy foot you press up on the D-Pad and down to slow down. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Regular this is reversed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But then you also have these crazy controls for hitting or kicking. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You press the A button while pressing the D-Pad the direction you are facing and that will hit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 To kick if you press a while pressing the D-Pad in the opposite direction you're facing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 To jump, you press a white holding up and to duck you press a white holding now. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I think that these controls are the same for goofy and regular foot, but by now I'm so confused I can't remember. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So who was the guy who designed this level and why was he not aware that the N.E.S. had two buttons? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why map punch, kick, jump, and duck all to the same button? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The B button is not used at all! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And in race if you fall down into the A button to get back up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Button jam this happens automatically. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sure all this sounds like fun but damn guys, why did you have to make the controls so unintuitive. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And why does your character change appearance in every single event? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In jam you have this crazy spiky hair and then the downhill race you have like regular short hair. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so the last event is the pool event, Joust. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once again your character sprite is totally different. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The object is to just hit the other guy with your 'American Gladiator' to help or. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's [pretty] straightforward, though control the or automatically switches between each person every five seconds. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now I'm not saying that "Skate or Die!" isn't or cannot be a fun game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The main appeal is probably the <TWO::2>-Player mode. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then it's more often just used for screwing around and trying to knock each other down. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the game would be much much better if the controls were implemented better or at least in a way that makes sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now "Skate or Die!" is clearly inspired by the Atari Arcade Game "<SEVEN-HUNDRED-TWENTY-DEGREES::720°>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, the phrase "Skate or Die!" is taken directly out of that game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "<SEVEN-HUNDRED-TWENTY-DEGREES::720°>" <THREE-HUNDRED-SIXTY-DEGREE::360°> joysticks set up that worked much better than the D-Pad. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In fact, to me "Skate or Die!" seems, sort of, like an unnecessary hybrid between "<SEVEN-HUNDRED-TWENTY-DEGREES::720°>" and the Epyx Sports Games, and really is one of those frustrating games I've seen in a while. 🍇🍌

👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Next up we have to U.S. games from Sunsoft starting with "Platoon". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Really a game based on "Platoon". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess that sort of makes sense. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Platoon" was technically in any war movie, though really nothing like the kind of movies that normally get made into games like "Rambo" or "Predator". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 How many other movies won the Oscar for Best Picture and got a video game adaptation, I wonder? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "The Godfather" I guess and "Lord of the Rings" is often made in video games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, "Platoon" was the <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SIX::1986> movie that catapulted Oliver Stone to fame inspired by his own experiences Vietnam. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If any of you younger folk out there [only] know Charlie Sheen as a washed up porn star banging coke head walking punch line, then be aware that he was briefly considered to have a lot of promise as a young actor in "Platoon" "Wall Street" before moving on to Orson Welles movies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In "Platoon" you play as the sheen character of Chris Taylor, at least in theory. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well, what just happened there? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Huh? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 How is that fair? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, kids, I guess "Platoon" is not fair. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So the game slightly resembles some scenes from the movie sort of. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's divided into four levels, each completely different than all the others. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the first you're trying to find some explosives and a jungle and blow up a bridge. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The problem is the explosives and bridge are somewhere in a huge maze-like jungle that gives you no clues as to where they are. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And every screen looks exactly the same. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So you just wander around and around and around and open you somehow stumble onto the explosives. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If the layout of "Rambo" drove you crazy, then prepare be driven absolutely nuts by "Platoon". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Vietcong are constantly walking around and randomly shooting you prudently jumping out and actually landing on you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game seems to love knocking you down and just so you're getting up from the ground having another guy jump and land on you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And you see those almost invisible brown tripwires along the ground. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Setting one of those off will cost you one life. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So move very carefully and constantly check the ground for tripwires. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now this seems terrible you should check the Computer versions. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oh lord. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is this really the music. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Platoon" started off as a Computer Game from Ocean Software a British developer who are mostly known for cranking out crappy licensed games in the <EIGHTIES::'80s>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They ended up being absorbed by Infogrames and eventually Atari U.K.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is the terrible DOS version. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Naturally it got rave reviews from the gaming press when it came out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now I assume that almost anyone trying to play "Platoon" nowadays would probably give up before finding the bridge. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But if you do somehow managed to find it you'll blow it up which knocks you down doesn't cause any damage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You next need to find the entrance to the next level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game doesn't tell you this., of course. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe do the manual does. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Gaming, sort of, like in the vein of "Indiana Jones and Temple of Doom" or "Skate or Die!"? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nothing is really explained in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have to read the manual to figure out what to do. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Naturally, the huts are booby trapped, which, of course, will cost you one life if you happen to accidentally come across a booby trap. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You didn't need to find a map, a torch torch so much for localization. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And of course, the entrance to the tunnels. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game wardens who get shooting villagers, but it doesn't really matter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 My Lord. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why is that text so fast? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now if you're hoping the game gets better at this point, then you are totally naive afraid. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The second level is the tunnel system and is really, really annoying. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The developers for some reason could [only] conceive of a sewer system for tunnel level, so you are knee deep in water despite the fact that a village in the jungle consisting of eight huts with no visible plumbing would not have a gigantic underground sewer system straight out of the third man. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You want your crosshair to swing from side to side. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm not doing that it actually happens automatically as you walk. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But why. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It makes it much harder to shoot the guys when they pop out of the water. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh, you can see the arrow in the lower left corner. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's how many bullets you have good luck. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Level <Three::3> is short and boring. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And you simply move around the crosshairs and shoot the shadowy shapes that appear. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's really easy, and you actually have more than enough ammo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 For some reason, the way the amount of ammo that you have and the way the lights work actually changes each level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first level we have five lives and if you die, you start off in the same place and Level <Two::2> through <Four::4>, you have two lives, and you start low from the beginning if you happen to die. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The fourth and final level is just a very repetitive series of screens where you shoot soldiers that run out across the top of the screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There are bullets flying out from the bushes at the bottom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But if you position yourself at the very bottom of the screen, those bullets will pass right through you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also, if you get to the top of the screen, the soldiers cannot hurt you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Did I mention that this game makes no goddamn since? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And to make matters weirder, the game ends with the final boss being Tom Berenger his character Sergeant Barnes, at least according to the manual. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, the film does end with Taylor killing Barnes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It doesn't somehow seem right than a Nintendo game is, sort of, struggling kids to frag their superior officers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If you beat the game, you're rewarded with this cutscene featuring the [only] known <EIGHT::8>-bit rendition of Charlie Sheen and existence. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oh, and if you're wondering about other video game renditions of Tom Berenger, well Gray Fox and "Metal Gear II..." was based on him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The bottom line is "Platoon" is ultimately too hard, too easy; it's also frustrating, pointless, repetitive and fair. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, it commits just about every video game sin imaginable. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In other words, it sucks big time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Xenophobe 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bally Midway | Sunsoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So if you thought "Platoon" was just too compelling and exciting, then I have a game for you "Xenophobe" folks are second to us at Sunsoft game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 See the chick holding the laser rifle? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 She does not appear anywhere in this game at all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And hear the music. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I hope you get your fill of that tune because you're not going to hear any more music in this game for quite some time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, so a giant spaceship sends you to a tiny little planet. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there you are. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Man, you were wearing some hipster pants. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Damn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So you shoot aliens with your little gun thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Each one takes a bunch of hits to kill. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can eventually find better weapons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sometimes aliens will drop things. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh, look gasoline can. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Do they really use gasoline and space. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, I assume everything will be powered by fusion generators or something futuristic like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Xenophobe" first appeared as a Bally Midway Arcade Game in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987> notable for the fact that three people can play at once each with their own horizontal sliver of screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also known as the gamer space crabs attach themselves to a crotch. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Sunsoft ns port drops number of players from three to two, which makes sense due to the N.E.S. has lower resolution. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Even so decent chunks of the screen are taken up by useless gray bars. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Each level is made up of a handful of rooms connected by automatic doors a gent. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Whole series of room loops around an endless circle so you can never really go anywhere. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later levels have multiple floors connected by elevators, but really there's not much to see or do in any of the rooms. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're all the same basically. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Likewise, aliens drop various objects but other than the occasional weapon or health refill the items don't really seem to do anything. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They are points [only]. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So after wandering around, shooting aliens for five minutes the screen will start flashing and we teleported back to your ship. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game notes the number of aliens that you killed as well as the items that you picked up our valuable hardware as the game calls it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You didn't get points and then you're on Level <TWO::2>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Which leads me to explain "Xenophobe"s, big problem. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's no point whatsoever in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You play it just by staying on a level for five minutes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There is no object or goal whatsoever beyond getting points and not die. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are no bosses, no special rooms to reach no hostages to save no objective. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can technically win the game without ever killing a single alien or collecting the item or actually doing anything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Arcade Game was a bit more fun. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There were a lot of aliens on the screen at all times, you can get easily overwhelmed and the three player club made sense as you blasted away from tons of aliens. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here there are [only] around two enemies on the screen at once. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you kill one another will materialize at some point random place on screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not really that hard to avoid them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So to compensate for the lack of masses of aliens, each one not [only] takes one hit, but many many hits to kill. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Even the <TWO::2>-Player version is, sort of, messed up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can't play as different characters; the game will always use the same character for both players. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But why? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Really, "Xenophobe" is, sort of, amazing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I can't recall the last time I saw a game this pointless. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It is to walk through a bunch of identical room shooting aliens for no reason. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Add in the crummy graphics, the almost total lack of music, and you've got a staggeringly enjoyable game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Vindicators 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atari Games | Tengen 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tengen 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, we've got two games from Tengen here with unknown release dates. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This will close out the U.S. releases for <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Actually, sort of, like the theme music here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so there are three zones or difficulty levels as you or I would call them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One is tingling get everything weird names. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like referring to the stages in "Indiana Jones..." as waves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You start by spinning your stars on your stats. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Short range is always a good idea. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can also stock up on fuel shields or bombs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So "Vindicators" is a vaguely R.P.G.-ish. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If this were a Japanese game, I'd call it a vertical Run-'n'-Gun. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You control a tank, a diff shoot than any tanks and turrets. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Don't touch those red things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Can't tell by looking at them, but they're some sort of landmine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But the little green men are good. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game calls them stars for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're basically the games currency. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Vindicators" first saw the light of day as an Arcade Game from early in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We just saw it in the "<NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> Arcade Round-Up" a few episodes ago. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The technical highlight of the game was the digitized graphics using things like explosions. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Atari Games was, sort of, heading down a path that will lead to the likes of pit fighter a few years from now, not necessarily a good idea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's also notable for its dual joystick tank controls, and the fact that it's very, very easy to run out of fuel very quickly and get a Game Over. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The N.E.S. version has obviously considerably downgrade of the graphics but otherwise very similar to the original. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The object is to make it from the bottom of level to the top, all the while picking up stars as well shields bombs and most importantly fuel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You see your fuel is constantly depleting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Run out of fuel and you will die. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Just as important as fuel our keys. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sometimes there's lying around; other times you need to kill an enemy to get one. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But without the keys the doors at the end of each level not open. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So after completing a level you'll want to spend the stars that you collected, maybe on some upgrades, maybe get some more fuel. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Definitely don't want to start a level with not enough fuel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And why is the game's currency in the form of stars anyway? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess that's something [only] Atari knows. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Vindicators" is a bit slower and more methodical than similar games such as "Jackal". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The reliance on fuel is a bit of a pain. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sometimes you just don't find much fuel. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Makes dying a bit ar.b.i.trary. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We've run out of fuel capsules this level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess I'll die in a few seconds. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Looking for fuel fuel no nothing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nothing here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 No oh well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Bombs are sometimes necessary to blow open doors. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though this little bonus level temps you have many items all the while counting down until the room explodes and you die. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What a horrible little trick. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 All in all, "Vindicators" is better than some of the other <ten::10> gun games we've been seeing recently. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Certainly it's more fun than "Paperboy" and it's not the main screw up the "Indiana Jones..." was. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 With tank controls are a little weird bosses are a major pain and it's [pretty] repetitive. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Not to mention that like almost every other U.S.-[only] release it was a game also released for virtually every other platform in existence. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it's nothing new or special. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It even came out for the damn Z.X. Spectrum. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, Tengen's "Vindicators" is nothing very exciting. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Sprint 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1991 August 03 🇯🇵 // <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atari Games | Tengen 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Altron 🇯🇵 // Tengen 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One more Tengen game, "Super Sprint". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like most hunger games, it's not quite clear when this was really released. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some sources think <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>; some say <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's copyrighted <EIGHTY-NINE::'89> but my notes say late <NINETEEN-EIGHTIES::1980s> so here it is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If anyone out there listening has a sense of personal identity built around the idea of "Super Sprint" being released in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> then you have my apologies for offending you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I'm sure I don't need to explain this, but "Super Sprint" is a Racing Game of the top-down variety. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's got little teeny tiny toy like cars. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We've seen several top-down Racing Games on FamiCom like Nintendo's "Grand Prix", and of course, there was Rare's "RFC program". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But this one is old-school, no fancy scrolling or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nope, it's a single-screen deal all the way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It almost seems deliberately retro. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Super Sprint" actually has a bit of history behind it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was first released in arcades in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SIX::1986>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Arcade Game had high resolution graphics and a few nice touches like the helicopter fly is down every crash. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If this does seem a little archaic compared to other contemporary Arcade Games, like "OutRun" or something like that the reason is actually a graphically upton version of an old Atari game called "Sprint" from '78 which is actually an up innovate <NINETEEN-SEVENTY-FOUR::1974> Atari Arcade Game called "Grand Track <TEN::10>", which was the first Arcade Game to use ROM and the hardware. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So here's the thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I've disliked some racing type games due to them having very digital type controls, you know, we're the [only] face like eight distinct directions or so. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The cycling section last episodes, triathlon was a good example of this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Super sprint has super finely adjusted controls. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your car can turn very smoothly, but it feels like the track is covered in Vaseline or something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You slip and slide all over the place. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If you're moving very fast at all, your car will just turn around and plow right into a wall. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the physics are completely unrealistic. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The cars feel super light, they have no weight whatsoever. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It feels more like you're racing Matchbox cars than real vehicles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Picking up wrenches in the roadway light upgrade between races. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Super traction seems like your best bet. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Speed and acceleration is just begging for trouble. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And increase score. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can actually buy a higher score. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's weird. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And here's the screen when you win a race. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One of those green things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The artist went through all the trouble like adding in those three green blocks, but why? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What are they supposed to represent? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 A lot of decisions made intended games seems, sort of, inexplicable. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like why was the helicopter limited? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You still crash but there's no helicopter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They didn't have enough spare room on the cart at a helicopter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, this is actually a [pretty] small game as it is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's like it was like, you know, stretching the limits of car technology at the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Just like "Paperboy", it eventually got a Japanese released by Ultron. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Much like "Skate or Die!" to player is definitely the way to go. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At least it gives "Super Sprint" some entertainment value; otherwise it's not very entertaining. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Akira 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh no, the world just got blowed up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Just in time for Christmas Eve <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> its "Akira", published by Taito and developed by Tose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Despite toeses involvement some of the artists [pretty] slick looking. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The way things think all the illustrations were [pretty] much copied directly from the images in the comic book or the movie, which must have helped since Tose was never known for having [pretty] artwork in its games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So it turns out had a game out on both the <TWO::2>3rd and the <TWO::2>4th of December. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They just keep pumping them out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This was released to tie-in with the pure animated movie, which was released earlier that year. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 A lot of people seem to really like that movie. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the mid to late <EIGHTIES::'80s> there was a whole lot of interest in Japanese comics and anime, and the movie actually got [pretty] hyped for the theatrical release in '88 or '89. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I remember seeing it back in the theater then. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And remember think it was kind of stupid and overrated, but what do I know? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, as we can see here the games cutscenes very closely emulate the movie. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The plot revolves around psychically kids naturally, as well as a secret military conspiracy and teenage biker gangs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess in the future style will evolve to the point where high ranking army bigwigs sport many mohawks and violent street gangs were no moldable haircuts. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Find the way cure is, sort of, a [pretty] much standard Japanese Adventure Game, though one with probably even less interactivity than most. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The commands are as expected, look, talk, interact, listen, and, of course, others appear when necessary. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As far as I can recall, this recreates the events of the movie [pretty] closely, which is probably something of a liability. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I think the point is simply to follow the storyline of the movie. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There don't seem to be any hope have any sort. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there are long stretches of dialog with no interactivity at all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game looks [pretty] decent and it has some wacky music at certain spots. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it seems, sort of, halfway between a typical Japanese Adventure Game and a Visual Novel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You can however die if you do something wrong. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you choose hit instead of duck here when dealing with this guy, he will get knocked out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the game gives you an option to restart one screen before the place where he got killed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A little bit later, I did something stupid and was arrested and ended up in jail. 🍇🍌



🤖🍊🍓 I'd say that a cara was definitely aimed at fans of the movie, rather than in gaming. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess it's not terrible, but it's hardly in a grossing game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Airwolf 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Shimada Kikaku 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kyugo Boueki 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Wow, at last, Ernest Borgnine in an <EIGHT::8>-bit form. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Hey, do you guys know that Ernest Borgnine was still alive? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I was surprised to find that out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Airwolf" is published by Kyugo Boueki a [pretty] damn obscure company who didn't produce very many other games, as far as I know. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In "Airwolf", you control the titular helicopter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The control panel looks really confusing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Luckily, this isn't a flight simulator, it's a Horizontal Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 First thing to do is pick your weapons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have a few options for the air-to-air weapon as well as the so-called surface weapon which actually can be used to hit other flying enemies for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The cannons probably the best option. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If you're not familiar with "Airwolf" well, it was a television series from the mid-'80s about a dude in a high-tech military helicopter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was created by Don Belisario who created all sorts of very popular T.V. shows back then, "Magnum P.I.", "Quantum Leap", and nowadays N.C.I.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This "Airwolf" game is not the same game released in the U.S. by Acclaim which really was a bit of a Flight Simulation Game and is not considered to be very good. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, as it turns out, this game is not very hot either. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] basic Shooter with a few issues. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The background could be a bit busy and can camouflage the activity in the foreground at times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There is also quite a bit of slowdown when too many enemies and projectiles come on the screen at once. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, the constant slowing down and then speeding up again gets [pretty] irritating. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Airwolf", is in fact, a part of the <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987> Arcade Game from Kyugo Boueki. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Arcade Game is just as obscure as the FamiCom version, but definitely has a cleaner looking screen and makes much better use of the surface weapons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's actually lots of stuff on the ground you can blow up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now at the end of each level, you will encounter a boss but here's the weird thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For the boss battles the viewpoints which is like a first-person view and you control the white crosshair, which you use to shoot out the various guns and cannons on the battleship. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You also need to shoot down the very slow moving missiles that are headed towards you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I should point out that the control of the crosshair is very sluggish and has some sort of like momentum built into it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it actually does take a second to like stop and change directions. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This makes shooting the missiles much harder than it would be otherwise. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Beyond that, there's really not a whole lot to say about "Airwolf". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are no weapons, power-ups or anything. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You will occasionally select these power icons, but surprisingly, they [only] give you points instead of power-ups. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I love the way that on this level, you get attacked by satellite dishes and radio antennas. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The most interesting thing about the design of "Airwolf" is that enemies can come at you from all angles - front behind. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It will often pass over you and then loop around and attack you from below. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's a bit different than most Shooters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Other than that, it's still [pretty] much a [pretty] generic Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not the worst we've seen but [pretty] unimpressive compared to the stuff from Konami or Compile. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shoukoushi Ceddie 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Graphic Research 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Fuji Television 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Know of all the things out there that could possibly be adapted video games, I never thought I'd be seen game based on "Little Lord Fauntleroy", but here it is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Shoukoushi Ceddie" (or "Little Prince Ceddie"). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This one character portraits actually not bad, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Mostly though the game is [pretty] damned ugly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Was published by Fuji Television, who, as you might recall, were the original publishers of Nintendo's "Doki Doki Panic" (a.k.a. "Super Mario Bros. <TWO::2>" in the U.S.). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As I mentioned, the original source control for this game was Francis Hodgson Burnett <EIGHTEEN-NINETY-SIX::1896> children's novel "Little Lord Fauntleroy". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's about a kid from New York who turns out to be next in line for a British earldom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 To classic fish out of water story with good old-fashioned American and can do meeting Hyde bound British traditionalism. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He was made into countless movies and in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>, an animated version in fujis long-running world Masterpiece Theater t series, which was produced by Nippon animation came out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The name "Shoukoushi Ceddie" was used for this version of Ceddie being envoys actual nickname short for Cedric. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sadly, well, the cartoon was very nice looking this game is not. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I appear to be fenced in by invisible walls. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Need to exit through the doors. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 An action menu appears and at this point, you might figure out that "Shoukoushi Ceddie" isn't Adventure Game, though not quite a traditional one, especially since it has these top-down, quote unquote action sequences. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You move from area to area and we'll encounter various people and talk to them much like any other "Portopia..."-style game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first part takes place in their old castle or so it seems. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can leave the castle but due to some bad programming, I got instantly hit by another character the split second I entered the next screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This causes this guy to appear who chives you and ask you some questions they have to answer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However once I exited this screen and repair on the main screen, I'm still touching the other character causing the same guy to pop up again, ad infinitum. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, so I tried it again and managed to get actually on to the regular overworld that bumping into someone. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is like the quasi-Action sequence here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You need to jump over other people on the road. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's much easier said than done. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The controls are quite terrible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 When we finally reached the next location, it looks much like the castle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 All the locations actually look kind of similar. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Note that you can talk to animals and one of your menu options is flute, which plays the flute. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This actually is important later. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, by the way, a dragon then appears later in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 None of this makes much sense to me. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Said he was built by a company called graphic research another for hire developer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I tried to find something interesting and their game credits. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But other than a 'Speed Racer' game for the PlayStation they didn't produce anything anyone's ever heard of. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Shoukoushi Ceddie" ends up being a rather unusual Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Speaking of which, check out our next game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken! 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, we've got one last game to take a look at before we get on to this episode big game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Capcom released two games on Christmas Eve, the first of which we'll examine is "Pro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken!". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yep, after tons of Pro Yakyuu games and tech fusion games, Capcom combine the two into this in a pro Baseball-themed Murder Mystery Adventure Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So the story concerns a former pro Baseball player who gets embroiled in a murder case in which the killers were dressed as ballplayers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He ended up going on the lam and trying to track down the real killers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Rather than the first-person viewpoint found in so many pore topia type games pro yaku uses the top-down mode. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Unlike a lot of these games, the game looks really good with detailed graphics and, sort of, well defined looking characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 What, sort of, weird is that the protagonist appeared to be based on a real ballplayer, he got us a guru. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He had his own Baseball Game for the Mega Drive a few years down the road. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So Capcom wasn't satisfied with making a typical Japanese Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So the added in various additional elements. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are many games down throughout and if you ever run in with the police, you'll get into this silly, sort of, top-down Vertical Shooter sequence. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As you may have notice you have Hit Points as seen in the upper left corner. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If this drops to zero, you'll die, but you'll be resurrected at a safe point. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Hit Points or L.P. (Life Points as the game called them) gradually decrease just as you walk around. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So Capcom went above and beyond the quality of most games like this, and they actually got [pretty] creative it seems. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Despite a shaky start, Capcom is rapidly becoming one of the best publishers for the FamiCom in the U.S., as demonstrated more clearly by our next game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Rockman <TWO::2> 🇯🇵 // Mega Man <TWO::2> 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "3030" ♪ by Deltron 3030

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 24 🇯🇵 // <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Mega Man <TWO::2>" begins with one of the greatest title sequences ever. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's so simple, no lengthy dialogues or something cutscenes yet it's number one highly effective. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And there we go. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Notice the two difficulties. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Holy s--- there's a password system now. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Thank you Capcom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Mega Man <TWO::2>" stars that exact like "Mega Man (1)". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You choose a robot mastered off to that level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We'll begin with the obliquely named Flash Man. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So the one thing that was added to the U.S. version was the easy version called normal. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For the sake of getting this video done in a timely fashion and we are going to go in normal. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Of course, even at the higher difficulty "Mega Man <TWO::2>" is easier in the first game for a variety of reasons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's also longer so the password feature is actually a [pretty] good idea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Since we have no special weapon, yet we'll find various inaccessible areas. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, about little wall there can be destroyed using the crash bombs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We'd already defeated crash man, we built the grab that. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I think Flash Man stage is, sort of, one of the traditional first stages, people playing "Mega Man <TWO::2>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Doesn't have anything wildly difficult in it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh, and you may attend and got an energy tank. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Unlike "Mega Man (1)" you can store energy tanks for later use the server's help refills. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Just like the first "Mega Man" game "Mega Man <TWO::2>" mixes up horizontal and vertical sections, lots of jumping climbing ladders, falling down vertical shafts. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some little picture elements are almost a Puzzle-like, as we'll see later. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At the individual level, you'll enter a room and fight a robot master. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Flash Man has the power to stop time but it's mostly a wuss, and can be defeated with the standard mega blaster [pretty] easily. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 After defeating the robot master you obtain his weapon; in this case you get one of the three special items from Dr. Light. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They are equipped just like the robot mastered weapons that are used more for transportation purposes as we'll see later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Mega Man <TWO::2>" very much retains the originals 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' philosophy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Certain weapons will be very effective against particular Robot Masters. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Additionally the special items a doctor like gives you make certain levels easier. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Everyone has their own preferred order clear the stages in. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For some reason I did err man's level second which many people prefer doing after would man so you can use the link shield. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 All assume that most people out there with a song "Air Man God toasts and". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I became a huge online hit a few years back. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Pulled out big extreme frustration the Air Man brings. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 On regular difficulties not that tough, assuming that you have enough health to withstand getting hit by the tornadoes a couple times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Capcom's first "Mega Man" game features an exceptional amount of variety and creativity in the level design. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was very unusual for its time in late <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But "Mega Man <TWO::2>" completely out does its predecessor. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Level Man's level takes you underwater, and you even get a giant mini-Boss like fish. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And, of course, "Mega Man" would not be complete without tons of spiky objects they'll instantly kill you if you touch them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's kind of weird that "Mega Man" can be pummeled by lasers fire run over by a giant tank and so on and survive yet even slightly touching a sharp surface will cause him to explode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Quick Man's level gets [pretty] nuts and places. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Speed is the theme here and giant lasers start shooting at you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Again, these are one hit kills. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You're running [only] like a fraction of a second head these things, meaning you'll have to memorize the quickest path to take. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this will often require pressing the D-Pad left to right as you exit the screen from the bottom until you're facing the right direction when you land on the next screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You'll probably lose a few lives the first time you encounter this level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This part is also cool. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Levels pitch black and [only] occasionally lit by these enemies with the flaming heads. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Quick Man is a good example of a robot master weak to a particular weapon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Flash Man's time stopper will shave off half his Life Bar and then you can finish them off much easier. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the 'Mega Man' fan community there is much discussion as to which are the best robot masters from the series based on I suppose they're a character design these forms little weapons and how cool their names are. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Metal man is one of the favorites and his metal blade is a [pretty] awesome piece of weaponry, deadly and uses up very little energy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The one thing that's interesting is the technology behind a robot that shoots metal blades or when or bombs or something is quite believable. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But what about Flash Man. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Dr. Wily and mid wave actually stopping time? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Aside from being a major scientific discovery, that would be an incredible weapon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why didn't he install a time stopping device onto every single robot or his own ship? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Dr. Wily appears to be brilliant, but also, sort of, an idiot at the same time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, so what other kind of cool things are in this game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, how about giant fire-breathing prototypes for rush who would actually they do a big amount three. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This level belongs to woodsman and I guess it's kind of weird. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It seems, sort of, animal themed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess it's your design level based around a guy called wood man that's a fire man. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A fire man level [pretty] much crates itself - it's a lava so forth. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And wood man is not exactly everybody's favorite robot master. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why the hell would you build a robot with a wooden shell. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then he shoots leads at you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Of course, he's actually a bit of a pain if you're on the crash bombs, which I don't. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That means he's completely invulnerable to your attacks while he has a leaf shield surrounding him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 His weapon however, does come in handy in spots, like crash man's level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can jump around trying to shoot these guides without falling off a little bit platform or you can just turn on the leaf shield and chill. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As for crash man himself, is almost comically susceptible to Air Man's weapon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When you defeat him, you get the crash bombs, which are little time detonate devices you can throw at things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're used for, among other things Bryant blowing up those brick walls is he. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In terms of level difficulty, fire manageable probably takes the top prize at least if you're not equipped for the right weapons - lots of jumping over fiery pits. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And let's not forget the managing blocks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One of the hardest parts of "Mega Man (1)" makes an appearance here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Their first appearance in fire man's level is just, sort of, a warm up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But a bit later in level you'll find yet another series of disappearing blocks that actually carry you across a fire pit and then afterwards a bottomless pit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This would almost certainly eat quite a few lives trying to figure out the blocks patterns unless you have the item number two, in which case you can simply jump on it and sell writer with a fire pit and just jump off at the end; problem solved. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Trust me, this is definitely the easiest way to get past this part of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Fire man is [pretty] easy if you have a bubble man's weapon and if you figured out his attack pattern. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Naturally, one two defeated all the robot masters it's time to deal with Dr. Wily himself who flies off to his castle, which is designed with a surprising number of phallic symbols built into it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Wiley's castle requires you to make use of all your special items to get past certain roadblocks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This right here is one of the trickiest part to actually. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Need to lay out a series of flying platforms very quickly in order to reach the ladder without hitting the ceiling first. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once you somehow managed to do this the very next screen has some flying enemies which will knock you down if you had stayed for even one second or climbing the ladder. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At the end of this first part of Dr. Wily's castle, you will encounter the first large boss a fire-breathing dragon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Not [only] the word about damage for permanent flames but also getting knocked up a block and falling to your death. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Still, he's not really that difficult. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Mega Man <TWO::2>" is a bit longer than the first game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The number of Robot Masters has been bumped up to eight, which would then become a standard for the series. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Wiley's castle is now six levels, each ending with a boss fight. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And as well as being a boss rush in which you know we battle each robot master. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is a tricky memorization based boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have to know where the next block is going to be coming from. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You're standing on a block and activates you'll get hit and there's a bit of energy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Mega Man <TWO::2>" is often described in the games press as a labor of love. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The original "Mega Man" team was commissioned by Capcom to prusa sequel to "Mega Man" in the space between the time they were working on other assigned games like "Legendary Wings". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now it turned out to be an excellent decision since "Mega Man <TWO::2>" was a huge hit, selling a million and a half copies and becoming interested classic. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Received excellent reviews and nowadays if you were to Compile a list of the Top <Ten::10> best N.E.S. games, you would almost certainly be required with "Mega Man <TWO::2>" settle on that list. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Unless you substitute "Mega Man <THREE::3>" instead, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, the influential Japanese guinea mag meatsuit seemed oblivious to its charms and scored an amazing <TWENTY-EIGHT::28> out of <FORTY::40>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Of course, they also gave "Mega Man <THREE::3>" a <TWENTY-THREE::23> out of <FORTY::40> score, so who knows what exactly they were smoking back then. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Mega Man <TWO::2>"'s gameplay revolves around memorization, quick reflexes, and even a bit of quasi-puzzle-solving. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This boss parties crash bomb spiky two laser reports some of which are protected by walls that also need a crash bomb to be destroyed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But you won't have enough bombs to blow up each wall each port. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So you have to use your flying platforms and find the path of getting over walls and using the least number bombs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now at the same time IntraLase reported shooting at you so you have to decide on your course of action quickly before you die. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's actually quite a bit trickier in the books. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As we approached the games, and you'll find yourself in a transporter room that sends you to fight each robot master a second time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Thankfully, you have all the special weapons by now, though, I guess so to the robot masters. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm not even sure if these are the same robot masters or just second copies that Dr. Wily made. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And, of course, in "Mega Man <TWO::2>", there's nothing nearly as hard as the Yellow Devil. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it's really not that tricky to get to the end of the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Another big factor and making the last few levels more easy aren't fattening now have those energy tanks and you can refill your health when you're getting close. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Finally you will encounter Dr. Wily himself and his crazy flying warship. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He's one of those two stage bosses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 First you have to spoil the blast shield, and then just hammer away the front end of it using the metal blades. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But as the ship explodes naturally Dr. Wily escapes him being the tenacious bastard that he is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this leads to a new sixth level underground. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You get this ghost in goblin style progress chart between levels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The last level is super short and has no real enemies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it does have a [pretty] cool start in which materialize in midair and then freefall several screens the bottom of the camera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 All these crazy slime things will go gone if you're not careful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And then at last you reach Wily himself. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And in a shocking twist, he starts flying and transforms into his alien form. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The final boss has a relatively simple pattern based fight. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you get into the rhythm, it's not that different. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But can make a misstep and lose a rhythm it can get tricky real quick. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once you defeat them, you will get an unexpected and funny ending, that I would rank as one of the best in the game endings ever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So what's your opinion on "Mega Man <TWO::2>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It exceeds the original just about every way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It is as video game critics like to say more for find there are more bosses better weapons, more variety in the level design more surprises. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Capcom stripped out some of the extreme difficulty of the first "Mega Man" game and made it a bit more fair enjoyable. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's longer but a password system has been added so you don't have to play it in one sitting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 On the negative side, it was so successful that took the pattern for all the later 'Mega Man' games, and they, sort of, got kind of dog repetitive after a while. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But still, you can't really blame "Mega Man <TWO::2>" for the faults of "Mega Man <FIVE::5>" or "...<SIX::6>". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, "Mega Man <TWO::2>" is probably the best console game Capcom has released so far. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And because it was a massive hit it cemented Capcom reputation as one of the premier game publishers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And it made people stop associating Capcom with stuff like the early Micronics top releases. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it was a major milestone for Capcom. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Guevara 🇯🇵 // Guerrilla War 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 26 🇯🇵 // <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SNK | Smoking Gun Productions 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by SNK 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The last Japanese game of <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> is from S.N.K., "Guevara" though the name "Guerrilla War" also shows very briefly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And "Guevara" his his opposite seems again about Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But when it came time to release it in the U.S. all explicit references to revolutionary Cuba were dropped, though we still get the rather obvious depiction of Castro in the intro. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So "Guerrilla War" is yet another game and S.N.K. series of vertical Run-'n'-Guns along with the 'Car' games and "Heavy Barrel". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 S.N.K. just loves the idea of some guy stomping through the jungle blowing stuff up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here armed with a machine gun and grenades, which are thankfully unlimited. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It actually works very much like "Ikari Warriors" with a little twist. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You also need to rescue P.O.W. charts tied up to stakes like they were which is about to get burned. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Accidentally killing them causes you to lose points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The original version was S.N.K.'s Arcade Game from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It looked an awful lot like karain but with bigger beefier sprites. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You didn't have the same rotary controller scheme. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And once again, <TWO::2>-Player Co-Op is probably the way to go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Incidentally, when you die in the Japanese version, the game clearly shows the names of the characters as being Guevara and Castro, in case you had any doubt. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Beyond the names and the text over the U.S. Japanese versions are [pretty] much identical. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As expected, the home version deals with the loss of rotary controls by having a shoot in the direction face. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This can be a bit awkward at times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now something else borrowed from "Ikari...": tanks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You'll occasionally find empty tanks you can jump into and going a little rampage. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Funnily enough, running over a P.O.W. on your tank somehow rescues them, rather than simply squishing them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You get a variety of special weapons both on-foot and in the tank, such as a contrast-style spread shot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Enemy behavior is a bit different than "Ikari...". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your opponents tend to come out of nowhere, shoot a few rounds out you, then retreat. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They also like to hide in trenches; they often come out of nowhere and surprise you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 All in all "Guerrilla War" fare is better looking than a curry and it has more variety. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Still, I felt a bit lacking in comparison to similar games like "Jackal". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Take this, for example. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Apparently, this is the boss fight. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That dude in the middle there is supposed to be a general and for some reason he is standing there in plain sight while you shoot at him with your tank. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's a [pretty] stupid thing for a general to do. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It just doesn't make any sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 After you've killed him a helicopter appears, which functions as a more conventional boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But still, it feels, sort of, unimpressive compared to the stuff we've been seeing in contemporary Action Games from Konami and Capcom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And the technical issues probably don't really help. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a lot of flicker going on here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This definitely has a negative impact on certain things such as the flame for weapon which looks like a big old pile of dog do. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So "Guerrilla War" is definitely a big step up from stuff like Athena and the two 'Ikari...' games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It shows S.N.K. was headed in the right direction, but is not quite there yet. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 40 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Ah, they're all done at last. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Next time, it's <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Naturally, the pace picks up a bit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, "...Episode <FORTY-ONE::41>" will cover [pretty] much the entire month of January <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, including some U.S. releases. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 On the plus side, we have a [pretty] cool game from VIC TOKAI. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So see you then. 🍇🍌
