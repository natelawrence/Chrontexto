✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey, folks, Dr. Sparkle here, 🍊 and we're lookin' at two 🍋 different versions of "Shinobi". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this little video 🍋 is sort of an addendum 🍋 to "Chronsega Episode 6". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {I} just wanted to clarify 🍋 a few things about 🍋 Ninja Magic in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the Arcade game, you 🍋 can use the Ninja Magic 🍋 exactly once per stage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 ({Do you} see that 🍋 little tornado down there 🍋 next to the time?) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Arcade game 🍋 had a third button 🍋 just for Ninja Magic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You could press it at any time, 🍊 and a hurricane would come along 🍋 {and} wipe out all the enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then, you can use it 🍋 again on the next stage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] even use 'em 🍋 during {a} boss battle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, here's the Tornado Magic; 🍊 [it's] a reasonably 🍋 impressive little effect. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the Arcade version, 🍋 the boss will actually 🍊 appear for a moment, 🍋 shoot a fireball at ya, 🍊 and then disappear 🍋 at the end of each stage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's the actual boss stage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this game, of course, 🍋 you have no Life Bar; 🍋 [a] single hit will kill ya. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's using the Ninja Magic 🍋 during the boss fight 🍊 ({it} takes off four of 🍋 his Health Points). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This definitely makes the 🍋 boss battles [a little bit] easier. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 {I} just have to get 🍋 one more hit in; 🍋 alright, there we go. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And of course, uh, next level, 🍊 I'll actually have a different 🍋 Ninja Magic I can use. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, let's take a look at the 🍋 Sega Master System version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the Master System game, 🍋 you start off with no magic; 🍊 you have to win it in those 🍋 silly little Bonus Rounds 🍊 where ya throw stars at ninjas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the Arcade game, 🍋 those help ya get extra lives, 🍋 so they're still quite important. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I have two hurricane spells 🍋 (up there at the very top) 🍊 but I can't use them yet 'cause I 🍋 haven't killed enough enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you kill a certain 🍋 number of enemies, 🍊 it will start flashing; 🍋 then you can use it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, because 🍋 [of the] Life Bar, 🍊 you don't really need 🍋 [to] use [the] Ninja Magic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It doesn't refill itself 🍋 after each stage, either, 🍊 so if you use it, it's -- it's gone 🍋 until you play another Bonus Round. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, it's flashing, 🍋 so I can use it now, 🍊 but there really aren't 🍋 any situations in this stage 🍋 where I really have [to] use it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, notice my Life Bar 🍋 has been refilled 🍋 from rescuing children. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, as long as I don't 🍋 take too much damage, 🍊 I'm probably gonna go 🍋 into the boss battle 🍋 in [pretty] good shape. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the part 🍋 in the Arcade game 🍋 where I used it; 🍊 but playing it here, 🍋 it seems like I don't 🍋 really need to use it, 🍊 so I'll just go ahead and 🍋 save it for later, I guess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a little more complicated to 🍋 use it in the Master System game; 🍊 ya have to, like, 🍋 hold down one button 🍊 and then press the 🍋 other button twice. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's also not visually 🍋 very impressive 🍊 (like, the screen 🍋 flashes for a second; 🍊 you don't see a tornado 🍋 actually go through). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, boss battle? 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 Can't use [the] Ninja Magic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I was saying, um, on the site 🍋 that this is easier than 🍋 the Arcade version 🍊 because of the Life Bar, but in 🍋 some ways, maybe it's really 🍊 not that easy because 🍋 [of] those darn fireballs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They're really hard to jump over 🍋 (unlike in the Arcade version) 🍊 so expect to take a couple hits, 🍋 but the bottom line is, 🍊 you're gonna have to 🍋 get through this guy 🍋 without using your Ninja Magic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the Magic is really 🍋 not used that much 🍋 in the Master System game. 🍇🍌
