👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 59 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, here we are - 🍋 the long-awaited "...Episode 59", 🍋 covering most of April 1990 - 🍊 perhaps the biggest episode 🍋 of 'Chrontendo' ever. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And by 'biggest', 🍋 I mean in terms of length - 🍊 not in the quality or the 🍋 importance of the games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No; we really got 🍋 a lot of stinkers today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But most of the games are 🍋 interesting in at least weird ways. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "...Episode 59" is anchored 🍋 by three big games - 🍊 all of which are fairly popular 🍋 and which I mostly dislike. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, for whatever reason, 🍋 I became more ambitious than normal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So the scope of this episode 🍋 just kept increasing and increasing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of footage was 🍋 created for this video. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The audio and unedited video 🍋 came out to, like, 🍋 over 300 gigabytes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, anyway, sorry if this episode 🍋 is just too darned long! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, let's get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sculptured Software | Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our final game from March 1990 🍋 before we move on to April: 🍇

✅🏮🍊"Nice shot!"

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Chronturbo' fans will 🍋 recognize this one as 🍊 "Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes 🍋 of Major Championship Golf", 🍊 featuring Jack Nicklaus - 🍋 the legendary golfer 🍊 and a great connoisseur of holes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thi... -- This began life as 🍋 a 1988 Computer Game, 🍊 published by Accolade and 🍋 developed by Sculptured Software. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this was a U.S.-[only] release, 🍋 published by Konami, for some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, on the surface, this is a 🍋 [pretty] standard-looking Golf Game, 🍊 but it does have some eccentricities. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have a few different 🍋 gameplay options - for example, Skins 🍊 (in which you win money 🍋 for each hole ya play). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or ya can also 🍋 just play normal Golf. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can choose between 🍋 live players and computer players. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, there are a number of things 🍋 that appear to be missing from the N.E.S. port 🍊 that were found in the other versions, 🍋 like the ability to play a particular hole 🍊 (which I'm sure would not 🍋 make Mr. Nicklaus happy, 🍊 because, you know, 🍋 this guy is all about the holes). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, this is a [pretty] ugly game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These textures are 🍋 not exactly great. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The screen is kind of shrunk down 🍊 with these wide black 🍋 borders on all sides. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a bit of a step down 🍋 from the Turbografx version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This might be a good opportunity 🍋 to compare the power of the N.E.S. 🍋 to that of the newer console. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The background loads up 🍋 nice and smooth. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This looks a lot like the original 🍋 Computer version of the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The colors are nicer; there's just 🍋 more detail in the landscape. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The N.E.S. version has 🍋 all these blocky textures. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And poor Jack, himself, 🍋 just looks awful. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the handling feels 🍋 a little weird in this version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The PC Engine game 🍋 was [pretty] intuitive 🍋 but the N.E.S. version... 🍊 well, I mean, 🍋 trying to adjust for the wind 🍋 gave me a lot [of] problems. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like here - the wind kept 🍋 pushing my drives to the right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I kept aiming further 🍋 and further to the left 🍊 and then I'd get a ball go way to the left 🍋 (like there was no wind at all). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The PC Engine game just 🍋 feels more natural, somehow. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is not exactly terrible, 🍋 but the PC Engine version 🍋 is simply better all around. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Deep Dungeon IV 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April 06 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HummingBirdSoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Asmik 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 April is here and we begin with 🍋 the first in a punishingly long list 🍋 of J.R.P.G.s released in that month. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First up is "Deep Dungeon IV" 🍋 from HummingBirdSoft - 🍊 the fourth game in the 🍋 'Deep Dungeon' series. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And I don't wanna break 🍋 anyone's heart, out there, 🍊 but this is also 🍋 the last 'Deep Dungeon' game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I know there's a lot of 🍋 'Deep Dungeon' fanatics out there 🍊 and maybe you'll stop 🍋 watching 'Chrontendo', 🍊 now that the 'Deep Dungeon' 🍋 content has dried up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If so, well, I wish you well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, we are blessed with 🍋 an English translation of this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There actually is a little bit 🍋 of a story in the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, right away, we will notice 🍋 the lack of dungeons here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We're actually wandering around 🍋 in a town of some sort. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'Deep Dungeon' games are 🍋 often referred to as 'Wizardry' clones, 🍊 but, by this point, the series has, 🍋 kind of, converted more to, like, 🍋 a '[The] Bard's Tale'-inspired game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are multiple villages, N.P.C.s, 🍋 forests, ...the whole nine yards. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Since we're wrapping up 🍋 the 'Deep Dungeon' series, 🍊 let's take a quick look back 🍋 at how the series started - 🍊 all the way back to 1986 🍋 (which feels like a million years ago). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first "Deep Dungeon" game was 🍋 released for the Famicom Disk System. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was the most basic 🍋 Dungeon Crawler imaginable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You wandered around in a 🍋 non-descript neon-green dungeon, 🍊 looking for loot and fighting 🍋 bog-standard R.P.G. monsters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Each new game in the series 🍋 changed the formula a bit; 🍊 and by "Deep Dungeon III" you 🍋 actually have multiple party members 🍋 and character classes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game also gives you gold 🍋 for defeating monsters, 🍊 unlike the other games in the series 🍋 (in which monsters [only] drop loot 🍋 that you then need to sell). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Deep Dungeon IV" simplifies 🍋 a lot of the game's mechanics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You are back down to one character 🍋 and there's no longer any sort of classes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character is 🍋 totally non-customizable; 🍊 your stats and magic automatically 🍋 improve when you Level Up 🍊 (just like in the 'Dragon Quest' games). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like a lot of 🍋 Western-style R.P.G.s of this era, 🍊 there is a high likelihood of getting 🍋 just totally stomped in battle, 🍊 due to the extremely random 🍋 amount of damage dealt. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, here: I encountered some Goblins 🍋 and a Hobgoblin very early in the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I was doing okay, 🍋 I killed off two Goblins, 🍋 healed a couple times, 🍊 and then (Blam!) 🍋 a Goblin killed me in one blow. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There is a bit of a plot in this game 🍋 and there are quite a few 🍋 N.P.C.s that ya need to talk to. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy gives you a mission 🍋 to fix the water supply. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya need to stomp around 🍋 in this forest 🍊 until you find a dragon who's 🍋 stuck in the reservoir or something. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing to note: 🍋 The maps are [pretty] large 🍋 and very easy to get lost in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's not, like, 🍋 a whole lot of distinguishing 🍋 features in the terrain. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, this is very clearly intended 🍋 to have the player draw out maps 🍋 by hand, while exploring. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are actual 🍋 dungeons in here, as well! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if you're looking for an R.P.G. 🍋 that feels like a very simplified version 🍋 of '...Bard's Tale' or 'Might and Magic', 🍊 then I guess you could, 🍋 hypothetically, play this(?). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, next up, we have... 🍋 another R.P.G.! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Digital Devil Monogatari: Megami Tensei II 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April 06 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atlus
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, Lord! Here we go - 🍋 R.P.G. number two,  🍊 "Digital Devil Story: 🍋 Megami Tensei II", 🍊 published by Namco 🍋 and developed by Atlas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is, of course, a somewhat 🍋 belated sequel to the first 🍊 "...Megami Tensei" game, 🍋 released in 1987. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll be looking at a partial 🍋 translation for this game, 🍊 which will make it somewhat 🍋 easier to play this thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Still, the experience is 🍋 gonna be less than optimal. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I dig the ominous music here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game starts you off 🍋 with a rather strange warning, 🍊 then takes you to a character selection screen, 🍋 and here ya put points into various attributes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you're done, the game starts 🍋 and... Wow! You look like a total dork! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A bit of exploration reveals some N.P.C.s 🍋 that will save your game or sell you items. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You are told you will 🍋 need to kill Taurus 🍊 (or the... the Minotaur, as 🍋 we would normally call him). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another N.P.C. will inform you 🍋 that you're in Daedalus Tower. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, in fact, this beginning 🍋 dungeon is a very accurate recreation 🍊 of the Daedalus Tower area from 🍋 the first "...Megami Tensei" game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though that game, of course, 🍋 used a first-person perspective 🍊 and this one uses 🍋 a top-down perspective. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, after buying some equipment, 🍋 ya head on down one floor and 🍋 begin exploring the dungeon - 🍊 where you'll encounter some 🍋 entry-level 'Megami Tensei' monsters, 🍋 such as the Slime and the Pixie. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, I was unfortunate to 🍋 immediately encounter five [Willowisps], 🍋 and poor Suzi got killed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This means I had to trek 🍋 back up to the top floor 🍋 to heal and revive her. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this guy here is also where 🍋 you go to fuse demons together. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For those familiar with 🍋 the 'Megami Tensei' games, 🍊 you'll know that collecting 🍋 and... breeding(?) demons 🍋 is a major part of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In battle, you can 🍋 choose to talk to demons, 🍋 rather than fighting them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are various tactics 🍋 that you can try, 🍊 like being friendly or trying 🍋 to coerce them to join you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sometimes this works 🍋 and sometimes it doesn't. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, once you have 🍋 some demons in your party, 🍊 you can summon them 🍋 during a fight. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you can give them 🍋 to this guy to fuse! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Doing so will sort of 🍋 smash the demons together 🍋 into a third demon, 🍊 which is usually more powerful 🍋 than the parent demons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Demons can cast spells, 🍋 so creating new demons 🍋 will allow you to access 🍊 some very helpful spells 🍋 (both offensive and defensive). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, once you've leveled up enough 🍊 and ya have a couple 🍋 strong demons on your team, 🍊 it's time to fight The Minotaur 🍋 (who is a bit scrawnier than expected). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the reason you're fighting him 🍋 is to get your hands on this orb he has. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've taken care of him, 🍋 you need to give this orb to a statue 🍋 in another part of the dungeon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then... a plot twist! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya see, it turns out that 🍋 everything in the game, so far, 🍊 has been a video game 🍋 you are playing - 🍊 I mean, not you (the person), but 🍋 you (the character in the video game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though this is something that 🍋 would have been revealed earlier, 🍊 if you had died in 🍋 the Daedalus Tower. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyhoo, it turns out that 🍋 beating the game frees 🍋 someone named Pazuzu. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Ya might remember him 🍋 from the "...Exorcist" movie). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you are granted the ability 🍋 to summon demons in real life. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, real life is 🍋 post-apocalyptic Tokyo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is some sort of, 🍋 like, futuristic shelter 🍊 that is safe from all the 🍋 demons roaming around. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have your typical shops 🍋 and N.P.C.s hanging around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, unfortunately, there are 🍋 gangs of punks that will attack you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And also there are 🍋 zombies, for some reason. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, unfortunately for me, 🍋 in my very first battle in, uh, Tokyo, 🍊 I got jumped by four punks and they 🍋 completely wiped my party out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In addition to money and Experience, 🍋 you also get Magnetite, 🍊 which is used whenever 🍋 you summon a demon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not having enough Magnetite will also 🍋 cause your demons to lose health. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there are going to be some 🍋 difficulties in playing this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a lot of text and this translation 🍋 is nowhere near complete. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As of the time of making this video, 🍋 a brand new full translation 🍊 is either completed 🍋 or very close to complete 🍋 but has not yet been released. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So I'm sorta in the 🍋 same situation I was 🍋 when I did the first game; 🍊 a translation came out, like, right 🍋 after that episode was released! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At the moment, the best 🍋 way to play this game 🍊 might actually be to skip this and 🍋 instead go for the fully-translated 🍋 Super Nintendo remake. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There has been some rebalancing 🍋 and game improvements done. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, you know, I really don't 🍋 like the way this version looks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's been redone to look like the 🍋 'Shin Megami Tensei' games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it feels, like, blander to me; 🍊 the demons kinda lack the character 🍋 of those in the N.E.S. version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So a few other things about this: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The music is really great, for one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Namco used some fancy 🍋 memory mapper chip 🍊 that allowed for 🍋 additional sound channels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "...Megami Tensei II" is sort of 🍋 the game where the series, 🍋 kind of, like, actually starts 🍊 (like, you know, what you and I 🍋 think of when we think of 🍋 "...Megami [Ton...] Tensei"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It drops any connection 🍋 to the original novel. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the main '...Megami Tensei' 🍋 series of games is based on this game, 🍋 rather than the 1987 game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So many characters, mechanics, 🍋 and ideas in later games 🍋 came from "...Megami Tensei II". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even Jack Frost makes 🍋 his first appearance here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is well known 🍋 for having multiple endings, 🍊 including the rather infamous one 🍋 where you fight YHWH as the final Boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the other hand, 🍋 this game can be tedious, 🍋 frustrating, and unbalanced. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But if you are interested, 🍋 keep an eye out for the upcoming 🍋 translation and check it out. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ninja Ryuukenden II 🇯🇵 // Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April 06 🇯🇵 // 1990 May [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tecmo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One [of] the three 🍋 big, big games this episode, 🍊 we have "Ninja Gaiden II: 🍋 ...Dark Sword of Chaos", 🍊 released in April in Japan 🍋 as "Ninja Ryuukenden II". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 An English version hit 🍋 the U.S. very quickly in May. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's start by pointing out 🍋 this fantastic opening 🍊 with its pseudo-parallax scrolling 🍋 and with what looks like 🍊 multiple layers of 🍋 clouds and mountains 🍊 as well as the character 🍋 in the foreground. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Ninja Gaiden (II)..." is one [of] 🍋 the most cinematic video games made. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By which I mean the game's story 🍋 is laid out in many long cutscenes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And these cutscenes 🍋 are very talky. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, outside of these cutscenes, 🍋 virtually nothing happens 🍋 that advances the game's story. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you might recall, 🍋 in the first "Ninja Gaiden" game, 🍋 Ryu defeated Jaquio. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And now Jaquio's Boss, Ashtar, 🍋 is plotting something. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ashtar is one [of] those villains 🍋 who just stands around 🍊 brooding and going, 'Yes, 🍋 everything is going according to plan.', 🍊 right up to the point where they 🍋 get their asses handed to them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 CIA agent Irene 🍋 (who Ryu has the hots for) 🍋 reappears in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, anyway, one year later, 🍋 Ryu is still hanging out 🍋 in New York City. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The handling of Ryu 🍋 is a little different here 🍋 than in the first game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The A and B Buttons are still 🍋 for attacking and jumping. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, 🍋 Ninja Magic reappears as well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This time, all the power-ups 🍋 and such are contained in 🍋 these floating red spheres. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the original game, 🍋 ya had to break candles or lamps 🍋 on the walls to get power-ups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, there's a bit more 🍋 of a 'Castlevania' vibe 🍊 when it came to collecting 🍋 power-ups in the first game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The timing, when it comes to 🍋 hitting the spheres with your sword, 🍊 is actually [pretty] finicky 🍋 and takes a while before 🍋 it becomes second nature. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there is one new 🍋 (and very helpful!) 🍊 Ninja Magic power you can get - 🍋 a duplicate (or Shadow Ninja) 🍊 that follows you around 🍋 at a slight delay. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The manual awkwardly calls this 🍋 power 'splitting your body'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The great thing about the 🍋 Shadow Ninja is it's capable of attacking 🍋 but cannot take damage, itself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Learning to effectively use the 🍋 Shadow Ninja is enormously helpful! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's also something I never really 🍋 got very good at, while playing this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] first Boss, Dando - the cursed, 🍋 is far and away the easiest. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just attack and then jump 🍋 on a wall when he charges at you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After each Boss battle, 🍋 you'll get a cutscene; 🍊 and there are many, many 🍋 cutscenes in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here you're first introduced to Robert - 🍋 a sleeveless blonde Special Forces dude - 🍊 who, unlike Ryu, seems to know 🍋 what the hell is going on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually kind of funny 🍋 how clueless Ryu is in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He has to have literally everything 🍋 explained to him by the other characters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 2nd Stage begins with a 🍋 short train ride to the mountains. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Such favorite enemies 🍋 such as the Eagle reappear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you then ascend the 🍋 mountain in a snowstorm. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And here the game deploys 🍋 a rather clever gimmick. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The wind pushes you back, 🍋 while blowing against you - 🍊 or pushes you forward, 🍋 if it's blowing in the direction 🍋 that you're moving. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you need to factor in the wind, 🍋 when jumping across these chasms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you jump against the wind 🍋 you'll not be able to jump far enough 🍋 and will fall to your death. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another thing: 🍋 "Ninja Gaiden II..." has a timer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the timer is 🍋 actually kinda brutal! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You really cannot 🍋 dick around in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While fighting the second Boss, 🍋 Baron Spider(?) 🍊 (whose backstory in the manual is 🍋 almost identical to Spider-Man's) - 🍊 when fighting him - I came within 🍋 three seconds of running out of time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, to be honest I'd 🍋 never played past Level 2, 🍋 before playing this for 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I was actually getting a bit 🍋 tired of the wind bit in this level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I was thinkin', 'Okay, 🍋 at least I'm past that gimmick level.'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, it turns out 🍋 the joke was on me! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Ninja Gaiden II..." is full 🍋 of gimmick levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, Level 3 is the lightning level - 🍋 meaning that the level is pitch black 🍋 except for when lightning flashes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the weird thing is, it looks like 🍋 these stone walls are just, like, 🍋 sitting on the ground 🍊 (so that if you fell off one, 🍋 you would just land on the ground 🍋 and would need to climb back up). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, nope! 🍋 You will, in fact, fall into a bottomless pit 🍋 and die if you fall off one [of] the walls. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Each level in "Ninja Gaiden (II)..." 🍋 is broken into several areas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, the timer 🍋 resets in each new area; 🍊 and, if you die, you'll restart 🍋 in the same area you died in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thankfully, this part [of] the level 🍋 ditches the lightning thing; 🍊 but it still has plenty of opportunities 🍋 to fall to your death. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Boss number three is 🍋 a robot, named... (hmm... 🍊 well, according to the manual, 🍋 he's named) 'Funky Dynamite'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And his various projectiles 🍋 can be a huge pain, 🍊 unless he just happens to position himself 🍋 where his rockets will pass over your head 🍊 and you can hit him, 🍋 while jumping up and down. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you've rescued Irene 🍋 from Funky Dynamite; 🍊 and then Ashtar turns up 🍋 and makes fun of you! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At this point, the cutscenes 🍋 start getting longer and longer... 🍋 and more dialogue-heavy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's often a long 🍋 cutscene at the end of a level - 🍊 and then another cutscene 🍋 at the start [of] the next level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Robert shows up again, 🍋 shoots Ashtar, and then tells him 🍋 the whole area is surrounded. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, Ashtar takes off with Irene. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Robert, again, has to 🍋 explain what's going on to Ryu; 🍊 and tells him to follow Ashtar 🍋 into the underground maze. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The underground level 🍊 (despite being decked out 🍋 with fiery pits everywhere) 🍊 is not that bad, at first. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing that really 🍋 bugged me about "Heavy Barrel", 🍊 from a couple episodes ago, 🍋 was the blind power-ups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's far too easy to downgrade your 🍋 weapons by opening up the chests. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can get a weaker weapon 🍋 than you already have. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the same thing is true here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Many times you will find that 🍋 it's gonna be very difficult 🍊 to slash a power-up sphere 🍋 (with your sword) 🍊 without actually collecting 🍋 the power-up, 🍊 meaning that you might unintentionally 🍋 get a less useful Ninja Magic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In 'Castlevania' you can generally 🍋 break open candles from a distance, 🍊 so you can see what sub-weapon 🍋 it contains before you pick it up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, in 'Ninja Gaiden', 🍋 that's often not the case. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the other hand, many spheres 🍋 contain Life Bar and Magic Bar 🍋 extensions and refills - 🍊 and these are vital 🍋 to beating the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you really have to 🍋 slash open as many power-up 🍋 spheres as you can. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the game has 🍋 quite a few spheres in, like, 🍋 out-of-the-way places; 🍊 and getting to them 🍋 can waste valuable time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Remember, you have to start 🍋 all the way from the beginning 🍋 of an area if the timer runs out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, a certain amount of memorization 🍋 is required to know which spheres 🍋 to collect and which to avoid. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this area is 🍋 just annoying as hell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The water keeps continuously 🍋 pushing you backward 🍊 and there's tons of opportunities 🍋 to fall off ledges. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this Boss battle, 🍋 these weird giant claws 🍋 come out to attack you; 🍊 but you actually need to attack 🍋 the completely stationary head, 🍋 up at the top. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, again, there's all this 🍋 flowing water that'll push you 🍊 off the ledges to your death, 🍋 if you're not careful. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, after this, Ashtar 🍋 taunts you a bit more 🍊 and you continue through 🍋 the underground world. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This part has lots of 🍋 spikes and fire. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And ya might be hoping that 🍋 the gimmick levels are over, 🍊 but then we get to an ice area. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And in games like "Avoid the Noid" 🍋 ice levels are obnoxious, 🍊 but in 'Ninja Gaiden', 🍋 they are just plain sadistic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Finally, it's time to square off 🍋 against Ashtar and rescue Irene. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, Ashtar (the big jerk!) 🍋 decides to stab her with 🍋 the titular Dark Sword. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh... 🍋 Oh! This part looks kinda dirty! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Naturally, Robert shows up again 🍋 and points his Glock at Ashtar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then we finally get 🍋 the f... big showdown 🍋 between Ryu and Ashtar. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Pretty] much all the battles 🍋 are much easier with 🍋 the Shadow Ninja duplicates, 🍊 since they allow you to 🍋 damage a Boss, while 🍋 standing out of harm's way. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so you've defeated Ashtar 🍋 but, you know, 🍋 he's not really defeated. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's still going to call 🍋 the powers of darkness 🍋 to destroy the world or whatever. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And Irene is lookin' [pretty] healthy 🍋 for someone who just got impaled 🍋 on a giant demon sword. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At this point, the game 🍋 switches it up a bit with a 🍋 very short post-boss area, 🍊 leading to this impressive 🍋 reveal of Ashtar's castle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then we get a short cutscene 🍋 where Irene and Robert 🍋 run into this mysterious figure. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Boy! 🍋 Who could this possibly be? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the run up to the castle is 🍋 [pretty] straightforward (no gimmicks) 🍊 but it's still packed with 🍋 tons of annoying enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, if you've played 🍋 "Ninja Gaiden (I)", 🍊 you kinda know 🍋 how this game operates. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Multiple enemies will 🍋 attack you at once, 🍊 often pushing you back, 🍋 causing you to hit other enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game (as I mentioned) 🍋 is [pretty] damn sadistic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this Boss, right here, 🍋 drove me crazy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's two of these guys 🍋 but [only] one can be damaged. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Those of you with good memories 🍋 will recognize these guys from 🍋 the first "Ninja Gaiden" game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were the Boss 🍋 of the 4th Level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so we now 🍋 get more cutscenes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, at this point, 🍋 Robert shows up (yet again) 🍊 and lets you know that Irene 🍋 had been kidnapped (again). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 She spends [pretty] much 🍋 the whole game kidnapped. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I almost feel that 🍋 maybe Robert would be better 🍋 suited to this job than Ryu. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Despite being a normal 🍋 human being without magic powers, 🍊 he seems to have no problem 🍋 dealing with hordes of monsters - 🍊 and manages several times 🍋 to sneak up on Ryu 🍊 (who is, you know, 🍋 a ninja, mind you). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh good! We are finally at 🍋 the seventh (and last) level, 🍊 which is just non-stop 🍋 'Ninja Gaiden'-style bullshit 🍊 (just throwing tons of 🍋 fast enemies at you). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, honestly, I was ready for 🍋 the game to be over, at this point. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A number of people feel this 🍋 is easier than the first game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, yeah, they did 🍋 change some things - 🍊 like, for example, 🍋 Ryu's climbing ability. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can just climb up walls now, 🍋 without having to, like, 🍊 jump back and forth - 🍋 from one wall to the other. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And if you die, 🍋 during the final level, 🍊 they don't send you 🍋 all the way back to the 🍋 beginning in that level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, despite these changes, 🍋 I still found this game to be, like, 🍊 (I don't know) 🍋 absolutely exhausting. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, the final Boss is Jaquio 🍋 (who is alive, for some reason) 🍊 and now he's got 🍋 the dark power of evil. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The final Boss battle 🍋 is a three-parter. (Oh boy!). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First he appears in 🍋 his form from the first game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He flies around and ya stab him 🍋 or use your Ninja Magic on him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, ya don't get 🍋 any health or magic refills, 🍊 so you're gonna have to play 🍋 a bit cleaner than I did here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Trust me; I was not going for 🍋 a perfect run in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I was just trying to get 🍋 to the end any way I could. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so here's 🍋 another cutscene. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And (Damn!) 🍋 that's a lot [of] blood! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 How did this thing get a 🍋 Nintendo Seal of Quality? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The blood awakens the sword, ... 🍊...Irene gets electrocuted, ... 🍊...Jaquio comes back to life, 🍋 and Ryu remains very confused. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The second Boss is just 🍋 a scary head that you've got to attack 🍋 while he coughs up meatballs - 🍊 and some kind of icky fluid oozes down 🍋 from a number of ceiling orifices. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is actually a little gross. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then, Ryu's sword 🍋 becomes infused with power; 🍊 and we are finally at the final part 🍋 of our battle with Jaquio. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You must stab his face, 🍋 while avoiding his hands and 🍋 the stuff that he spits at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you can focus on 🍋 this relatively defenseless 🍋 body part, right here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, honestly, 🍋 are we attacking his balls? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now that the evil forces 🍋 have been defeated, 🍋 we see the evil castle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (I'm not sure if this is 🍋 Ashtar's castle or Jaquio's castle.). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, Ryu is sad because 🍋 his girlfriend is dead. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, honestly, I mean, 🍊 does he even really 🍋 know her that well? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, they hung out a bit 🍋 in the first game 🍊 but were they ever, like, 🍋 officially even dating? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Either way, Ryu's sword 🍋 brings her back to life 🍋 and we get a happy ending. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In a lot [of] ways, "Ninja Gaiden II..." 🍋 is a major accomplishment. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Its use of cutscenes was 🍋 [pretty] much unprecedented 🍋 in scope, for an N.E.S. game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On the other hand, 🍋 the cutscenes have almost nothing 🍋 to connect them to the actual game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's like the story stops 🍋 after each cutscene, 🍊 Ryu then runs through a gauntlet of enemies 🍋 (who've never [appeared] in the cutscenes), 🍊 and then we get more cutscenes, 🍋 in which the plot is moved along 🍊 by Ryu and Ashtar 🍋 yakking at each other. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another thing that bugs me 🍋 is how weirdly random 🍋 the normal enemies are. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A typical level will contain 🍋 mundane animals like 🍋 bats, eagles, giant spiders, 🍊 but also various demon-like creatures, 🍊 not to mention Jason from 🍋 the 'Friday The 13th' movies, 🍊 camouflage-wearing Army guys, 🍊 and a number of weird things that 🍋 I can't really tell what they are. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It almost feels like a bunch of 🍋 rejected enemies from other games 🍊 were all, kinda, like, 🍋 tossed into this one. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On paper, 🍋 this game seems very cool. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, the music is great, 🍊 the visual design is excellent, 🍋 it has so many great textures, 🍊 most [of] the Bosses are, like, 🍋 these huge multi-sprite behemoths - 🍊 yet I just hated playing this thing! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it felt like a chore to me. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I understand a lot [of] people 🍋 love this game, 🍊 but ehhh... meh... 🍋 for me, I don't know. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After this, of course, Tecmo 🍋 would release "Ninja Gaiden III" 🍊 and then a h... few [handheld] games 🍋 and a Master System game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, the series otherwise was 🍋 ignored by Tecmo for an entire decade, 🍊 until "Ninja Gaiden" 🍋 for the XBOX came along 🍊 (which, you know, might really 🍋 be the [only] 'Ninja Gaiden' 🍋 game that I actually like). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, let's continue on through April 🍋 with some less memorable games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ultraman Club 2: Kittekita Ultraman Club 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April 07 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Interlink
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's an odd one: 🍋 "Ultraman Club 2" from Bandai, 🍊 developed by a short-lived 🍋 company called Interlink. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there's really nothing 🍋 weird about the game itself; 🍊 it's a [pretty] standard licensed game 🍋 from a very prolific publisher. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like the last Bandai game 🍋 we covered (the Akuma-kun game) 🍊 it is a quickie R.P.G. cash-in title. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Rather, the odd thing about it 🍋 is its place in video game history 🍊 as the first credit for a well-known 🍋 figure in the game industry. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, your first impression 🍋 is probably gonna be that 🍋 this looks really trashy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a pre-credits prologue, 🍋 in which Ultraman fights some 🍋 monster dudes and gets knocked out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 He awakens in one of those 🍋 standard R.P.G. 'first village's 🍊 (except that there's even less 🍋 to do than there are in 🍋 most R.P.G. first villages). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Basically, you can talk 🍋 to the villagers and that's it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as far as R.P.G.s go, 🍊 "Ultraman Club 2" is 🍋 [pretty] stripped down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no armor, weapons, 🍋 or even items to buy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's clearly aimed at 🍋 a younger audience 🍊 and the game is relatively short. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 That doesn't mean 🍋 it's easy, though! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I got murdered by 🍋 the second encounter 🍊 and I had to restart 🍋 back at the village. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game will sometimes throw 🍋 way too many enemies at you; 🍊 and it certainly 🍋 doesn't feel balanced. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your first objective is to 🍋 make it to the Ultraman base. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there were many, many 🍋 Ultraman TV shows and movies and such; 🍊 and this game sorta, like, 🍋 brings together characters 🍋 from all those different series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ultraman was kind of like Shazam. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It just started as just one guy; 🍊 and a few years later down the road 🍋 there's, like, a whole army of them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The idea of bringing together 🍋 different variations of one character 🍋 is still [pretty] popular. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, that, uh, 'Spider-Man' 🍋 animated movie that came out 🍋 a few years ago. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first 'Ultraman Club' game 🍋 hit shelves way back in 1987, 🍊 right around the same time that 🍋 "Zelda II" and "Dragon Quest II" 🍋 were released. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was actually a 🍋 Famicom Disk System game; 🍊 that's how old it was. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I've] no idea why Bandai 🍋 suddenly decided to revive it, 🍋 after such a long time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, like I was saying, 🍊 Ultraman is an R.P.G. that's just... 🍋 stripped down to the bare bones. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You don't really have 'items' 🍋 or 'magic' or 'healing potions', 🍊 but there are a few things 🍋 that take their place. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In battle, you can sometimes 🍋 use special attacks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These appear to be 🍋 completely random; 🍊 they just show up 🍋 in the menu sometimes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They actually appear [pretty] frequently, 🍊 so you should be able to 🍋 use at least several of them 🍋 in a typical battle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Later in the game, you will get 🍋 capsules that contain friendly monsters 🍋 that can be used in battle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Certain capsule monsters 🍋 will fight for you; 🍊 others will function 🍋 much like normal R.P.G. spells 🍊 (such as healing the party, 🍋 warping you out of a dungeon, 🍋 or so on). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For the first part [of] the game, however, 🍊 you'll need to return to the base, 🍋 in order to heal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you'll probably have to 🍋 do this quite a lot. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I mentioned earlier that a 🍋 prominent individual in the gaming world 🍋 was involved in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Ultraman Club 2" is, in fact, 🍋 the first video game credit for Kenji Eno, 🍊 who would later (in 1990) found 🍋 his own development company, EIM, 🍋 and release a few Famicom games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later in the decade, 🍋 he would become a notable figure 🍋 in both the U.S. and Japan 🍊 for such titles as "Enemy Zero" 🍋 and the two 'D' games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the 2000s, he focused 🍋 more on mobile games, 🍊 before dying of a heart attack 🍋 at the age of 42. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If nothing else, "Ultraman Club 2" 🍋 earns a place as a footnote in 🍋 the history of video games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, this game is 🍋 insanely grindy at first. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Before you could even think of 🍋 entering the first dungeon, 🍊 you'd better spend a lot [of] time 🍋 flying around, 🍊 building up several levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And remember, 🍋 you've gotta be tough enough 🍊 to make it through the dungeon 🍋 and beat the first Boss, 🍊 without the ability to heal. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to land 🍋 on this little island, 🍋 shaped like eyeglasses 🍊 (which is actually called 🍋 Eyeglass Island, apparently). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then ya have to 🍋 make your way through 🍊 this extremely ugly dungeon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It makes sense to run 🍋 from every battle, if possible. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll probably have 🍋 around 40-some Hit Points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, while most enemies 🍋 do small amounts of damage, 🍊 every so often one will use 🍋 a special attack and take off, 🍋 like, 10 Hit Points or so. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the encounter rate 🍋 is extremely high, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It feels like every three steps 🍋 you'll be in a fight. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I was down to about 30 Hit Points 🍋 when I finally reached the Boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, I was able 🍋 to take him down 🍋 in about four rounds. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At this point, you will have 🍋 rescued Ultraman Ace - 🍊 who just happens to have 🍋 some capsules on him, 🍊 which is good news! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned earlier, 🍊 these are basically 🍋 one-use magic spells, 🍊 so you can use a capsule to 🍋 warp you out of the dungeon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's not really 🍋 much else going on here, 🍊 except to take a trip to a nearby village 🍋 and discover an underground passage, 🍊 which will lead you to another 🍋 Boss battle against this guy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After you waste him, 🍋 his body is seen just lying on the floor 🍊 (which is actually [pretty] 🍋 unusual for an N.E.S. R.P.G.). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The plot thickens a bit here, 🍊 as you find a bunch of 🍋 UFOs in the basement. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ultraman Ace gets captured again... 🍊...which will lead you to the 🍋 game's second area - the Moon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a total of five 🍋 areas in this game; 🍊 and it takes around five hours 🍋 to complete, which (in my opinion) 🍊 is just way too much time 🍋 to spend on this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure there are probably 🍋 worse kiddy R.P.G.s on the system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, even if you like 🍋 really obscure Famicom R.P.G.s, 🍊 I would not bother with this one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gunhed: Aratanaru Tatakai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April 13 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?]
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Varie 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, here's a piece of junk 🍋 that no one knows or cares about: 🍊 "Gunhed: Aratanaru Tatakai" 🍋 - from Varie. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Does the name Varie ring a bell? 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 Probably not. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've seen a few Varie 🍋 games in 'Chrontendo', 🍊 but I doubt you can remember 🍋 a single one of them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Gunhed: Aratanaru Tatakai" 🍋 is a tile-based Strategy Game, 🍊 adapted from Toho's 1989 🍋 live-action Sci-Fi movie, "Gunhed". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's about a big robot, 🍋 named Gunhed 🍊 (or 'Gun Unit: 🍋 Heavy Elimination Device'). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Despite this game 🍋 being totally obscure, 🍊 someone did produce an 🍋 unofficial English translation - 🍊 which makes it a bit easier to play - 🍊 but it still doesn't make 🍋 much sense to me. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Before we go any further, 🍋 let's state the obvious: 🍊 this is the second 'Gunhed' game 🍊 (the first being, of course, the Turbografx 16 title, 🍋 known as "Blazing Lasers" in the U.S.). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This Compile-developed game 🍋 was one of the greatest console 🍋 Shoot-'em-Ups of the late 80s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, I'd much rather 🍋 be playing "Blazing Lasers" 🍊 instead of 🍋 "Gunhed: Aratanaru Tatakai". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you wanna see more "Blazing Lasers", 🍋 check out "Chronturbo Episode 4". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Gunhed" (the movie) 🍋 was apparently a [pretty] huge flop, 🍊 so it's no surprise that this game has 🍋 fallen into extreme obscurity 🍊 (and for good reason - 🍋 I'm sure you've noticed the music). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once the game itself starts, 🍋 the music is a bit better 🍊 and the graphics are... 🍋 functional, I suppose(?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya start off with a few robots 🍊 and place 'em at various 🍋 points on the island. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The enemy or the other 🍋 player does the same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then ya stomp around 🍋 the island, collecting parts 🍊 and fighting enemy robots, 🍋 if you wish. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The various parts you pick up 🍋 appear to be the key to this game, 🍊 as they can improve your robots 🍋 and build new robots. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Fighting can be done manually 🍋 or automatically (or partially automatic). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The robots all seem to have 🍋 different weapons and abilities 🍊 and I got just destroyed 🍋 in every single battle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On the island, you'll also find 🍋 various buildings that refill your energy 🍋 when you visit them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The main goal here appears 🍋 to be to build new robots 🍊 until you have a robot army 🍋 capable of defeating the enemy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, when I played this game, 🍊 the enemy was much more 🍋 successful at this than I was. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, if you keep 🍋 marching around the island, 🍊 you'll find lots of spare 🍋 robot legs and arms and stuff. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Supposedly, the best strategy is 🍋 simply to try to avoid the enemy - 🍊 while building up 🍋 your stock of robots. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently, the enemy robots 🍋 will start to run out of gas at some point 🍊 and then you can easily begin 🍋 picking off the opposing forces. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I didn't get very far into this, 🍋 but it looks like the game 🍋 ends with this Boss battle, 🍊 based on this one playthrough 🍋 I found online. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And apparently it takes 🍋 around an hour or so to beat. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned earlier, 🍋 this game is obscure. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no English guides online; 🍊 and on Niconico I found 🍋 exactly one video 🍊 of someone playing this thing 🍋 for more than a few minutes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Everything else is just brief 🍋 samples of game music and such. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so we've got our super obscure 🍋 game out [of] the way, today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's move on to something else. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Quarth 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April 13 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, we've got two 🍋 Konami games this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, while the 🍋 "Jack Nicklaus..." game wasn't that hot, 🍊 I have to inform you that this one, 🍋 "Quarth", isn't really a big deal either. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Quarth" is a barely-remembered 🍋 Action-y Puzzle-y game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike "Tetris", the single-player 🍋 mode isn't particularly addictive; 🍊 and the various 2 Player options 🍋 are really the way to go. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing, however: 🍋 You can choose which level you start on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first level is the easiest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the concept behind "Quarth" 🍋 seems [pretty] clear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Someone at Konami 🍋 remembered that "Space Invaders" 🍋 was a very popular game 🍊 and "Tetris" was also 🍋 a very popular game, 🍊 so why not somehow combine 🍋 them into one game? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like "Space Invaders", 🍋 the enemy slowly marches down 🍋 the screen towards you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If they reach that dotted line 🍋 above your ship, you'll die, 🍊 so you must 🍋 blast away relentlessly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, instead of firing lasers, 🍋 you shoot blocks, 🍊 in order to fill up the gaps, so that 🍋 a perfect rectangle is formed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once this happens, 🍋 all the blocks that make up 🍋 the rectangle disappear. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I'm not really sure 🍋 I'm doing this correctly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 To maximize your points, 🍋 ya need to rack up combos. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That is, if you plan 🍋 a bit more carefully, 🍊 you can take out a series of 🍋 contiguous rectangles at once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You don't have to fill in all 🍋 the holes in the middle of the rectangle, 🍊 as long as the entire 🍋 perimeter is filled in. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, honestly, 🍋 I mostly failed to do this 🍊 because I'm just not a very good strategist 🍋 when it comes to this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I did not study "Tetris" knockoffs 🍋 at West Point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not exactly the Napoleon 🍋 of filling in rectangles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, honestly, this game 🍋 does get [pretty] hard! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each level is a little 🍋 faster than the [last]; 🍊 and, by the final level, 🍋 you will need to be, like, 🍋 super fast and precise, 🍊 when it comes to 🍋 laying down the blocks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Quarth" originated in Arcades 🍋 in Fall 1989, 🍊 so Konami must have really 🍋 hustled this onto consoles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the U.S., it was released 🍋 in Arcades as "Block Hole". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A somewhat more 🍋 dramatic intro is seen here, 🍊 compared to the Famicom version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The thing didn't really make 🍋 much of a splash in the U.S., 🍊 but it was apparently a [pretty] decent hit 🍋 for Konami in Japan and Europe. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 About a month before this, 🍋 "Quarth" was released in Japan 🍋 on the Game Boy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, if you've heard of "Quarth" at all, 🍊 it's probably because of this being 🍋 released in 1990 in the United States. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't believe it was 🍋 really that big of a seller, 🍊 but I'm sure it scratched that 🍋 "Tetris"-like itch for some people. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Quarth" appears to be still somewhat 🍋 remembered in Japan, even today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There was a port for the [M.S.X. 2] 🍋 that was released on the Wii 🍋 and the Wii U in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the game is now even 🍋 available on the Switch. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There is really nothing 🍋 wrong with "Quarth". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It just feels kind of like a 🍋 bush-league version of "Tetris". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 God Slayer 🇯🇵 // Crystalis 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April 13 🇯🇵 // 1990 July [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SNK
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by SNK 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 April 13th of 1990 is a 🍋 somewhat cursed day. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from "Gunhed" and "Quarth", 🍋 we have this very unusual item from SNK, 🍊 "God Slayer: Haruka Tenku no Sanada". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, don't get too excited. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike "...Megami Tensei II", 🍋 this is not one of those J.R.P.G.s 🍋 where ya fight God. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I have no idea what 🍋 the title is actually referring to. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, you and I 🍋 know this game as "Crystalis", 🍊 released three months later 🍋 in the U.S. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, according to this game's intro, 🍋 due to... lightning strikes(?) 🍊 the world ends a mere seven years 🍋 after this game was released. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently, folks in 1997 🍋 were very technologically advanced, 🍊 since they responded to 🍋 this nuclear war (or whatever) 🍊 by building a giant floating tower 🍋 that will wipe out all evil. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the game itself 🍋 takes place in 2097. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the war caused lots of 🍋 Fantasy-style monsters to appear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And society now exists 🍋 in the form of various small villages, 🍊 whose predominant forms of commerce 🍋 are Inns, Armor and Weapon Shops, 🍋 and occasionally Bars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One might say 🍋 the world has been J.R.P.G.-ified. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the manual, on the other hand, 🍋 tells a slightly different story. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Tower (which contains 🍋 a powerful computer) 🍊 was created by an evil 🍋 wizard, named Draygon, 🍊 who also hid these four 🍋 magical swords around the world 🍋 so they couldn't be used against him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then, four good wizards 🍋 learned of a powerful wizard 🍊 who was frozen in a cave 🍋 and then woke him up, 🍋 so that he could defeat Draygon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And... that wizard is you! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, ya wake up 🍋 (with no memory, apparently) 🍋 and wander around the opening village. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The technology to make concrete 🍋 was apparently lost in the war, 🍊 so every road is 🍋 made out of cobblestones. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, ya talk to everyone 🍋 in the village and find that 🍊 the wizard, Zebu, has left 🍋 some money lying around for you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, this guy gives you a sword 🍋 (specifically the Wind Sword), 🍊 which is one of the four magic 🍋 swords that the wizards hid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know how this guy got it, 🍋 but it's very convenient. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, while you're in town, 🍋 you might as well buy 🍋 some crappy armor. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, as you can guess, 🍋 we are going to go out 🍋 and slay some monsters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, actually, the monsters are 🍋 kinda scarce around these parts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Crystalis" is an Action R.P.G., 🍋 similar to "...Legend of Zelda". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Though I guess it feels 🍋 more like "Ys" than anything else 🍊 (except, of course, that 🍋 "Ys" is a lot of fun 🍊 and "Crystalis" is... not so fun(?). 🍋 We'll see.). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Zebu (one of the four wizard guys) 🍋 is hanging out in this cave. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Zebu will teach you magic spells, 🍊 but [only] if you perform 🍋 some chores for him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The guy's all, 'Sorry, dude; 🍋 I know you're the [only] one 🍋 who can save the world, 🍊 but first of all you gotta 🍋 go fix the windmill.' 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, you should be 🍋 grinding for Experience - 🍊 walking around and killing 🍋 some Slimes and Tiger Men 🍊 (which are worth one and two 🍋 Experience Points, respectively). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, so basically there's gonna be 🍋 a lot of grinding in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Gaining Levels increases 🍋 your Life Bar and your Magic Bar 🍊 and you also have 🍋 Strength and Defense stats. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, while Leveling Up doesn't 🍋 directly give you any new abilities, 🍊 you will need to be at certain Levels 🍋 to enter some areas or 🍋 perform some actions. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, even if you are 🍋 really good at the game, 🍊 you can't beat the game 🍋 at a low Level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [pretty] much have to 🍋 Level Up all the way. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the windmill is 🍋 [pretty] far away from town 🍊 and ya have to go through 🍋 a cave to get there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll find a sleeping dude. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 How do ya wake him up? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, the manual says the 🍋 Alarm Flute will wake him up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, the Alarm Flute 🍋 is sold in the town's Item Shop 🍋 for 50 bucks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This will, more than likely, 🍋 [pretty] much take up all your money. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a lot of flutes in this game - 🍊 though if we take a look at them, 🍋 you'll notice that they 🍋 are technically ocarinas. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, ya wake up this dude, 🍊 he gives ya the key 🍋 to start the [windmill], 🍊 and hints at a strange Ball 🍋 hidden in the caves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As a reward, Zebu teaches 🍋 you the Heal spell, 🍊 which the game calls 'Refresh'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can then enter the 🍋 first real dungeon of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I do kinda like some stuff here 🍊 (like this part where you can, 🍋 like, walk under bridges; 🍊 it's a rather clever graphical trick). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One of "Crystalis"' main fighting 🍋 mechanics is charging up your sword. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Holding down the B Button 🍋 will allow you to unleash 🍋 a powerful ranged attack, 🍊 which is helpful because you can 🍋 kill monsters from a distance. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you pick up the 🍋 aforementioned Ball for the Wind Sword, 🍊 you can now charge your 🍋 sword up to two Levels - 🍊 which unleashes a blast powerful enough 🍋 to break through certain walls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, by the way, you have to be, 🍋 like, all the way pressed up 🍋 against the wall for this to work 🍊 (something that isn't obvious 🍋 when playing this for the first time). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is one [of] the main mechanics - 🍋 charging up your weapons 🍋 and breaking walls. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Leveling up your sword 🍋 allows you to kill stronger monsters 🍊 and to break through walls 🍋 and enter new areas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, your goal here is to 🍋 make your way to the first Boss 🍋 (a vampire) 🍊 then, of course, defeat him 🍋 and obtain the Rabbit Boots. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These will allow you to 🍋 jump when equipped. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya see, certain areas 🍋 are blocked by toxic swamps, 🍊 which damage you 🍋 when you walk across them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Jumping through them 🍋 reduces the damage you take, 🍊 so you can get to 🍋 the other side of the lake alive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are ten different 🍋 areas in this game 🍊 with each being usually connected 🍋 by a small passage near either 🍋 the top or bottom of the map. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This area right here is 🍋 number two, Cordel Plain. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a lot of irritating 🍋 things about "Crystalis" 🍊 and we encounter 🍋 one [of] those things here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some enemies cannot be 🍋 harmed by certain swords. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Wind Sword has 🍋 no effect on Mushrooms. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, ya know, sure a lot of R.P.G.s 🍋 have something similar to this - 🍊 but in "Crystalis" 🍋 it gets really tiresome 🍊 (especially as you get 🍋 further into the game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the game is structured 🍋 so that you are frequently 🍋 running into dead ends 🍊 until you just happen to find 🍋 some particular item or person 🍊 or perform some action 🍋 in order to move forward. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like this swampy area: 🍋 The air is poisoned - 🍊 so, after you've obtained 🍋 the Rabbit Boots, 🍊 you'll need to then get the Gas Mask, 🍋 in order to survive this part. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a town here, 🍋 but it doesn't provide any clues 🍋 as to what to do next. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can talk to everyone, 🍋 but they don't really 🍋 say anything of interest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you keep wandering around 🍋 until ya run into another wizard, Tornel, 🍋 and he makes ya fight this dude. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then he says 🍋 to look for the Tornado Bracelet 🍊 and gives you the 🍋 power of telepathy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Which, according to the manual, 🍋 allows you to talk to animals - 🍋 or communicate with Wise Men - 🍊 and sometimes hear 🍋 hints about the story. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It sounds handy but ya 🍋 can't really use it too much yet 🍊 since you don't have 🍋 very many Magic Points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, still there's no clues 🍋 as to where to go next. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] turns out, you have to 🍋 go back to the Swamp Village [and] 🍋 use telepathy on the townspeople - 🍊 which will then unlock a dialogue option 🍋 with a lady whose kid is missing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Naturally, you gotta find the kid, 🍋 bring him back, 🍊 his mom gives you the Insect Flute, 🍋 which (as per the manual) 🍊 will summon a Giant Insect 🍋 if you play it in the right place. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Where is this place? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess 🍋 just keep trying until ya find it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once ya find the right spot 🍋 and you kill the Giant Beetle, 🍊 he will drop the Ball of Fire, 🍊 which will power up the 🍋 Sword of Flame one Level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why would a Giant Beetle 🍋 have the Fire Stone? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Again, I have no idea. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, having quest items and such 🍋 is not new in video games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, compared to something 🍋 like "...Legend of Zelda", 🍊 there are an awful lot 🍋 of these damn things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And a lot of them are 🍋 not really necessarily clear 🍋 as to what they're used for. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like the X-Ray Goggles are used 🍋 just once in the game, I believe, 🍊 when you have to walk 🍋 into some random house 🍊 and use them to h... look 🍋 for a hidden entrance. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Crystalis" certainly feels 🍋 like it just makes you run 🍋 all over the damn place, 🍊 looking for random 🍋 Statues, Flutes, and Lamps. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it s... it sort of 🍋 uses this as a way to, like, 🍊 stretch out the game time, 🍋 it feels like. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the environments 🍋 feel a bit samey. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most [of] the dungeons 🍋 look very similar - 🍊 long corridors which occasionally 🍋 have a 90-degree turn 🍋 or a three-way intersection. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's easy to get lost, 🍊 simply because every corridor 🍋 looks virtually the same. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 With a few exceptions, 🍋 the pattern is basically: 🍊 visit a village, maybe enter a little cave 🍋 or a house out in the [overworld] 🍊 and talk to some guy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then enter a dungeon, 🍋 blast through some blocked walls 🍊 with your [powered]-up sword, 🍋 and eventually make it to the Boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then go on 🍋 and do the same thing 🍊 [in] all ten of the game's areas. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this might not be fair to 🍋 compare this to a Super Nintendo game, 🍊 but if we look at this next to 🍋 (for example) "Soul Blazer" 🍊 it feels very repetitive and a little dull. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And remember, 🍋 "Soul Blazer" came out 🍊 [only] a year and a half 🍋 after "Crystalis". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, in this mountain level 🍋 we seem to have learned that 🍋 Draygonia is not just a person 🍊 but there's some sort of Draygonian 🍋 Empire, who's imprisoning people. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And you'll encounter 🍋 Draygonian soldiers more frequently 🍋 in the game, going forward, 🍊 though they don't appear to be 🍋 any smarter than regular monsters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Boss of this level 🍋 is General Kelbesque. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He seems to be, like, 🍋 an Earth elemental. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 He, uh, throws rocks at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are four evil wizards 🍋 in addition to the four good wizards 🍊 (and that's what geniuses 🍋 like me call parallelism). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Defeating him gives you 🍋 the Flame Bracelet, 🍊 which is what lets you power up 🍋 your Sword of Fire all the way. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you enter Waterfall Valley - 🍊 which looks a lot 🍋 like the first two areas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And in the first town 🍋 ya have to deal with a lot of 🍋 funny business from [the] Queen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you can go in and talk to her, 🍋 but she's not very interesting. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a Fortune Teller in town, 🍋 who tells ya to talk to the Queen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, because the guards 🍋 won't let you into a room, 🍊 you now need to go to Mount Sabre 🍋 and find yourself a Paralysis spell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Which you will then need 🍋 to come back to town [and] 🍊 use on the guard 🍋 who's guarding the Queen, 🍊 so he won't walk in front of 🍋 the door and block you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, the Queen is gone and 🍋 there's a cave with an underground 🍋 river behind the throne room. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And here's an example of a 🍋 game's logic really bugging me. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, you have Rabbit Boots, 🍋 which allow you to jump. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And in the last level you'd use 🍋 the boots to get past these ice slides. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And so, naturally, I figure, 🍊 'I'm gonna use the boots to cross 🍋 this narrow part of the river. Right?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The way the... the river gets, like, 🍋 conspicuously narrow, right here, 🍋 I mean, this must be a crossing point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it turns out it's not. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you go talk to 🍋 the Fortune Teller again, 🍊 she'll say (once again), 🍋 'Go talk to the Queen', 🍊 who now has returned 🍋 and mentions a cave. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, the cave she's talking about 🍋 is not the cave behind her room; 🍊 it's a cave behind a waterfall. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this whole section 🍋 is totally ridiculous, 🍊 as it mostly just involves you entering 🍋 and exiting the castle multiple times. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, of course, ya head on 🍋 out to the waterfall cave. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And in this cave you find 🍋 some people turned to stone - 🍊 and there's also Medusas 🍋 who will turn you into stone. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, here you do finally 🍋 find sword number three - 🍋 the Sword of Water. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, to do this you have to 🍋 go through all these steps. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, you can't directly 🍋 go into the waterfall cave, 🍊 because these guys are turned 🍋 to stone and will block your path 🍊 if you didn't obtain the Magic Flute 🍋 (or rather the Magic Ocarina, I guess) 🍋 that the Queen gives you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The whole thing feels like you need 🍋 to e... be either using a walkthrough 🍊 or just be a kid who is gonna 🍋 play this thing for, like, months - 🍊 trying to figure out 🍋 how to beat the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And that's kinda the problem 🍋 with this sort of game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As an adult, you just don't have 🍋 the patience for this kind of nonsense. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, yeah, this is [pretty] typical 🍋 of quite a lot of old N.E.S. games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, they don't all hold up the 🍋 same way that, like, "Super Mario ... 3" 🍊 or "Super Metroid" or 🍋 "Symphony of the Night" does. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Crystalis" is just so formulaic 🍋 and just doesn't have 🍋 enough good parts, I guess, 🍊 to make it worth your time, 🍋 in my opinion. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, after running into this guy, Rage - 🍋 protector of the... Lime Tree(?), 🍊 you get the power-up for the 🍋 Water Sword, which is very useful. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And also someone named Mesia 🍋 appears and then vanishes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so the Water Sword can 🍋 now freeze small streams of water. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if you go back to the cave 🍋 behind the Queen's chamber, 🍊 you can now cross this stream 🍋 and discover that the Queen 🍊 and the Fortune Teller 🍋 are actually the same person. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Whoa! I did not see 🍋 that one coming! Wow! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, she'll teach you magic spells 🍋 if you run some errands for her first. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On the way out, ya need to 🍋 give a healing item to a dolphin, 🍋 who will help you out later. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you need to go to another 🍋 cave and find some herb. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's a town full 🍋 of man-hating ladies, 🍊 and ya have to borrow this guy's boat, 🍋 so ya can sail out and fix the ocean. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The ocean is angry. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, all of this 🍋 means more dungeons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's always more 🍋 dungeons in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For me, "Crystalis" started getting 🍋 really annoying around this point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And we're not even halfway 🍋 through the game yet. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Around this time, 🍋 it seems like every other monster 🍋 can inflict status elements on you - 🍊 like Poison, Paralysis, Curse, 🍋 or even just turn ya into Stone. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, by now 🍋 you have the Recovery spell, 🍋 but that does use up Magic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, unlike in some J.R.P.G.s, 🍋 you can't just stock up on tons of 🍋 potions to restore Magic Points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I should probably also mention 🍋 the really weird menus and controls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the D-Pad, of course, 🍋 controls your character, 🍊 while the B Button 🍋 attacks with your weapon 🍊 and A typically casts whatever 🍋 magic spell you have equipped. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this makes sense. Right? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 B is your fire button; 🍋 A is your secondary button 🍊 (you know, typically to jump 🍋 in Action Games). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, that's how it works in 🍋 "Power Blade" or "Mega Man" 🍋 or whatever. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And when you have, like, 🍋 a menu, usually B is to select 🍋 and A is to go back, exit, etc. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, in "Crystalis", 🍋 in the equipment menu 🍊 (when your cursor is on 🍋 a weapon or an item) 🍊 pressing B does not select the item; 🍋 it drops the item. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A selects the item. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I swear - 🍋 the whole time I was playing this game, 🍋 I always mixed up the two buttons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, I intuitively felt the Start button 🍋 should return you back to the game... 🍊 when it actually takes you 🍋 to a screen where it shows you 🍋 what items the buttons are assigned to. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, ya know, my getting all these 🍋 buttons mixed up is not just me. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I did see videos of 🍋 people playing "Crystalis" 🍊 and they were always 🍋 doing the exact same thing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, speaking of which, 🍋 despite [only] having two action buttons, 🍊 you can have more than two usable 🍋 items equipped at the same time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, aside from a sword and magic, 🍋 you can also, at the same time, 🍋 equip a quest item (like a flute) 🍊 or special one-use items 🍋 (like Medicinal Herbs or the Rabbit Shoes). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you can have, like, 🍋 four usable items equipped at once 🍋 but you [only] have two buttons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, there were times 🍋 when I equipped an item, 🍊 assumed it was mapped to the A Button, 🍊 but then when I pressed the A Button 🍋 it actually cast a magic spell instead. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I never really mastered 🍋 the art of the equipment screens. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so anyway you 🍋 just keep plugging along. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's another mountain level; 🍊 but this time it's a hot mountain 🍋 instead of a cold mountain. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll find the last 🍋 of the four magic swords - 🍊 the Lightning Sword - 🍋 which has the most powerful attack. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You will also venture 🍋 into Draygonian territory 🍊 and are about to enter this 🍋 Draygonian palace (or whatever), 🍊 when the town where all the 🍋 good guys hang out gets attacked! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And you must then, uh, 🍋 fight Mado - a ninja-style dude 🍊 who can turn into a ball like Sonic 🍋 and fly around really fast. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, at this point, I was, like, 🍋 psychologically done with "Crystalis". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The last few areas, in particular, 🍋 are just an endless series of 🍋 giant maze-like dungeons, 🍊 made all the more annoying 🍋 by the fact that 🍊 virtually every enemy is immune 🍋 to damage from two or three elements 🍊 (which means you'll need to 🍋 switch swords to kill them). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, unless you've memorized 🍋 the property of every single 🍋 enemy in this game, 🍊 you will need to switch weapons 🍋 - often one or two times, 🍋 before finding the right sword. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I'll say: this particular issue 🍋 is the thing that virtually kills "Crystalis". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By Area 3 you'll be 🍋 encountering this constantly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A group of enemies come at you, 🍋 you hit them, and nothing [happens] 🍊 (or rather you hit them and they 🍋 make, like, a little 'ching' noise - 🍊 like you're hitting a... 🍋 a wall of metal or something). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, ya pause the game, 🍋 switch swords, and attack them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And if you wanna use 🍋 your powered-up attack, 🍊 you'll also need to switch 🍋 the Ball or Bracelet as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And when you come across 🍋 a destructible wall, 🍊 you'll need to switch weapons again, 🍋 because each type of destructible wall 🍊 can [only] be damaged 🍋 by one particular weapon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, let's just say that your Select Button 🍋 is going to get a serious workout, 🍋 if you're playing this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While there's never been 🍋 a sequel made to this, 🍊 "Crystalis" did get ported to 🍋 the Game Boy Color in 2000. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The intro is certainly more engaging 🍋 (and the story is more clear) 🍊 and overall the translation is better. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And while, generally speaking, 🍋 the Game Boy Color version is considered 🍋 to be inferior to the N.E.S. version, 🍊 the one big change they made was 🍊 they completely ditched the elemental 🍋 immunity for the monsters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, even SNK 🍋 realized how awful this was. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so the penultimate dungeon 🍋 is a four-story dungeon, 🍋 with a Boss on each level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And these are actually 🍋 Bosses you've all fought before - 🍊 just now they're 🍋 somewhat powered up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First one is General Kelbesque, 🍋 who seems to move faster than he used to 🍊 and shoots these green fireballs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And these, I guess, are... are probably 🍋 the toughest fights in the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, thankfully, one of the good wizards 🍋 is always gonna be in the next room 🍊 after each battle, so they can 🍋 refill your Health and Magic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Because without that, I mean, you 🍋 would never get through all four Bosses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so Sabera is next, 🍋 who shoots out these 🍋 room-filling projectiles at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The worst is almost certainly Mado, 🍋 who can still roll himself up into a ball - 🍊 but now he is just super fast 🍋 and just, like, flies across 🍋 the room like a pinball. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It is so annoying! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the last one is Karmine - who, 🍋 once again, throws projectiles everywhere 🍋 and moves around [pretty] quickly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And what makes these fights so tough 🍋 is the way the Boss's projectiles 🍊 will, like, fence you in 🍋 and limit your motion - 🍊 at the same time the Boss, himself, is 🍋 bearing down on you like a locomotive. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 All of these Bosses seem to move 🍋 [pretty] quickly - more quickly than you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you do get an important 🍋 power-up at the end of this area - 🍋 the 'Flight' spell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Flight' might be a bit inaccurate. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's more of a Hover spell - 🍊 but it does allow you to get into 🍋 previously [inaccessible] spots. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, yes (as a matter of fact) 🍋 you will have to backtrack 🍊 to earlier areas [of] the game, 🍋 in order to get important quest items. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, late in the game, ya get 🍋 something called Deo's Pendant 🍊 which is very useful, as it refills your M.P., 🍋 whenever you're standing still. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, you will find 🍋 the best armor and shields - 🍊 the Psycho Armor 🍋 and the Psycho Shield. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Psycho Armor 🍋 will slowly refill your Health - 🍊 so, between that and Deo's Pendant, 🍋 you can keep your Health and Magic 🍋 topped up before Boss fights. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the name refers back to 🍋 SNK's 1987 Arcade game, "Psycho Soldier", 🍊 in which you control two psychic teens, 🍋 Athena Asamiya and Sie Kensou. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And together they... (I don't know) 🍋 kill a lot of bad guys? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not really sure 🍋 what this game is about. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, the name Athena refers 🍋 back to SNK's earlier game, "Athena". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And both of these characters 🍋 (Athena and Sie Kensou) 🍊 appear in "Crystalis" 🍋 as two of the good wizards. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Nowadays, however, they are 🍋 mostly known as characters 🍊 in SNK's long-running 🍋 'King of the Fighter' series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so it turns out that, 🍋 despite nuclear war destroying 🍋 every building on the planet, 🍊 the Great Pyramid is actually still 🍋 standing and relatively unscathed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, it seems to have been 🍋 nicely renovated once you enter it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here you will fight 🍋 the big Boss, Emperor Draygon, 🍊 who is relatively easy, compared 🍋 to some of the earlier Bosses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I've run down a number of 🍋 reasons why I don't like this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I'll point out one last thing 🍋 - it's really damn long! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Looking at video 🍋 playthroughs online, 🍊 it seemed like this was gonna be 🍋 around a three-hour game, 🍊 but, in reality, 🍋 it felt more like 30 hours. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And one review that I read estimated 🍋 it as being around 25 hours. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So it's [pretty] damn long 🍋 for an N.E.S. Adventure Game 🍊 (and substantially longer than 🍋 "Soul Blazer" or "Ys: Book I & II"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Three hours is 🍋 practically a speedrun, 🍊 where ya know the exact most 🍋 efficient path through the game 🍊 and you never get lost in dungeons 🍋 and never accidentally fall into 🍊 one of the many, many pits 🍋 that litter the dungeons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As for myself, 🍋 I spent a substantial amount of time 🍊 walking through the many, many 🍋 identical-looking dungeon passageways 🍋 and getting completely lost. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I apologize for 🍋 making this segment so long 🍊 but "Crystalis" caused me 🍋 a great deal of misery 🍊 and I wanted to make sure 🍋 that you guys suffered a bit too. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, you have to enter the 🍋 back door for the great pyramid, 🍊 in order to get to 🍋 the pyramid's basement. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, oh yeah - 🍋 I forgot to mention this; 🍊 you need to have collected 🍋 two special bows 🍋 to get past this wall. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And I feel bad for anyone 🍋 who got to this point 🍊 but didn't get both bows, 🍋 which is quite possible 🍊 because you actually have to 🍋 go back to an earlier level 🍊 to get the Bow of the Sun, once 🍋 you've obtained the ability to fly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so now ya fight Draygon 🍋 again in his final form - a Dragon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Well, that's a surprise; 🍋 I mean, the guy is named 'Draygon'.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, you know, this guy 🍋 isn't actually very tough! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You just use your Level 3 🍋 lightning attack a few times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the thing about 🍋 these battles is that 🍊 your Magic [only] charges 🍋 when you're standing still. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, ya need to keep 🍋 holding down the charge button, 🍊 while moving around 🍋 and dodging his attacks 🍊 (occasionally stopping when it's safe, 🍋 so that you can continue 🍊 charging your attack, 🍋 'til it gets all led to Level 3). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, even then, it's still not over. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Remember the floating 🍋 tower from the intro 🍊 and that powerful computer 🍋 mentioned in the manual? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, your next step is to 🍋 teleport to that floating tower 🍊 and blow up the computer. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [I'm] still confused as to whether 🍋 the computer is good or evil. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, at this point, 🍋 I was having problems 🍊 which were probably caused by using a 🍋 cheat code to increase my Experience Points 🍊 (so, I could get to a high enough 🍋 level to beat the game, 🍊 without killing dozens and dozens 🍋 of additional monsters). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This somehow 🍋 caused my money 🍊 to hit, like, the maximum 🍋 amount of money possible, 🍊 which I assume messed up 🍋 something else in the game, 🍊 because I could not do any 🍋 damage to these enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And you have to kill 🍋 every single enemy on each floor, 🍊 in order to unlock 🍋 the entrance to the next floor. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, I was forced to 🍋 use an insta-kill cheat 🍊 in order to reach the top floor. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Normally, though, these guys 🍋 are actually super, super tough 🍊 and take, like, a dozen hits to kill, 🍋 you know, each single one. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then your four 🍋 swords merge together 🍊 into the more powerful 🍋 Crystalis Sword. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The computer then 🍋 goes all danmaku at you; 🍊 and you shoot him with your 🍋 charged up sword a few times. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The weird thing about "Crystalis" 🍋 is that, in theory, I like stuff like this, 🍊 but just everything 🍋 felt 'off', somehow. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It felt too long, too repetitive, 🍋 too many items to collect. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Giving the swords elemental properties 🍋 sounds kinda cool, 🍊 but it ends up feeling like a chore, 🍋 more than anything else. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of it might just be 🍋 the way that so many dungeons are, 🍊 like, so hard to navigate 🍋 because they all look the same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest IV" was a 🍋 game with tons [of] dungeons, 🍊 but they threw in some very creative 🍋 ideas for their dungeon designs 🍊 (like the giant bronze statue 🍊 or that big tree tha... that's 🍋 in, like, the elf village). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even a lot [of] parts of the overworld 🍋 in this game look very samey. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe a world map 🍋 woulda been a good idea(?) 🍊 (or a map in the manual?). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I feel like I spent a lot of time 🍋 just, kind of, wandering around 🍊 looking for something 🍋 but not really knowing what. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, there are worse 🍋 games in this episode 🍊 but none of them drove me just 🍋 batshit insane like "Crystalis" did. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Power Blazer 🇯🇵 // Power Blade 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April 20 🇯🇵 // 1991-03 [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Natsume | Taito
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We're going to 🍋 close this episode out 🍊 with another big one, here - 🍋 two games for the price of one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We're talking about 🍋 "Power Blazer", 🍊 released in Japan on April 20th 1990 🍋 (which is appropriate because 🍊 they must have been high as all hell 🍋 when they made this game). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the second game here 🍋 is "Power Blade" - 🍊 the heavily reworked 🍋 version of "Power Blazer" 🍋 released outside of Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This hit U.S. shelves 🍋 around March 1991. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure that most 🍋 people watching this 🍊 will be considerably 🍋 more familiar with "Power Blade" 🍋 than the original Japanese game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, at great personal cost 🍋 to my own sanity, 🍊 I have played all the way 🍋 through "Power Blazer" - 🍊 and (boy!) 🍋 I do not like this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Power Blazer" appears to be 🍋 Taito's attempt to create 🍋 a 'Mega Man'-style game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We have a very similar 🍋 Stage Select screen 🍊 that allows you to choose any 🍋 stage except for the final level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The levels themselves 🍋 are similar in style to 'Mega Man' 🍊 with lots of jumping 🍋 and climbing ladders. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each level has you 🍋 traveling from screen to screen 🍋 both horizontally and vertically. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And your character looks 🍋 a little bit like 'Mega Man', obviously. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yet absolutely everything 🍋 that made 'Mega Man' so great 🍋 is missing here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, good controls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Very tight controls are necessary 🍋 to make 'Mega Man' playable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Power Blazer"'s controls 🍋 are extremely finicky - 🍊 especially the jumping. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A number of the jumps 🍋 you have to make 🍊 have about 🍋 one pixel's worth of leeway. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have to be right on 🍋 the very edge of the platform 🍋 to guarantee you'll make it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And part of this could be 🍋 because I'm playing on an emulator 🍊 and there might be a slight delay, 🍊 but I recorded 'Mega Man' 1 and 2 🍋 on an emulator 🍊 and did not have these problems. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I feel like I've missed 🍋 more jumps in "Power Blazer" 🍊 than any other 🍋 N.E.S. game I've played. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, there's the ladders. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You must be positioned exactly 🍋 in the right spot to climb a ladder. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're not precisely 🍋 in the middle of the ladder, 🍊 you'll fail to grab the ladder 🍋 and just fall back down again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Needless to say, 🍋 both of these annoyances 🍊 (with both the jumping 🍋 and climbing ladders) 🍊 were fixed for 🍋 the U.S. version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here's the 🍋 worst part of this level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you fall in this part, you 🍋 will land on a series of platforms 🍋 with spikes between them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Going to the right 🍋 will get you another life; 🍊 going to the left will 🍋 allow you to get back up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But this section 🍋 just goes on and on, 🍊 like, literally platform after platform; 🍋 it's so tiresome. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are a lot of 🍋 genuinely unfair deaths in this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Check out these jet flames. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Did you see that? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The flame didn't come 🍋 anywhere near me! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Typically, you would expect to 🍋 have time to get out [of] the way 🍊 before the flame 🍋 actually touches you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, in "Power Blazer", 🍋 when the very first frame of 🍋 the fire appears, you will die. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And all of this nonsense 🍋 is just on this one level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yes, and also 🍋 it throws in an annoying bit 🍊 where we need to jump on 🍋 moving and vanishing blocks, 🍊 right before the door 🍋 to the Boss's room. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This Boss isn't too bad by itself; 🍊 you just need to avoid 🍋 his lightning bolts 🍊 and watch out for him when he 🍋 swoops down very quickly at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy is fast. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And if it's not clear 🍋 what's going on here, 🍊 you need to throw your Boomerang so 🍋 that he runs into it while he's diving. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You will then head back 🍋 to the Level Select screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can do these levels 🍋 in any order, 🍊 but this screen doesn't show you 🍋 which levels you've already completed 🍊 (which is just an... yet another of the 🍋 many, many annoyances in this game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This next level here 🍋 starts with windmills 🍊 and, of course, a series of platforms, 🍋 suspended over a floor lined with spikes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game absolutely loves its spikes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I should point out 🍋 your Boomerang weapon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's incredibly weak 🍋 and needs to recharge 🍊 for a second or 🍋 two after ya throw it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's virtually useless 🍋 against stronger enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It also has 🍋 very little range, initially; 🍊 but throughout the game 🍋 enemies will drop little power-ups 🍊 that will gradually 🍋 improve its range. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you might be wondering, 🍊 'Does this game have any 🍋 'Mega Man'-style special weapons?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the answer is no; 🍋 the Boomerang is it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That is what you 🍋 use for the entire game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Power Blazer" is [pretty] 🍋 nice looking in places. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This area here has, like, a 🍋 'Castlevania' Clock Tower vibe. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, regardless of how cool it looks 🍋 sometimes I could never really stop 🍊 hating this game for 🍋 more than a second. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Taito decided to 🍋 make some changes to this game 🍋 for the U.S. version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, they practically 🍋 rebuilt the game from scratch. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, the character 🍋 has been completely redesigned 🍊 and we now have an opening cutscene 🍋 which explains the plot. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, unlike in "Power Blazer", 🍊 you can't just waltz 🍋 into the Boss rooms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to find security cards 🍋 from your contacts in each level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This seems [pretty] similar to 🍋 Capcom's "Codename Viper" 🍋 from a few episodes ago. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though "Power Blade" 🍋 is a much better game 🍋 than "Codename Viper". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Level Select screen 🍋 has been redesigned 🍊 and it very nicely shows you 🍋 which areas you've already completed 🍊 (unlike "Power Blazer"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Upon starting up "Power Blade", 🍋 you will notice that you feel 🍋 much faster and more powerful. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can easily clear most jumps. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While the levels and "Power Blazer" 🍋 are relatively short and mostly linear, 🍊 in "Power Blade" each level 🍋 has been redesigned, 🍊 so that you need to 🍋 do some exploration. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, this level (Level 1 🍋 - the Space Shuttle level) 🍊 is the equivalent of the 🍋 far right level in "Power Blazer". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, 🍋 if we compare the two, 🍊 the backgrounds have all 🍋 been completely altered, 🍊 enemies have been changed; 🍊 it's virtually a 🍋 completely different game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You also get power-ups much 🍋 more quickly in "Power Blade". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your Boomerang will 🍋 become powerful enough 🍊 to take out large 🍋 enemies in a few hits; 🍊 you'll be able to shoot 🍋 multiple Boomerangs at once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, best of all, is the 🍋 Metal Suit or Power Suit 🍊 (the manual refers 🍋 to it by both names). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It turns you into 🍋 a total killing machine. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You lose this suit after 🍋 taking three hits from enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While the Bosses 🍋 are mostly the same, 🍊 the Boss fights are going to be 🍋 much trickier in "Power Blazer". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy can be a bit tough 🍋 because he's hard to hit in the air, 🍊 but sometimes you can 🍋 get your Boomerang 🍊 to hit his backside multiple times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the other hand, 🍊 in "Power Blade" this guy 🍋 goes down incredibly fast. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Newly added to "Power Blade" 🍋 are these little scenes 🍊 where you disarm the computer, 🍋 complete with a celebratory fist pump. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Power Blade"'s Level 2 borrows 🍋 a few things from the first level 🍊 that we played of "Power Blazer" 🍋 (like all this scaffolding). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Both levels have these faces 🍋 that vomit up bubbles at you - 🍊 as well as a Clock Tower-like series 🍋 of rooms full of gears and platforms - 🍊 as well as lots of 🍋 jets of flame to avoid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a water 🍋 theme here for a bit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Perhaps this is some kind 🍋 of hydroelectric plant? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This level's Boss 🍋 is a red dragon; 🍊 he rolls into a ball 🍋 and charges you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Power Blazer", you'll need to 🍋 perform a lot of carefully-timed jumps, 🍋 as he charges you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Power Blade" 🍋 you barely have to bother. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Section 3 is an underground level 🍊 with various computer rooms 🍋 and subterranean lakes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's very similar to its 🍋 "Power Blazer" equivalent, 🍋 in terms of graphics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though in "Power Blazer", 🍋 in addition to all the regular enemies, 🍊 there are blobs of green slime 🍋 that drip from the ceiling 🍋 and can harm you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as I've mentioned, 🍊 all the Boss fights in 🍋 "Power Blazer" are harder, 🍊 but this one is incredibly annoying 🍋 because it's so damn long. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to destroy 🍋 the four cells in the hive 🍊 that have, like, the 🍋 solid yellow orange color. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These four cells 🍋 constantly spit out bees at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just keep killing them 🍋 and eventually a cell will be empty. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Power Blade" 🍋 this is no problem. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 With your multiple Boomerangs, 🍋 you're a bee-killing fool. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This Boss fight took 🍋 around 30 seconds for me. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, in "Power Blazer", (man!) 🍋 there are a lot of bees 🍋 you need to kill! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It just goes on and on! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 🍋 There's a video play-through 🍋 online of "Power Blazer" 🍊 by some guy who's really good at it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this fight 🍋 took him almost five minutes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 That's ten times as long 🍊 as it took me to kill 🍋 the Boss in "Power Blade". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this particular guy finished 🍋 the entire game in 28 minutes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, this one Boss fight accounted for 🍋 almost one fifth of the entire playtime. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This particular part 🍋 (as well as the final Boss fight) 🍊 is just stupidly drawn out 🍋 and shows how poorly designed 🍊 some parts of "Power Blazer" 🍋 actually are. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Level 4 is the equivalent 🍋 to the first level we played 🍋 of "Power Blazer". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, comparing the two, 🍋 you can see how "...Blade"'s version 🍊 is more focused on fast-paced combat, 🍋 rather than hideous platforming. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We also get a cold section 🍋 in the "Power Blade" version; 🍊 there's no equivalent 🍋 to this in "Power Blazer". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By the way, I mentioned 🍋 you need to find a contact in each level 🍊 who gives you this ID card to 🍋 open the door to the Boss room. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya then typically 🍋 need to backtrack a bit 🍊 and find the path to 🍋 the end [of] the level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I wouldn't call "Power Blade" 🍋 a Metroidvania or anything like that, 🍊 but it does feel more 🍋 exploratory than "...Blazer". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Again, this Boss is 🍋 almost trivial in "Power Blade". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can simply attack him 🍋 directly while he's in the air 🍊 rather than forcing him to run 🍋 down into your Boomerang 🍋 as he dives at you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And that's one criticism 🍋 that can be leveled at "Power Blade" 🍊 - it's almost too easy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Much of the difficulty 🍋 of "Power Blazer" 🍊 is due to [only] being able to 🍋 shoot directly in front of you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Giving you a much more 🍋 powerful weapon that can fly further 🍊 and can be fired 🍋 upwards or diagonally 🍊 just completely 🍋 changes the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, don't get me wrong; 🍊 "Power Blade" is a 🍋 vastly superior game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I absolutely hated 🍋 playing through "Power Blazer". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just full of balance 🍋 issues and cheap deaths. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In Level 5, 🍋 you hop onto this ship 🍊 and make your way 🍋 through the ship's hold. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Power Blade" does add a few enemies 🍋 that provide some complications, 🍊 like these little mobile bombs 🍋 that fall from the ceiling 🍊 and come running really fast. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The equivalent stage in 🍋 "Power Blazer" is very different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] begins in a 🍋 very different fashion 🍊 as you jump through a long 🍋 procession of jeeps and tanks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this appears to be, 🍋 sort of, like, the unofficial 🍋 first level of "Power Blazer". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The levels aren't numbered, 🍋 like they are in "Power Blade". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, when the Level Select 🍋 screen first loads up, 🍋 when you start a new game, 🍊 you are positioned 🍋 on this level by default. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If this was, in fact, 🍋 intended as the first level to play, 🍊 this is a [pretty] weird way 🍋 to start a game, 🍊 because this level is just 🍋 obnoxious as all hell. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another of the many, many 🍋 gripes I have about "Power Blazer", 🍊 there's no indication 🍋 when Bosses take damage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They don't blink 🍋 or anything when hit, 🍊 so it's not obvious that you're 🍋 using the correct technique 🍋 to defeat the Boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Power Blade" the Bosses 🍋 have a visible Health Meter, 🍊 but in "...Blazer" you're not really sure 🍋 if you're actually hitting their weak spot 🍋 or not, until they finally die. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Area 6 and "Power Blade" is sort of 🍋 a strange sewer underground level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It feels a little shorter 🍋 and more straightforward 🍋 than some of the other levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Meanwhile, the "Power Blazer" 🍋 version is... New York City(?). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll enter some sewers 🍋 and then fight Frankenstein. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Perhaps the Frankenstein monster 🍋 was a bit too goofy, 🍊 because they swapped out 'Frank' 🍋 for this giant robot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's actually a little bit tougher 🍋 when you have the Metal Armor, 🍋 because he's harder to hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 With the Boomerangs, 🍋 you can just hit him 🍋 right in the head. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've beaten 🍋 all six sectors, 🍊 you can move on to 🍋 the Master Computer area. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The actual plot here 🍋 is that alien terrorists have 🍊 disrupted the Master Computer 🍋 and you've got to reboot it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I think all the enemies in the game 🍊 are supposed to be like malfunctioning 🍋 security robots and stuff like that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It doesn't look like 🍋 you're actually fighting 🍋 any... any actual aliens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Master Computer 🍋 wishes you luck. 🍊 (How nice of him!) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this level is sort of a 🍋 generic computer-based design. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, in "Power Blazer" 🍊 this starts you off like you're 🍋 in the Castlevania hallway. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, I'll point out, while... that 🍊 "Power Blazer" does lack the cool 🍋 multiple Boomerang power-up 🍋 or the Metal Armor, 🍊 your wimpy little weapon will eventually 🍋 be able to go through enemies 🍊 and damage 🍋 multiple enemies at once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Boomerang will be 🍋 red when powered up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, enemies will sometimes drop 🍋 a power-up, shaped like the letter 'N', 🍊 which actually powers down 🍋 the Boomerang to regular form. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's quite easy to catch 🍋 an 'N' power-up by accident 🍊 when killing an enemy 🍋 that's really close to you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And also I... I can't recall 🍋 seeing this happen in any other games 🍊 but enemy drops in "Power Blazer" 🍋 (like Health and power-ups) 🍊 can get stuck in a wall or a ceiling, 🍋 where you can't grab them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This actually happens 🍋 a lot in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and one last 🍋 total asshole move 🍊 before the Final Boss - 🍋 there are surprise falling platforms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the Final Boss is a, 🍋 sort of, a two-part Boss; 🍊 first up is his floating head. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's not that bad; 🍊 you just need to move out 🍋 from underneath him 🍊 (to get out of his way of his projectiles), 🍋 then jump up and shoot him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's not really tough but, 🍋 once again, "Power Blazer" 🍋 gives you no indication 🍊 that you're actually 🍋 doing damage to him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I had to use a Health Refill here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Both "...Blazer" and "...Blade" 🍋 have these Refills that you can 🍊 stock up on an... and 🍋 then use, when necessary. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After defeating him, 🍋 the second Final Boss appears 🍊 and it's a... 🍋 Bubble Machine(!?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to shoot the exposed core, 🍋 while jumping over the bubbles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like the beehive Boss, 🍋 this one goes on way too long - 🍊 about two minutes of 🍋 constantly shooting at it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As a reward, 🍋 you get this little scene here 🍊 where you get to 🍋 look out over the city. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Power Blade", on the other hand, 🍋 dispenses with the falling blocks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, the first Boss is exactly 🍋 the same as "Power Blazer"'s. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, the bubble machine is 🍋 replaced by this floating CPU thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you need to 🍋 shoot its exposed core, 🍊 while dodging fireballs 🍋 that are falling from the ceiling. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're feeling really bold, 🍋 you can stand right below it 🍊 and just unload your weapon 🍋 into its guts. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 No, thank you, Nova! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing "Power Blade" 🍋 didn't improve on 🍊 was "Power Blazer"'s 🍋 very silly credits sequence. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Honestly, it was 🍋 [pretty] cool of Taito 🍊 to take an almost unplayable 🍋 game like "Power Blazer" 🍊 and polish it into a really 🍋 fun game like "Power Blade". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And yeah maybe your weapon 🍋 is just a little too overpowered 🍊 (especially with the Metal Armor) 🍋 but I can't complain too much. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, not every N.E.S. game 🍋 has to be "Ninja Gaiden". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There is a harder difficulty setting 🍋 which gives you a shorter timer 🍊 and enemies knock you backwards 🍋 when they hit you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if you've mastered the regular mode 🍋 and want a bit more of a challenge, 🍋 you can play that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, regardless of any 🍋 reservations about "Power Blade", 🍊 it is a... still a [pretty] radical 🍋 Action Platformer from Taito. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 SD Battle Oozumou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April 20 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?]
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Banpresto 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Finally! 🍋 Our last game this episode! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The appearance of the 🍋 loathsome domino-masked logo 🍊 lets us know that we're going to be 🍋 looking at a game from Banpresto - 🍊 the Japanese toy 🍋 video game company. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were previously 🍋 known as Coreland, 🍊 until Bandai purchased an 🍋 interest in the company 🍊 and it was renamed Banpresto. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is their 🍋 first Famicom game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As the name 🍋 "SD Battle Oozumou" suggests, 🍊 this game combines two of 🍋 Japan's cultural traditions - 🍊 Sumo Wrestling and grotesquely short 🍋 versions of licensed characters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if you like TV show robots, 🍋 this game provides a dazzling array 🍊 of intellectual properties 🍋 from various companies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You've got your Ultramans, 🍋 your Gundams (I think), 🍊 your Kamen Riders 🍋 (who are dudes who ride motorcycles 🍋 but dress like bugs, for some reason). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also this superhero dude 🍋 who looks like he's a Banpresto mascot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess I'll go with 🍋 one of the bug guys. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, in terms of Wrestling or 🍋 Sumo Games, this is [pretty] basic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have a very limited 🍋 number of moves (like five or so). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can shove your opponent, 🍋 you can lift him up, 🍊 you can throw him a little bit... 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character has 🍋 some sort of Health Bar 🍊 which gets depleted 🍋 if you get hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When it gets low 🍋 (like about four bars or so) 🍊 you can get 🍋 knocked out of the ring. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, once you 🍋 get the hang of it, 🍊 taking out your opponents 🍋 is [pretty] simple! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just keep slapping them 🍋 and pushing them, 🍊 wearing down their health until 🍋 you can knock them out of the ring. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is very much literally 🍋 a button-mashing game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, unlike most 🍋 Wrestling Games we've seen, 🍊 characters do not have 🍋 any, like, individual stats 🍊 or any kind of special moves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, your opponents 🍋 don't get any more difficult 🍊 as the game progresses. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if... if you play 🍋 the single-player mode, 🍊 you can technically beat the game 🍋 (just like in most Fighting Games). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The various venues change, 🍋 as you make progress 🍋 throughout the game; 🍊 however you might be wondering, 🍋 'I mean, just how long is the 🍋 actual single-player game?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I looked up a longplay video 🍋 that beat the game for one character, 🍋 in a little over 30 minutes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each match is around 🍋 a minute at the very most 🍊 which would add up to 🍋 quite a few matches. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, on the surface, this looks like 🍋 a completely unmemorable game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, sometimes when we 🍋 start digging a little deeper 🍊 we uncover dark secrets. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Soon we realize that 🍋 what we're looking at is 🍋 just the tip of the iceberg. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And what lies below the surface 🍋 can drive a man to madness. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "SD Battle Oozumou" unleashed 🍋 a veritable orgy of kusoge 🍊 that would last for decades - a series 🍋 known as 'the 'Compati Heroes''. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game had its origins 🍋 in a toy manufacturer named Popy - 🍊 one of the first companies 🍋 known for producing high-quality toys, 🍋 based on Sci-Fi cartoons and TV shows. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Popy obtained the licenses 🍋 to make toys based on, uh, 🍊 'Mazinger Z', 'Kamen Rider', 🍋 and various other properties. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Popy went under, 🍋 for various reasons, 🍊 and was absorbed into Bandai, 🍋 who, of course, already had 🍊 the merchandising rights for 🍋 'Ultraman' and other similar products. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, I guess someone decided, 🍊 'Why not just cram all this stuff 🍋 together into one crossover game?'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "SD Battle Oozumou" is a [pretty] 🍋 unambitious start to the series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But Banpresto would 🍋 follow it up with a second game 🍊 a mere two and a half months later 🍋 and then keep pumping these things out 🍋 non-stop over the next 30 years. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, the most recent game, 🍋 "Super Robot Wars 30", 🍊 will be released around the same 🍋 time as this episode comes out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The sheer number of these things 🍋 that they made is overwhelming! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's multiple sub-series 🍋 that exist inside the main series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, the 'Great Battle' 🍋 series which premiered in 1991. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or "Super Robot Wars" - 🍋 a Tactical R.P.G. series - 🍊 which is probably going to be the 🍋 most familiar name among Westerners 🍊 and definitely the most active branch 🍋 of 'Compati Heroes', at the moment. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if Tactical R.P.G.s is not your bag, 🍋 there's all kinds of stuff - 🍊 like good old-fashioned 🍋 Dungeon Crawler R.P.G.s 🍋 (such as the "Lost Souls" game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're more into Sports Games, 🍊 then there are Baseball Games, Soccer Games, 🍋 and yes even Dodgeball Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Heck! They even made 🍋 a Pinball Game about 🍋 giant robots fighting each other! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, 🍋 there are Pachinko Games! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, as you can imagine, 🍋 they also made 'Compati Heroes' 🍋 manga and anime products. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Virtually every console since 1990 🍋 received one of these games 🍋 - even the Sega Pico! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know how many 🍋 'Compati Heroes' games there are, 🍋 but, I mean, it's well over 40! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Basically, it's like the '...Mario Bros.' 🍋 series, except that it's crap. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, I think I've had enough 🍋 of awful games for today, 🍊 so let's wrap this up. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 59 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, assuming 🍋 anyone is still awake 🍊 (or just hasn't died of old age), 🍊 let's pick the Best and 🍋 Worst Games this episode. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Best is a [pretty] easy choice: 🍋 "Power Blade" 🍊 (not "Power Blazer", of course, 🍋 but "Power Blade"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not the most 🍋 challenging N.E.S. game, 🍊 but after "Ninja Gaiden II..." 🍊 it just feels like a 🍋 breath of fresh air. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Worst Game: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, "Crystalis" is certainly the 🍋 game that tormented me the most. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was like a bad steak 🍊 (you know, the more of it 🍋 you eat, the bigger it gets). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, I'm gonna 🍋 have to hand the award 🍋 to "SD Battle Oozumou". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not [only] is it a terrible game 🍋 but it begat the entire 🍋 'Compati Heroes' series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's basically patient zero for a 🍋 whole epidemic of kusoge games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next month we'll have 🍋 some really big games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, to avoid the same 🍋 bottleneck we saw this episode, 🍊 I am taking the unprecedented step 🍋 to push back one game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Snake's Revenge" will actually 🍋 be covered in "...Episode 61". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I can justify this 🍋 because "Snake's Revenge" 🍊 is a U.S. game which doesn't 🍋 have an actual release date. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, Nintendo 🍋 officially says April [1990]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But who knows? 🍊 Maybe it came out in 🍋 March, maybe in May. 🍇🍌
