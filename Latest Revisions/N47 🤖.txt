👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 47 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Whoa! Finally! The new episode of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I bet you thought this is never going to happen, ye of little faith. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But here it is. Dr. Sparkle in the house again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Dr. Sparkle all up in your spouse again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, that's right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What do you think your wife is doing while you're watching these things? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why do you think each episode is like an hour and a half long? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, anyway, last episode we left off in July 1989. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We're gonna finish up July and move on to August. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But before we do that, let me point out something about August. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was a huge month for video games in the U.S. because three new gaming platforms launched in August 1989. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo released the Game Boy in America. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It had been available in Japan since April. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, Sega finally introduced the Mega Drive over here on August 14, calling it, of course, the Sega Genesis. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And N.E.C. produced the American version of the P.C. Engine known as the TurboGrafx-16. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That was on August 19. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll discuss these launches more in the 'Chronsega' and 'Chronturbo' series. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But think about it, the U.S. got its first major handheld gaming system, and then the same month, its first 16-bit console. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Prior to this, there were [only] two, sort of, uh, modern gaming systems (the N.E.S. and the Master System). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then suddenly, all of a sudden, there were five. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (I don't really count the Atari 7800 because it was a budget system and wasn't really in c... -- competing with Nintendo and Sega.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And to get an idea of how fast things are moving in the U.S. in the video game world, remember that the N.E.S. didn't even really become a hot commodity until Christmas 1986. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By the end of '86, it [only] sold about a million units. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And just two and a half years later, the next generation of consoles had already arrived. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then a couple more months later Atari would debut their high-end handheld the Lynx, so six consoles were available to U.S. consumers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, you know, the next few years will, sort of, usher in, like, a Golden age of gaming. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And we will be here watching it unfold. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Right now, however, we'll return back to July 1989 and we'll start with a few U.S.-[only] games.🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Defender of the Crown 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Cinemaware 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Ultra Games 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's get this rather infamous cart out of the way first. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 From Ultra Games (that is Konami's U.S.-[only] overflow label) we have "Defender of the Crown" - a very odd, sort of, Military Strategy Game, which takes place in 12th century England.🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You start by choosing a character, each with its own unique combination of stats in three categories: Leadership, Jousting, and Swordplay. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Leadership is probably the most useful skill, as it, sort of, controls how well you do in battles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, it turns out you're good buddies with Robin Hood. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And throughout the game, you can take your army into Sherwood Forest and he will assist you in your battles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Turns out the King was assassinated in the crown stolen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You are to 'defend the crown' (which, in this context, apparently means kill off the rest of the country's nobility and then seize the crown). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, shouldn't there be some sort of relative of the King, next in line? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But hey, if you decide to take control of the country via a violent military overthrow, and you actually win, then I guess you can call what you did 'defending the crown' if you want. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So "Defender of the Crown" roughly resembles a much simpler version of games like "The Three Kingdoms". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was also, uh, probably inspired by Sid Meier's, uh, "Pirates", which in its own, sort of, way combines Strategy and Action. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... But it's actually much simpler than any of those other games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no dealing with the taxes, or alliances, or spies, or marriages, or any of that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, "Defender..." is, sort of, boiled down into three very simple but somewhat frustrating minigames. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can attack enemies, raid their castles, or host tournaments. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So here I decided to raid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All that really goes into this is, uh, getting a bit of extra Gold, which is used solely to buy army units. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, every single raid is exactly the same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You appear on this screen and swordfight three guards and then inside the castle you find a stronger guard. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The End. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Sword fighting is [pretty] simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just press the button to extend your sword. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And all you really, sort of, do is, sort of, stick out your sword when a guard gets close to you and then step back so he can't attack you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you stick out your sword again, et cetera. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not, uh, really that difficult. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It doesn't require any particular skill or quick reflexes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But it is tedious, and slow, and the controllers are very clunky, and the characters are poorly animated, and it's just no damn fun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, you don't really have to do this if you don't want to. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another minigame is Jousting. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At any point you can hold a tournament. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This requires you to defeat three opponents. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Jousting is probably the part that people hate the most, since it involves trying to hit the other guy's shield with your spear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, you can't really control your spear and it, sort of, moves around randomly all over the place while you're approaching the guy.🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now regardless of whether you knock your opponent off the horse or not, you'll then need to fight him with maces, which is quite often, uh, very easy, and you'll almost probably never lose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So winning a tournament will actually bump up your leadership stat a little bit, which will help you when you fight in battles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or you could just pick a character with strong leadership and skip the tournaments altogether. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now the way to actually win the game is to use your money to buy troops and then march over to a neighbor's castle and kill everyone. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Buying and moving your army is done by navigating the, sort of, badly-designed menu. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, use the A button to select a menu option or to decide where you want to move your army to. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And you might think that, 'Hey, if I made a mistake; I want to go back to the prior menu.' you might hit B. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, no. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You move the cursor to the little menu box and then hit A again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Attacking involves the third minigame, in which you use a catapult to break down the castle walls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just a matter of releasing the A button at the correct moment. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You can also throw in, uh, disease bombs and quote unquote "Greek Fire" (which I'm [pretty] sure they did not have in England in the Middle Ages). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This kills off some of the defenders inside the castle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And after six catapult throws an automated battle starts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are tactics you can select on the right of the screen, and I guess these slightly alter the probabilities, but it kind of boils down to whoever has the most troops wins. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now to win the game, I guess you need to simply capture all five castles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, on the face of this defender looks [pretty] dull, but it actually was a highly Acclaimed game at the time (at least in its original incarnation). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It came out in 1986 on the Commodore Amiga computer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, it was, sort of, like the killer app for the Amiga - one of the first games to really show off the computer's graphics and sound. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was the first time by a company called Cinemaware and, as the name suggests, the idea was to create, sort of, an immersive cinematic experience through dazzling visuals and sound. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now this wowed critics and Cinemaware seems, sort of, uh, destined for greatness. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was, sort of, like the, uh, mid-'80s version of those big budget games, today, that're all cutscenes and Quick Time Events. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But it seems like a very shallow game wrapped a [pretty] package. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But still, it was a big enough hit to get an N.E.S. port. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And while this doesn't look nearly as good as the original, um, all the illustrations are basically 8-bit copies of the original drawings. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there's a little more to it to what we've seen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At one point, you also get a request to rescue the Princess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is exactly the same as the castle-raiding sequences; you do the whole sword fight things again, except at the end, you get an extra screen with some text, and a picture of the Princess, who probably has the most cleavage of any character in an N.E.S. game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Western-developed N.E.S. games seemed to put a lot more sexy stuff in their games than Japanese developers did. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a lot more half-naked women. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After being rescued, the Princess will join forces with you, which increases the amount of Gold you get each turn. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also sometimes enemies will attack your castle, and then you get this minigame which I originally did not understand at all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The manual is no help whatsoever. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As it explain how the game converts the numbers of people in your garrison into crossbowmen and how your stats influence how powerful the crossbowmen are. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But it doesn't tell you what the controls do or give you the slightest idea of what's going on, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It just looks like you're shooting at the enemies with crossbows, but the bolts never actually seem to reach the enemy troops. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So I would always die very quickly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it turns out there's actually three somewhat subtle height levels, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you need to press the Up or Down button to move to the correct one in order to kill an enemy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as a matter of fact, I have no idea how to actually beat this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In theory to just buy some units, march to the nearby castle, attack, and repeat. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the actual minigames, as I mentioned, are not that hard. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I saw some videos of the game that show it can be defeated in about 15 minutes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I even found a walkthrough which gives you a foolproof turn-by-turn guide that basically gives you instructions for easily defeating the game, though I couldn't even get past the third turn. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd spend all my Gold on troops, move one step out of my castle, and then immediately get attacked by a much larger enemy force. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And whenever I could conquer a castle, a fresh army would immediately appear and attack. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By Turn 3 or 4, other armies would have filled up every single space on the map with troops. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So there's clearly some deeper strategy, here, I don't understand. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But I still don't like the philosophy behind the game design. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It does just feel to me like a series of simple and poorly constructed minigames, stitched together with some cutscenes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The whole idea for, like, sticking a few minigames together is something we've seen before in other Western games like the Activision "Ghostbusters" or the Epyx "California Games", "Winter Games", and so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And while I'm sure "Defender of the Crown" has its fans, I've personally found very little interesting going on here.🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Cobra Triangle 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Great, great, great. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Another game from Rare. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This artwork looks just so British! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the sparkly logo is like a typical Rare touch. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Rare's been [pretty] busy cranking out Nintendo games and "Cobra Triangle" is the third game release for Nintendo of America, after "Slalom" and "R.C. Pro-Am", because (unlike Nintendo of Japan) Nintendo of America didn't really have an internal game development division. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Cobra Triangle" is [pretty] similar to "R.C. Pro-Am". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At least at first glance, it looks like "R.C. Pro-Am" on water. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But there's actually a bit more to "Cobra Triangle" than that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like "R.C. Pro-Am", it's divided into a series of tracks or levels (some of which involve, uh, crossing a finish line within a certain time limit). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Others require you to perform some sort of particular task and sometimes you just need to survive the obstacles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Cobra Triangle" uses a "Gradius"-like power-up system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh, you -- Collecting power-ups will allow you to upgrade your 'Turbo' (which is a one time acceleration upgrade) also your 'Speed' or your Weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's something called 'Force' which refills your health and gives you a bit of invulnerability. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This level, right here, is all about collecting power-ups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually vital that you do well here; otherwise, you're gonna be underpowered for the rest of the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I'm not doing that well, because this boat is spazzy as hell. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's a classic video gamey challenge: protect the people from being carried away. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The instruction manual does not give you even the slightest hint of plot and so we really have no idea why everyone hates you and is trying to kill you or want to try and kidnap these people. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And what does the name 'Cobra Triangle' even mean? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I have] no idea. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Typical Rare - sort of, nonsense title (just like, uh, "Sabre Wulf"). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And "Cobra Triangle" has boss fights! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I have no idea what the connection is between the boats who are trying to kill you and the giant sea monster but here we go; you gotta kill the sea monster. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Having your weapons Leveled Up will make this fight really easy! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And if your boat can fly, then why the hell do you keep going through all this hassle of driving around on the water? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, why risk your life dodging logs on a river when you can just, like, fly over all that stuff? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Cobra Triangle" is notorious for being a hard game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it is not necessarily "Battletoads"-hard but later levels get near-impossible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And your little jet-powered runabout handles in a [pretty] finicky fashion. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it will take you a lot of practice to master the controls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'jump the waterfall' level is actually, sort of, like the ancestor to that 'Turbo Tunnel' level in "Battletoads". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you have a 'Power' meter but many of the collisions take off, like, a huge chunk of the meter! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you can have a lot of health left and still get one-hit deaths. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The music by, uh, David Wise is, uh, decent, um, but after "Chronturbo ... 4" I'm actually a little bit spoiled when it comes to game music. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Cobra Triangle"'s sorta the game that you, as a kid, you may have played, like, obsessively (you know, over and over again, even though you keep getting killed). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But you know, honestly nowadays, I guess I might have to say I just don't have time for this sorta crap. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Thundercade 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Seta | Micronics 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sammy 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, new publisher alert. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Thundercade" is the first NGS game published by American Sammy (Sammy being, of course, the Pachinko company who later devoured Sega). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As far as I know, American Standard was a publisher [only] and the stuff they put out was just weird random games by different developers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Man nice music, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object is to infiltrate a terrorist base and destroy their nuclear power plant. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently whatever watchdog group that is supposed to keeping an eye on nuclear proliferation has really been sleeping on the job. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, the terrorist group seems to have grown into like a full fledged army. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, these guys have their own nuclear power plant; that's not really just a regular old terrorist group. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, everything's okay because they gave you a motorcycle so you can get -- go down there and single handedly take these guys down (which is I guess one better than what they gave the guys and "Commando" and "Ikari Warriors", which was nothing). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, you'll be thinking, 'Holy crap, this looks like the typical Japanese because so Bay from 86 or '87'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, the entire background is one color. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This all looks so sloppy and amateurish; what's going on? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, guys, I am pleased to tell you that this is another game by our good old buddies. Micronics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, the same guy is behind so many awful games like the courts with Nina "1942". And they were just titles such as "Super Pitfall", well, they are back. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was originally an Arcade Game from 1987 published by Taito. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though Game Developer Research Institute indicates that a company called Elmer was involved. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It certainly wasn't the prettiest game by 1987 standards, but it does handle and looks a hell of a lot better than the home version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, here's the first boss: a submarine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, seriously, the terrorists have a submarine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, you might go hey, you know I'm completely wailing on this dude, but I can't even tell them doing any damage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And eventually a guy will just give up and drive away. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, that seems [pretty] stupid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what's what's going on here? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Thundercade" relies heavily on destructible background objects and hidden power-ups. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your standard power-ups are just side cars, which had a bit more firepower. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this guy here the hidden volken power-up is the key to kicking some serious hiney. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah. How you like me now guys. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mr. Submarine. Not so tough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You do need to be careful because one hit will cause you to lose. Vulcan or touching another powerful swap out the Balkan for something inferior. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most to ground and these are not too hard to avoid but these flying dudes will occasionally appear and drop a bomb right on your head. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What exactly are these things supposed to be? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The fact that they're flesh colored makes them look like flying guys and Bumblebee costumes, but the manual claims they are choppers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are a few ways of them, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Their objective seems to be to make sure that you have no power-ups when you get to the boss fight at this level right after the bridge. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, you do have bombs to use and far and away the best thing about "Thundercade" is the fact that when you use the bomb, an actual bomber flies overhead and does a little bombing run. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, there is a lot of luck involved when it comes to how effective the bomber is going to be. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes it knocks out several enemy's guns; other times it will knock out any. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Look how awful The animation is on this boss; this is really [pretty] terrible looking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Between levels to get bonus levels I'm gonna try to catch power-ups, bombs and extra lives. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One power is the missiles which are actually [pretty] cool. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, all together there are four levels; the final boss is the nuclear reactor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first part of level four has what must be the laziest video game background ever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This last part is extremely hard, and the final boss has tons of guys shooting at you, and they're [pretty] resilient to bombs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But as much as I hate this game, I will show you the fantastic ending. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, dude, you just blew up a nuclear reactor that's like 20 feet away from you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You would be dead from radiation poisoning within the day. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you know, you are one tough soldier. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway "Thundercade" - yeah, it's [pretty] horrible. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Strider 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, there was nothing wrong with "Defender of the Crown" or a "Cobra Triangle". But here is the most interesting of our U.S.-[only] gamestate. "Strider" Capcom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's and.'s was never-released in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And "Strider" isn't some piece of quickie shovelware that Capcom dumped over here; it's actually a top tier action title (though it does definitely have some problems). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But just look at how cool this intro is! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is it snowing in space? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Strider" is an Action Adventure type game with elements of "Metroid"-style backtracking and exploration. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's definitely in the same vein as "Bionic Commando". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hell, both games have this very similar, sort of, giant computer thing where you get communications from the command center. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It starts with either security or ordering record captured comrade instead of rescuing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This should honestly send up a big red flag as your boss his true intentions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even transfer down to earth from your station. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, initially, you can [only] had the one location but you gain access to more areas as the game progresses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, if you're watching 'Chrontendo', the odds are [pretty] good that you're familiar with "Strider" the Arcade Game, which was released in 1989. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade "Strider" is well-loved to this day as being one of the greatest Capcom Arcade Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's, sort of, the apotheosis of Capcom's 1980 side-scrolling Action Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the Nintendo Entertainment System "Strider" is not an adaptation of the Arcade Game; it's more of a sequel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like Tecmo's "Ninja Gaiden", the two games were built separately. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in fact, they're actually both part of this multimedia "Strider" project Capcom plan, a collaboration with the Hmong the company called moto Mia Kaku. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The folks that comprise Mona Mia created the character and then Bruce to "Strider" manga. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Two games arose from this Capcom multimedia collaboration (the other one being the game that was released in the U.S. as "Destiny of an Emperor". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was released in May 1989. And we cover that game a few episodes. Go). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's odd. This never received a Japanese release, especially since they produce the companion manga. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But recently, a prototype appeared for sale and it showed a 1988 copyright date. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As to why this number came out, no one seems to know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The N.E.S. "Strider" starts off looking somewhat like an 8-bit version of the original. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have the similar slashing sort attack and you jump around on platforms and girders and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also all these pneumatic tube things moving around from area to area. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Data discs are found throughout the game, which you then want to plug into that big computer on your spaceship. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when you do you get some information that moves the plot forward. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The level design here is a lot like buying a "Commando". Lots of running around in quarters and moving your way up or down vertical passageways. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Encountered various dead ends like this one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to come back here later once you've gained some additional abilities. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In most levels, you will find either data discs which are literally old-fashioned floppy disks, but gigantic or you'll find some sort of ability up Great. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here I brought the floppies back and they gave me a clue to travel to Egypt. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the first part of this level is [pretty] cool. You travel along the moving train. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once the train stops, you'll find yourself at (naturally) the pyramids. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is actually the first of two appearances The Great Pyramids making this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you'll recall we also turn up recently in on Sega in that wonderful game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently in video games, it's impossible to use an addiction setting without the pyramids. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, it's brighter isn't nearly as flexible as via "Commando" was when it comes to finding ways to move around to the levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After all by a "Commando" you have that crazy robot arm. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In "Strider" you're limited at this point to jumping and a sliding window as you squeezed through tight spaces. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, you do have another move, a double wall jump called the triangle jump. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The manual makes it quite simple jump once and then we hit the wall jump again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In reality, however, let's just say that some games have one particular moment that almost breaks the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know that one part where you say 'I was enjoying myself Until this came along.'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's that one moment of utter bullshit that makes you simply want to stop playing the game forever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In "Strider", that moment is, right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to perform the triangle jump twice in this narrow vertical shaft. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the jumping in "Strider" is not real smooth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it kind of sucks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Usually, if you miss a jump, just make yourself up and try it again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually, I was able to successfully complete a triangle jump at earlier points in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But here's something about the narrowness of the shaft makes it almost impossible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can pull it off maybe 120 times and the second jump in the air is even harder. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, the odds are it'll take me a good 400 tries to actually get to the top of that chap. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess this is what passwords are for. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Any who eventually find your kidnapped fellow "Strider" and rescue him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And eventual learn about some sort of dreadful secret weapon called the same which is some kind of super brainwashing device. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It actually causes your own buddy to turn on. You. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Strider" has some basic R.P.G. elements (like, for example, you technically have a level) as well as "Metroid" "Castlevania"-style limit use weapons called tricks for some stupid reason. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, to change the trick, you actually have to go into the menu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is kind of annoying because you often have to turn them on or off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A number of enemies here seem to be designed to be killed using a certain specific correct. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Every country you visit will result in you getting a new data disc or talking to someone who spill some vile information. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then head back to your ship and pop in the data disc whatever. And then the plot advances. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here. It turns out your boss is a traitor and, sort of, behind the whole main project or delete to working for it somehow. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned earlier, aside from those disc, we get these very basic ability upgrades, like the ability to be able to walk up certain walls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also you'll find keys to open certain locked doors, so you can go back and then access to areas. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But as far as the Metroidvania style elements go, they were [pretty] light. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's not really much fun exploration of this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The environments are [pretty] repetitive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, The Great Wall of China doesn't always seem that different than the pyramid. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You go to Africa, those countries named. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this, sort of, features a forest level where these white skinned natives hang upside down from trees and shoot the low gun darts at you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember, the one part I love is, right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, you should not be so arrogant. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's in denial. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you get another Damn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of those cane devices. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're sort of like bosses, though they're actually super easy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A bit harder are the, sort of, mini-Bosses that appear in the final level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These guys actually have some challenging attack patterns that take a bit of effort to kill. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, I have finally reached the games in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I need to destroy the cane devices and take care of the crater matter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll turn you into the rest of my cipher. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You definitely cannot accuse "Strider" of not having a rather awkward translation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy's a bit of a pain because he seemingly can't be damaged. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I can imagine kids throwing their game pads at the wall and frustration. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't recall getting any hints as to how to beat this guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it turns out very simple all you have to charge your weapon, which disarms him and then you can easily kill him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It feels a little cheap. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And using the chargeability isn't the, sort of, thing that would actually, sort of, pop into your head based on previous boss battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I'll go out on a limb and say boss battles arc "Strider" strong point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is you Desa roll, which I guess is a really bad misreading of the anchor sell that big ass tree from Norse mythology. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's, sort of, like a souped up version of the other cane creatures. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Doesn't really seem that hard, but the first time I taught him this habit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Video game should ban this from happening, where you kill the boss and then you would die from a stray projectile a second afterwards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's another thing I hate - when a boss or something appears to explode, but he's still standing once the explosions over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 ... 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Strider" is not a horrible game; it just lacks that special something that the best Capcom games have. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And most's predecessor "Bionic Commando" was much more creative, especially It came to the grappling hook and the various ways you can move around in it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And for God's sake, the game ended with Hitler's head exploding. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here always gives you stabbing the evil computer tree; it's not nearly as spectacular. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And cap bombs next big Action Game was DuckTales. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Strider" seems [pretty] weak when compared to Capcom lineup at this time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, compared to most effort of Action Adventure Games free from this era (from companies that weren't Capcom or Konami or Sunsoft) it and [pretty]'s good. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, make of that what you will. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mother 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo | APE | Pax Softnica 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, let's work on finishing up the Japanese releases for July starting with the big one. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it finally happened, Nintendo broke down and made an R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Amazingly, "Mother" was the [only] high profile triple A type game that Nintendo released in 1989. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unless you count those FamiCom desist Adventure Games like FamiCom detective club. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No "Mother" almost got a U.S. release. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was completely localized Are they an "Earthbound"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it seemed that Nintendo of America's marketing department decided to focus on the games for the upcoming Super Nintendo instead. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, what we're playing here today is the unreleased U.S. Translation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You choose your characters names, but I'm going to go ahead and use the names of the characters from the Super Nintendo "Earthbound", because they're basically the same characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also need to put in your favorite food. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Traditionally, one types in something like pussy or s---, something like that, which leads to much hilarity later in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I'm going to go with a real food first seemed like for a healthy restorative foods, so that's what I'm going to put in, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, in 1989, [pretty] much every company releasing a FamiCom games had an R.P.G. under their belt except for Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, when they finally decided to throw their hat into the ring, they obviously had to make a game that stood out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, we've seen a lot of R.P.G. set in fantasy dungeon dragons worlds and there are several World Science-Fiction themes or historical legendary Japanese themed, but "Mother" has a quote unquote real world setting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it takes place in like a wacky version of the suburban United States, and mixes and stuff from troll shorts as peanuts comics, along with U.S. Those rock 'n' roll and robots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And before it's because it's the Japanese game It also throws in children with psychic powers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game begins with a prologue involving your grandparents, Georgia Maria, who disappeared years ago under mysterious circumstances. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Georgia turns to years later but remains silent about what happened and where Maria is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Years later your suburban peaceful existence is disturbed when household objects start coming to life and attacking people. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, unlike R.P.G.s, nowadays, or even things like NFC star, the action starts immediately. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your first battle happens like literally seven seconds into the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to dispatch a few lamps and one creepy looking naked possess baby doll. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After being the doll, you get a level experience. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you have a brief conversation with your mother and father before sitting out on your adventure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this might lead you to believe that "Mother" is going to be like a briskly paced game without all the bullshit grinding whatnot of other R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it turns out this is tragically incorrect. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is the first song that you find. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main objective the "Mother" is actually to find all eight songs. Though the game never actually explicitly states this, I suppose until you get to the very end. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Throughout the game world you'll find telephones. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, these allow you to talk to your father who is on some sort of neverending business trip. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Talking to your father on the phone allows you to save your game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also (this being quite important). Talking to your Father gives you money. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see the enemies in "Mother" do not drop money directly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead, your father gives you funds when you talk to him by deposited into your bank account. which you can then withdraw it from using ATM machines. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the first course of action is to find the basement key, and lock the basement, and find your grandfather George's journal. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead of treasure boxes, everything is in these little like gift boxes with a bow on top. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also find the first weapon a plastic bat, which is down in the basement. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, your folks tell you that your grandfather's studied psychic phenomenon and that you have latent psychic abilities. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, it's up to you to figure out what's causing all the lamps and dolls and stuff to come to life. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Outside you'll find animals and people that have all gone crazy and, sort of, tacking you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, while you presumably kill the animals, you beat a bowtie or Baseball bat and told a quote unquote return to their senses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the best things that you encounter is the hippie who has this super awesome music, where this great Chuck Berry riff starts playing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, a bit of a background about "Mother". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was co developed by Nintendo, Pak soft nica, and a company called eight, which later evolved into creepers incorporated to do work on numerous Pokemon games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, apes founder and the main creator of "Mother" was one she was Satoshi toy, a Japanese media personality. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, a toy wrote books, appeared on TV, did voiceovers for movies, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But his claim to fame was (oddly enough) as a copywriter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the field of writing copywriters are, sort of, near the bottom of the totem pole. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're like the anonymous hacks who write the text that appears on advertisements and that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the English speaking world, there really aren't any famous copywriters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, at best the advertising agencies that hire copywriters will become well-known. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even for the most effective and influential piece of copywriting ever, which would probably be a diamond is forever for De Beers diamonds. The person who wrote it, Mary Francis Garrity, didn't become famous afterwards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, for example, do you know Who wrote, where's the beef? or Pepsi toys with integration?, Of course, not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yet in the role of 1980s, Japan somehow managed to finagle his history of successful catchphrases into a media career. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And became according to some Wikipedia editor, quote unquote, one of the most influential cultural figures in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, hardcore gaming one-on-one recently did an article covering the 'Earthbound' series with a lot more info on the guy so check it out if you want some more background on this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, it turns out that a "Mother" (while obviously referring to 'Mother Earth') comes not from the badass Dan dick song of 1988 but from the much riskier john lennon plastic Ono band tune, which is, sort of, a shame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the games music is actually quite innovative and it's by the Japanese musician he Suki and Nintendo's very own hip Tanaka. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some rather tense music, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy will be recognizable to "Earthbound" fans. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's the first boss and probably the first indication that aliens are somehow involved. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Early in the game, we rescue a missing girl who joins your party temporarily. Then you fight some zombies and investigate a zoo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Things suddenly take a turn for the weird when you find this cave, and a mystical portal of some sort, and then... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You find yourself transported to the other worldly magic hand or magic content, which I guess is really not too weird. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But houses look very much like Earth houses on the inside. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you have [pretty] much the same stuff as Earth towns, shops, hospitals, ATMs, telephones, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] much everything except the shops. It's free. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shops and mothers sell food health items the usual stuff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Weapons are normally found in sporting goods section of the stores. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the armor consist of rings and coins, oddly enough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And magic and is I think the [only] place that sells these. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you could in theory, buy the best armor right now if you have enough money. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, there are not a lot of weapons or armor in this game compared to something like "Final Fantasy" where you're constantly finding new armor and weapons and shops and round dungeons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, my main character, Ness, I found that plastic bat at the beginning, and the first town about a boomerang, and then found the best weapon Hanks bat near the end. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, it really [only] had three weapons for the entire game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The other characters were, sort of, similar so I spent most of the game on the same equipment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here Queen Mary indicates that you need to find eight notes and she'll remember her saw. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These notes are actually for like little phrases of a song apparently. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You found the first one and the dog the beginning of the game and you'll find a few others along the way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The rest of the game is more Less finding those notes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So far, and whether you were given hints as to where to go or what to do. But once you've exited magic can't the game someone becomes [pretty] open and nonlinear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's up to you to explore the world and figure out what the hell to do. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will soon end up near a town called Marysville at a school. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When talking to the kids, you'll get to be given hints that you should head out up to the roof. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And once you get the door open, you'll find a kid in the garbage can. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And boom, you have your first permanent party member, Lloyd (or Jeff, as I call him). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He joins a party at Level 1 so he's going the next hour so desperately trying to avoid and getting killed every single battle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's no easy way to revive a dead party. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember, you need to get him to a doctor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, by the way, there's no, sort of, fast transportation or anything at this stage, other than the ability to travel back to Magica. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, One really cool thing I found is the train rides. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes the lack of clues or direction can kind of get a bit frustrating. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, in this town, Spookane, the citizens will mention a haunted house. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The owner tells you his family had to move out because of ghosts or monsters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, earlier in the game, you had, sort of, experienced a similar situation, though what you fixed by killing this possessed doll. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And later you investigated why the animals at the zoo were going crazy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you fix this problem by finding the fitting with Star man. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, logically, you assume you're going to enter the house. And find the source of the problem, probably have a boss fight, and then the Grateful family can move back in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Inside the house, you'll fight lots of difficult ghosts and monsters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mysterious voices will tell you to turn back. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You find a piano from which you learn another tune. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I spent a lot of time wandering through the house through a series of confusing and identical looking rooms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I couldn't find what I was supposed to do. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I tried using telepathy on random stuff, looked for hidden doors, and was getting [pretty] darn pissed that I could not figure this out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I looked up the solution. And it turns out, there wasn't anything else in the house at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No boss battle, you know, get rid of the house of ghosts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no resolution to this little mini plot about the displays family, sort of, defies R.P.G. side quest logic, as well as our expectations based on quests earlier in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I know that fantasy comm era R.P.G.s are known for being [pretty] obscure when it comes to what you're supposed to be doing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But "Mother" often crosses the line into you know, you're just, sort of, wandering around randomly territory. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Doesn't help with the rule seems so spread out and it's kind of hard to navigate. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are two types of overworld that will be found in J.R.P.G.s of this era. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's like the 'Dragon Quest' type, where when you exit a town, you suddenly blow up like Godzilla size and you can strike across hills and forest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then there's the type word towns and the roadmap are, sort of, on the same scale, for example, and Hercules no Aiko are some other games that we've seen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Mother" uses the second type, which makes the game world seem quite enormous. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it feels like you've traveled, sort of, huge distances, which is [pretty] cool. Despite the fact there aren't really that many locations, especially when compared to something like "Dragon Quest III". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are seven towns three factories one desert, a mountain. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But just getting around involves navigating through maze-like forests, as well as hills and swamps. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At some point, I'll find a hat logging into a girl you find in the far corner of the world in a town called snowman. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Giving her back the hat will cause her to join your party so that she can find her missing mother. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As soon as you leave the house you'll find it the monsters wandering around outside can killer with a single blow. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, once again, you need to spend a lot of time leveling her up so she doesn't die every single battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Being a girl she's super weak but has strong magic as per RBG conventions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this, you can just, sort of, wander around and actually "Mother" does have some cool stuff mixed in with the neverending Random Battles like an airplane ride. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you take the airplane ride multiple times, you get to bro this guy's tank and the tank music is [pretty] metal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However the fun ends when you encounter this giant robot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the tank protects you from damage and your party attacks using the tank gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can't actually lose this battle but the tank will be destroyed afterwards. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other things you can do in this area: there's a hidden mine that you can find, but it's [pretty] well hidden and you won't be able to find it without looking up in a walkthrough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this right here is a nice touch. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In a nearby town you'll find all the adults have disappeared. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you can learn a very helpful teleportation spell, which is quite frankly a godsend since prior to this, you had to walk everywhere on-foot unless you are going to magic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's a few more weird things: 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you find the role you rescued in the games beginning living out in a house in a swamp. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 She'll refill your health for free. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, Jeff's father is hiding in a garbage can outside the house (who asked you to put in your name). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The final town is called L.A. and you find a tall building with an observation tower that leads to a side quest and while we're getting some strawberry tofu. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But what you're actually looking for here in the town is the local dive bar, where you're supposed to sing a song, but instead you do a synchronized dance routine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really, I think a lot of the appeal of "Mother" has to do with these cute little moments. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As an R.P.G. the game is not really that great, but it has a certain level of emotional involvement with its themes of absent or missing parents. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's a lot of charming stuff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really "Mother" completely rides on these moments, because other than stuff like this, it's basically just constant random battles and boring dungeons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, the upshot of your dance routine is the gang leader challenges you to a fight and then join your party, kicking out the poor little web, Jeff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and another fun thing: 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This lady will offer to buy you a drink. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you say yes, the cops come in and haul you way to jail. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not really clear how old you're supposed to be in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess old enough for a lady in a bar to say you're a cute and buy you a drink. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the artwork and commercials You look like you're about 10 or so. Which makes me wonder why the cops didn't arrest the lady who is hitting on you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, the new guy Teddy enters your party already fully Leveled Up, which is a godsend. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And he is way tougher than Jeff or nest for that matter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The name Teddy is probably supposed to bring to mind a teddy boy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which is one of those British rock 'n' roll hooligan type dudes, sort of, like an American greaser but they dressed all fancy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, it's time to collect the last few musical notes and finish up the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, one is obtained from the sleeping dragon and magic and. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Others are obtained in the final location mount a toy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like I was saying "Mother"'s big weakness is that as an R.P.G., it's not that great. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He toy in a poor very creative and original in some ways, but in terms of gameplay, that is Basically copied 'Dragon Quest' (same combat system, same menus, same basic game mechanics). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are quite a few magic spells available but there aren't anything like elemental weaknesses (despite having fire, ice, and thunder attacks). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like 'Dragon Quest' you randomly get in like a super powerful attack every once in a while. And also randomly, you will occasionally just miss completely. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is a run option where you can run from a fight, but it [pretty] much never works (though you do actually have an imaginal escape spill that will work). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably the biggest weakness is the oppressive frequency of enemy attacks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You often find that you get in a fight every other step you take. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, the grinding; you will need to frickin grind a lot in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, the dungeons don't offer much in terms of cool loot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, there really isn't much in this game in terms of weapons and armor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The one exception is here, where you will find the best weapons for each character in this cave. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And yeah, some enemies are just really awful, tough and hard hitting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are instances where the weakest character will get killed in the first round. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there aren't any like Phoenix down type items; you can't just revive a character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But at least you've got Teddy. Right? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, he's [pretty] much indestructible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, a little plot twist happens here on Maui toy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You and Paula get some alone time (again something that kind of makes you wonder how old these characters are supposed to be). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, it's a cute moment and then... sudden robot attack! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is one of those battles that are like predestined where you can't win them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But suddenly, Jeff appears in another tank and rescues you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know where he got the tank from. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But Teddy is injured, and the almost useless Jeff rejoins your party. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, now you have to death prone party members again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thank God, we do find a fourth party member that is a robot that just destroys enemies and soaks up most of the damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is a huge relief when you find this thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Turns out that N.E.S. his grandfather built the robot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we also learned that he was taken to the quote unquote, end of the universe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This seems to tie-in to the whole business of people getting kidnapped by U.F.O.s that we've encountered at a few points in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, even this robot does eventually get destroyed, but you'll learn a tune from her. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And at the top of mount a toy, the final tune at what appears to be a magic stone of some sort. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It turns out the song is [pretty] much the key to finishing the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you remember way back earlier in the game, the queen of magic is asking you to find the notes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, at this point, you're supposed to work back to magic and to have all the notes the Queen will remember the song, and then the game's mysteries are all suddenly revealed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Turns out that Queen Mary is your grandmother Maria, who is somehow still alive and created the illusory world have magic hit (I guess because she has psychic powers) and then somehow suffered memory loss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess your psychic powers were inherited from her. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, she also mentions this mysterious ego. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this happens the final cave on Maui toys open where it turns out an alien mothership is holding all the kidnapped and abducted people. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Finally you reach the mothership itself and it turns out that Giga is, in fact, the alien. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, he cannot be harmed by physical tax and you're stuck trying to defend yourself against his rather powerful alien natural attacks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In between attacks, viga fills in most of the missing plot elements. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Basically, he liked Jordan Maria but then got mad when Jordan told alien technology. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once he's done talking, you defeat him not by using regular tax but by singing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Basically, this boss battle is entirely defensive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You just keep healing and singing and to eventually you win and we will be destroyed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the English translation turned about a prototype cart some years back under the name "Earthbound". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The translation team no I forced did some work to remove some of copy protection and change the title screen to read "Earthbound" zero. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this time some parties thought this was a fake. But eventually the guy from Nintendo America who actually wrote the English script didn't back confirm that yes, this was the official translation version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was never released because Nintendo's marketing department was tied up with the release of the Super Nintendo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, a few changes were made for the U.S. version; town names were changed to things that actually sounded less silly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, a toy mountain was originally called pulley loli mountain and the Japanese version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also there were small amounts of blood that were removed and crosses were taken off churches, that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, Nintendo did take the opportunity to improve the game, adding some more menu options, adding a run button and lengthening the ending. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the Japanese version of "Mother", the credits rolled as soon as the mothership flew away. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in the U.S. game, we get this lengthy closing sequence that sort of you know, tells you what happened to the characters afterwards. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite its flaws, "Mother" sold quite well in Japan and remains an 8-bit favorite among Japanese gamers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'd say it's about 50% amazing and 50% annoying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The story has a certain sort of emotional punch that it backs and the music is often fantastic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I guess the question is, should you suffer through it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess ultimately, that'll be your decision. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Famista '89: Kaimaku Han!! 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Piccari Games 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 1989 would not be complete without another volume in Namco's 'Pro Yakou "Family Stadium"' series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However it appears Namco has rebranded the series and it's now known as 'Famista' rather than 'Family Stadium'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So this is "Famista '89: Kaimaku Han!!" (which, I suppose, would mean 'Opening Game Edition'). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, regular viewers of 'Chrontendo' will know I complain about two things: Baseball Games, Golf Games, and -- (uh, make that three things): Baseball Games, Golf Games, and Mahjong Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the reason I'm getting so tired of Golf and Baseball Games is that they're all very similar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, Namco's Baseball series, in particular, never changes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 People nowadays complain about the 'Madden' games (how they're the same Game Over and over). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But at least 'Madden' makes changes to the gameplay or improves the graphics or something. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 With 'Family Stadium', nothing changes; it looks exactly the same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's the same music. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They haven't overhauled anything, other than updating the roster. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It really is exactly the same game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, take a look at this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Can you even tell a difference? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, what's this here? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Is this "Famista '89" or is it last year's game? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Or what about this... or this? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Can you tell them apart? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They all look identical. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Some things have definitely not changed - like the fact that so many hits are fouls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You often just get one after the other: Foul, Foul, Foul. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Other than that, what can really be said about this? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (I mean, nothing that I haven't said before.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess we can look forward to the 1990 version of this game next. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 31 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Now Production 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow. So two days later Namco released another game and this one's much more interesting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti" (meanings 'Splatterhouse: Naughty Graffiti'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Her dead boyfriend rises from the grave wearing a Hockey mask, and she seems surprisingly pleased rather than terrified. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the Pumpkin King also comes back to life and kidnaps her. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, we have the basic 'Ghosts 'n Goblins' storyline, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti" does resemble Capcom's game in a number of ways, now that I think about it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you go about your merry little way hacking up zombies with your meat cleaver or machete or whatever that is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, it should be obvious but this game is a cutesy, super deformed, humorous remake of Namco's Arcade Game "Splatterhouse", released in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The story of the Arcade Game is that Rick and his girlfriend enter this mysterious mansion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rick is knocked out and left for dead but this magical Hockey mask provides him (basically turning in him into like a super muscular version of Jason Vorhees, but a good guy). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we've seen games based on horror themes before like "Castlevania", but "Splatterhouse" is a little different; It was like bloody and grim. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are all these deformed freaks that vomit, acidic blood then die, tortured woman locked in cages. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole thing was utterly horrific. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, it's [pretty] weird that Namco decided to make a humorous parody version for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the first boss, a disco dancing vampire (inspired by Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video, I suppose). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After doing a little dance, he starts shooting fireballs, actually, while zombies attack. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Need to kill a certain number of zombies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this actually set a pattern for many of the boss fights, which often involves two enemies, one attacking you while you attack the other one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, this guy gets away and you never see him again because he's [pretty] cool. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually make your way to a little house. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we see a number of elements taken directly from the original game (like the spikes in the floor), but one particular pity plays a lot different than "Splatterhouse". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original game was a straightforward Beat-'em-Up, whereas the FamiCom game is much more 'FamiCom-ey'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (There's lots of platforming, jumping, and so on.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the final boss of the first level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this looks to me like a possessed doll. But people online seem to think there's a reference to the movie "The Exorcist". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 U.S. horror movies get referenced quite a bit in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This boss fight is actually [pretty] hectic and I was panicking a bit while I was recording this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this, you move on to Level 2 and so on (eight levels all together). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Notice that counter at the top goes up whenever you kill someone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or during boss battles. When you hit a boss the counter also goes up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of the most ridiculous of the boss battles chickens and knives. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when you beat this boss to get a little cutscene. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For floor collapses any fall several floors into the sewer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, this looks like one of those sorts of sewers you might find there a large metropolitan area, not beneath a little house in the middle of nowhere. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the one thing I like is the sewer does look filthy disgusting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, like I was saying when that calendar fills up your Health Bar increases. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, there is a slight R.P.G. element in this game (just like every other Japanese game at the time). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and this boss who was super annoyed by the way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The next level is a Halloween themed suburban neighborhood. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the way, you can find quite a few health refills in the form of candy or hamburgers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is a Texas Chainsaw Massacre. phosphite. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This reminds me a lot of band eyes "Monster Party" except the game is a bit -- a bit slicker. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Lots of well-known horror movies are referenced, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, this lady is badly infected with chestburster is normally pop out they look more like facehuggers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in a great little gag once you've killed enough of these things, the lady just gets up yawns and walks away. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess she's fine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the creepy part haunted church. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because those guys in the background with a flickering candles, a lot of great detail, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I love all the empty soda cans in the church. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you interrupt a satanic ritual of some sort (I mean, look at this, you could make a painting of this and put it like on a heavy metal album cover) and then the dude transforms into a goat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The next boss is based on the Cronenberg remake of the fly (will sort of). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the interesting part right here; there's a secret mini level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After defeating him, you immediately rush into the teleporter instead of waiting for the screen to fade out and it will get taken to the next level and be teleported to Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you get those Japanese umbrella Yokoi thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is actually a good place to farm for health refills, by the way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like I said, this is a very short level but at the end, you can find this lady does a little dance for you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's two things that can happen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can just sit there and watch it and she gives you a friendly message and hands you a crystal ball. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand (and this serves no purpose whatsoever other than to amuse yourself with) you can press buttons during the dance and you will start partying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 She will still give you the crystal ball but she will actually chastise you for being rude. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, what is the crystal ball do? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well you need to collect two of them in order to get the Slightly extended and. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Use your cleaver throughout the entire game except a couple places that you can actually pick up a shotgun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, seriously fucking up ghosts with a shotgun; that is [pretty] awesome. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This level is named diamond lake; that seems to be a reference to "Friday the 13th" but "Jaws" makes an appearance, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, this game is definitely not above mixing up its harmonies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was developed by Now Production who did lots of Namco Arcade Game ports as well as the occasional game for Hudson. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of their console regional titles was wagon land for Namco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They also do a lot of Baseball Games, but this is one of their most creative titles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We are approaching the Hill House now. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For those of you outside the U.S. or who live on one of the coasts of the U.S., a Hill House is actually a real thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're like these Christian haunted houses that show you the horrible things that happened to you when you dabble in drugs or abortion or homosexuality or that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No relation to this kind of hell house though, since this one was actually presented by a demonic from getting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This looks kinda like "Contra". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A relatively mellow level, but you can get the second crystal ball, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In a hallway you will encounter this guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Attacking him will cause him to grab you and throw you into this mouth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you continue on with the rest of the henhouse level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you don't touch him and walk into the store, you'll be transported to Egypt, where you enter the Great Pyramid and the lady who does the sexy dance. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll then get this second crystal ball and when you exit, you end up near the end of the Hill House. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hilariously, the funnel boss has a soda machine in the hallway (and the forces of evil like soda in this game) and you can refill your health by buying a few candles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, the Pumpkin King is a long boss battle where you have to hit him around 16 times but he's very hard-to-hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Every time you hit him he starts flying around and you have to wait for him to settle down like far enough so you can actually hit him again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also [pretty] difficult to hit him without getting hit yourself so you will often take damage every time you attack him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti" is one of those games that annoyed me while I was playing it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I remember thinking, "Man, I'm gonna trash this game when I cover it in 'Chrontendo'.", but by the end I was thinking, "It really wasn't that bad.". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And now but I think that I guess I kind of like it so I school like mellow out [pretty] quickly when it comes to playing games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One great thing about this game is the ending. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It turns out they're filming the movie (though this must be one really boring movie since 90% of what they shot was just one guy walking forward and killing stuff in a very repetitive fashion). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, the kid takes off the mask and the director tells him what a great job he did and then suddenly, a mask is alive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the standard and; the game ends, right here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, if you obtain the two crystal balls, you get this slightly extended ending where the guy and the girl (who are apparently dating in real life ... yeah and) -- they're outside chillaxing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A storm comes along and, 'Oh no! This is the beginning of the original "Splatterhouse"'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, Juan Pablo graffiti is the prequel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, the game has a great ending and the credits are [pretty] cool, too. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They use a "Castlevania"-style filmstrip thing, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, winners don't use drugs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, [pretty] cool mostly fun game - at times annoying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'd recommend it as one of the better games this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kyuukyoku Tiger 🇯🇵 // Twin Cobra 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 August 04 🇯🇵 // 1990 January [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Toaplan | Micronics 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by CBS/Sony Group Inc. 🇯🇵 // Sammy 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, kusoge fans, we've got a little somethin' somethin' here, for ya. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Kyuukyoku Tiger", a port of the Taito game, originally developed by Toaplan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But here it's published by CBS/Sony and ported by... Micronics! (second Micronics game today) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And they have, of course, known for their many horrible N.E.S. ports (like Capcom's "1942" - which, I guess, maybe this kind of resembles a little bit). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, because this is a cheap quickie Arcade port, it received a U.S. release under the name "Twin Cobra". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So let's get our bearings, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first of Toaplan's 'Tiger' games was "Tiger-Heli", released in arcades in 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It got a FamiCom release in 1986 (ported by Micronics) and we covered that in "Chrontendo ... 12". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Kyuukyoku Tiger" (the sequel) hit arcades in 1987 and it's definitely a better game than "Tiger-Heli" but... it isn't exactly a timeless classic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The U.S. Arcade version was called "Twin Cobra" (switching species, for some reason). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was first ported to the P.C. Engine and we already covered that one in "Chronturbo ... 3". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That version was [pretty] decent, but the P.C. Engine was known for having some fantastic Shooters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It didn't really stand out (at least when compared to stuff like "Blazing Lazers"). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously this version is way inferior to the P.C. Engine game in every department. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's an improvement over "Tiger-Heli", but it's kinda hard to go from the P.C. Engine game to this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, it never came out on the TurboGrafx-16 here in the U.S., so the N.E.S. "Twin Cobra" was really all we had over here... until 1991 when a Genesis version was published by Sega. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, unfortunately, this is something we'll be seeing more of. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... Now that we have more and more games are coming out on the Genesis and TurboGrafx, a game will be released on multiple platforms with the N.E.S. version often being the worst. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Cosmic Wars 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 August 04 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The second half of 1989 was eventful for Konami because of two well-known games: "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and (a bit later) "Castlevania III". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In between, though, we have a little-known title: "Cosmic Wars" - never-released outside of Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this one's rather interesting, because of one thing; it's technically related to the 'Gradius' series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll actually discuss that in just a second. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As luck would have it, there is an English translation of this game from the group trans BRC. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will give U.S. a bit of understanding of the backstory, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It turns out this war started because of some crazy 'the other guy fired first' situation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the next thing you know the "Cosmic Wars" have begun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Cosmic Wars" is a Military Tactics Game [pretty] much like "FamiCom Wars" or those st Gundam games from Bandai. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For one or two players (or zero, since you can make the computer battle itself). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The initial objective here seems to be to invade that planet they're held by the bad guys, who are the bacteriums the bad guys from the "Gradius" game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Various ships from "Gradius" make appearances such as the Vic Viper. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The one odd thing about this translation, some of the names have been changed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, here the Vic Viper ship is called the Sun Viper. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But in the Japanese version is called the big Viper (in Roman characters). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not sure why this is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first thing to do is naturally spend some money and buy some chips. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All of these have different stages. The weaknesses and uses (though I have no idea what they are). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Extended by a commander. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the military is some sort of free market system and the commanders are like free agent football players or something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was broke so I have the [only] have the options to buy crappy guys like teeth here; the guy's name is T. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You then need to put the ships into fleets and then assign a commander the fleet and then move your fleets. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You on the other side take turns on the C.P.U. is, of course, quite slow. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once your fleet is out there fighting the "Cosmic Wars", you gain control of planets, which gives you more income et cetera, et cetera and you continue to conquer more stuff out there in space, I guess. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At its core "Cosmic Wars" works just like all the other Military Games we've seen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But even uses the little animations of the two sides firing at each other when you attack, (like in "FamiCom Wars" or Military Madness). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is really [pretty] confusing and complicated. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, without the instructions, you will have no idea what these units do because they're all just spaceships with fanciful names like Falcon and injector and Tommy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's really no way to differentiate between the types of units. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With something like "FamiCom Wars", you had ground troops, tanks, aircraft artillery. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, you really have no idea what these things could possibly do. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Without a manual, it'll be impossible to know what these things are actually good for. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On top of this, you have levels, experienced, multiple types of attacks (like blast beam and H bomb), weird types of space train. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole thing is a bit more complicated and involved and not as intuitive as the similar games we've encountered in the past. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] much of U.S. pick up Military Madness and figure it out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Cosmic Wars" is going to be [pretty] darn tough to do this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's not like "Starcraft" or something where the tutorials are, sort of, built into the earlier stages of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Cosmic Wars" just doesn't explain anything to you in game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, it's very different from the usual Konami stuff. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Meimon! Daisan Yakyuubu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 August 08 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, it's Bandai! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We haven't seen a game from them since that, uh, cooking Adventure Game which came out like, uh, 11 days before this one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, what's that? N.E.S. worked on this game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knew? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Meimon! Daisan Yakyuubu" is another Baseball Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So far, [pretty] typical - choose your team, choose your pitcher, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least you get this cute little animated intro. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this looks [pretty] normal! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Though I really had a hard time hitting the ball - and when I did, I would [pretty] much always get balls). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And naturally the C.P.U. gets tons of good hits in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, if you do get kinda mad, you can always do this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Very cool! His helmet comes off and he crumples up real nicely. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If this looks a little better than your average FamiCom Baseball Game, that might be because it was developed by Human. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, because this is Bandai, they didn't want to risk making a regular generic Baseball Game, so they instead made one based on an animated T.V. series. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Meimon! Daisan Yakyuubu" started as a manga series in Weekly Shōnen Magazine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was created by Mutsu Toshiyuki, who might be most well-known for the 'Dr. Noguchi' series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The comic debuted in 1988 and later that year Few... -- Fuji T.V. ran the animated version, which lasted for about a year. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a High School Baseball team drama (though, based on the show's intro, there must be some sort of psychic power subtheme). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They've got these shots of bending spoons à la Uri Geller. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you remember way back to "Chrontendo ... 44", we discussed, uh, "Mindseeker", the game: based on a Japanese psychic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Geller was the spoon mending guy I discussed in that episode 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so what's the other thing on the menu? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Dramatic mode? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is this like the emo version of the game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is this the Dashboard Confessional remix where everybody's crying? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, yeah, based on this, I kind of guess it is - made wet tears everywhere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is, sort of, funny, but all the dramatic mode entail, there's a story mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe the original series was about a Baseball team that was about to be disbanded due to miserable performance. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, they tried make a combat and save the team. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sounds kind of like slap shot with about 1000 times less awesomeness. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh great, these guys. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, if I were designing a Baseball Game, I'd have it so you could hit a foul ball into the stands and take these guys out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game here is during this Pickler mode is the same, but just with little enhancements. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like instead of picking teams, the players are from the comic and even get these little portraits and things like that there's an animated Baseball during the pitches. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really recommending you play the game, but I suppose the dramatic mode is the way to go, if you choose to. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Moeru! Oniisan 🇯🇵 // Circus Caper 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 August 08 🇯🇵 // 1990 July [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Advance Communication 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toho 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, now here's an odd one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I know I say that like every single game we check out but this one really is kind of weird, well "Moeru! Oniisan". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Notice that we see the name in T.V. there on the copyright page. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, (guess what!) this is based on a cartoon T.V. show. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game has this prologue where you bet on dice roll. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Incredibly, it appears to be possible to actually lose the game and get a Game Over at this point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not many games will actually let you lose before the real game even starts. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's Monday bastard in the lower left; click a potential jersey short cast member. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think this dragon is the main bad guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original manga seems virtually unknown to the English speaking world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was created by a guy called to deshi Sato (not be confused with the Hawaiian artists from back in the 1950s, who, sort of, combine traditional Asian art with abstract expressionism). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This traditionally taught Oh has nothing to do with that guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The series got turned into an animated T.V. show in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Was about this brother and sister who were raised out in the wild and then they rejoined civilization (sort of like an anime version of no I guess). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like no but with more bad guy dragons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The character you're actually controlling here is Chi Ada the sister of the title character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well ever [only] son means something like burn Big Brother. And is called the burning wild man English. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is notable probably one of the most awkward looking jump attacks ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You bend over backwards to this kit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 More onus on most adult by advanced communication, the guys behind the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde game, as well as a few pieces of licensed junk. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 May think the story would end here but no. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently someone at Toho took a look at this and decided this absolutely had to have a U.S. release (despite being about a cartoon, or is it no one in the U.S. ever heard of). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, in order to make it releasable in the U.S., they changed everything. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. version called "Circus Caper" is barely even recognizable as a localized version of modero onesie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Gang Vax even has separate entries for them, but I'm considering them to be the same game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The title screen is quite similar, but the game itself became much more linear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Borrero have these doors that would warp you around, whereas "Circus Caper"'s [pretty] much just a matter of walking from left to right. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main bad guy has been replaced with this clown. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And hey, for all you adult people out there who claim that you're afraid of clowns or something, you know, just knock it off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just a man with slick makeup on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, they're there to make kids laugh. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If we're going to be afraid of something, make it something that can actually hurt you like rattlesnakes or people who drive all using their cell phone. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, your sister wins a free ticket. But after the circus is over, she doesn't exit the tent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Turns out she's being held hostage by some dude called Mr. Magic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this Mr. Magic has no relationship at all to the legendary New York DJ Mr. Magic, who had a very influential radio show in the early 1980s called rap attack. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mr. Magic inspired the great Houdini single magic swan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you played Grand Theft Auto Vice City, you might recall that Mr. Magic was in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He played the DJ for the old-school hip hop radio station. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And magic wand was one of the songs that he played. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 BJ. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, none of this has anything to do with "Circus Caper" hover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead, this game seems to have taken inspiration from Mr. Dark from the film version of something wicked this way comes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Which had, sort of, a similar plotline involving a sinister circus coming to town). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The mechanics are [pretty] similar to those of the original game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You punch and kick in ways to get power-ups either health refills or Special Weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The levels have been completely reworked. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, they've added these ridiculous parts where you have to jump on an elevator to cross a body of water. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, that's right manding in the water is an instant kill and you have one life. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, making one mistake and you have to restart the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to jump on these alligators with very precise timing (you know while they're open air close Their mouths) and there's clown jumping at you at the same time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And yet, this is supposed to be a game for little kids. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess someone really hated kids. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also have these pointless bonus stages. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On this one, you have some bearer jumping over dancing flames. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is for point [only] you don't really get anything if you succeed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the kid here still has that painful looking duck. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Among the special items you'll find will be brick blocks, which he liked, which higher areas. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not a bad idea, but it has a rather weird use later, as we'll see. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this part right here, you suddenly get a "JetPac" and you're flying around shooting other guys who also have jetpacks, (which is kind of weird because this is a circus). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The controls are [pretty] irritating at times in this particular portion, like trying to make these jumps into tight spaces. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here's another insane thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes the power-ups fly up to the top of the screen and never come down so you can't grab them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why? It was something they did on purpose? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first boss is some sort of forum clown head. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You read a few of those red and black power-ups and this guy can just be spam to that path. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I feel sorry for this boss; he's not even fighting back. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's like trying to get away; he's like, 'Stop hitting me!'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I also like the idea of this little kid beating up this guy for information (like mini Jack Bauer). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, here's that weird thing you can do with the brick stepping stone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In most levels, you can place one to the left side of the screen at the very beginning, and simply bypass the entire level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It takes you right to the boss fight. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like developers knew no one wanted to play this game, so they invented a way to skip almost the entire game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Circus Caper" is a fine example of one of those quickly made barely playable Platformers that clog up the arteries of the FamiCom and, in this case, (somehow) the N.E.S. as well. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Magma Project - Hacker 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 August 10 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Activision | Bits Laboratory 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tokuma Shoten 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Among the absolutely most-forgotten most-obscure games today is this one from Tokuma Shoten, the publishing company, (who was one of the very last publishers to still be putting out F.D.S. games as of late 1989). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is "Magma Project: Hacker". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, as we can see here, Activision is credited, ih, for the original game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And a 1985 copyright date is given (which means that yes, this is an adaptation of the old American Computer Game - first released on the Commodore 64, I believe). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game was designed by Steve Cartwright (an associative David Crane's) who did stuff like "Plaque Attack" and "Barnstorming" for the Atari 2600. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The original "...Hacker"'s opening sequence was, sort of, unusual. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You had to attempt to log into the game (sort of simulating what people supposed hackers did back then). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Through some kind of weird error message, you manage to bypass everything, and force your way into the system of the Magma Corporation (who's planning some kind of evil world-takeover scheme). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game involves, among other things, controlling a robot, navigating underground tunnels, and engaging in various forms of espionage. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The FamiCom Disk System "...Hacker" begins with a cutscene of sorts in which you witness a murder. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the murdered guy has on him (naturally) an F.D.S. disk. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya pop in the disk into your system and discover it's a way to access this robot named R-923. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then... yeah, it becomes one of these games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That is the Tokyo Tower over there, right? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So I guess this represents Tokyo? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, the developers of this game changed things up quite a bit from the original to make it a bit more FamiCom-friendly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You walk around talking to people and so on, but the real meat of the game starts when you enter the dungeon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this part, sort of, recreates the whole 'maneuvering underground tunnels' bit, using the robot, that was in the original game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You know, it's kind of odd, having played, uh, recently, uh, "Shin Megami Tensei 4" this actually reminds me a bit of that game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now Bits Laboratory supposedly had something to do with this (according to the Internet). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They also worked on Tokuma Shoten's port of Activision's "Ghostbusters". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here's one rather weird coincidence: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The name Hiroo Tochikubo is listed as the Producer of this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And he's also listed in the credits for the N.E.S. game "Labyrinth" which was developed by Atlas who, of course, were the creators of 'Megami Tensei' games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So does this mean anything? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, probably not. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, not a terribly interesting game, so let's move on. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Moulin Rouge Senki: Melville no Honoo (Melville's Flame) 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 August 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Interlink 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Gakken 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Assuming that you're able to parse those confusing block letters, you'll notice this game is called "Melville's Flame", published by Gakken and developed by Interlink. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The rather deceptively cool box art (which we saw a moment ago) gives a much longer name: "Moulin Rouge Senki: Melville no Honoo", which I guess we might translate as 'Record of the Moulin Rouge: Melville's Flame' (which is as a completely nonsensical-sounding title as I've ever heard). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Moulin Rouge' (or 'Red Windmill') is that famous theater in Paris and not to be confused with the movie of the same name (which just happens to be the worst goddamn movie ever made). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And Melville... I don't know; maybe Herman Melville? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Beats me. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So here are the game's characters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess these guys are nicely drawn. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You start by spending some money and building up your forces. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've done all this, you need to set out on your journey. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But what do these names mean? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Tsuwarfu?, Akantosu? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hmm. No idea. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now this game is a rather odd sort of, uh, combination of an R.P.G. and Strategy Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know; this is sorta like a 'Fire Emblem', uh, version 0.1. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But it's definitely not the first such thing we've seen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Remember Square's "Hanjuku Hero" from several episodes ago? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was also, like, an R.P.G.-style overworld, in which you, sort of, traveled around and had, sort of, similar battle systems where, uh, both sides would line up on each side of the screen and then engage in battle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Square's game, however, had automatic battles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Melville's Flame" you actually control your units in battle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 How it works is you, uh, select one of your units (which are all lined up in, uh, neat -- neat rows there). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then you, sort of, choose what you want to do or which of the enemy lines you want to attack. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You also have these random encounters, in which the enemies look like (um... I don't know) a combination between a pumpkin and a helicopter(?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Not sure what they're supposed to be.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Much like in "Hanjuku Hero", you're gonna run across these cities or castles, where you will need to defeat a series or -- of waves of enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And that's about it! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's what the entire game looks like, as far as I can tell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You know, after playing some of these, sort of, uh, terrible Strategy Games, I'm actually looking forward to getting around to "Fire Emblem" in a few months. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Takeda Shingen 2 🇯🇵 // Shingen the Ruler 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 August 21 🇯🇵 // 1990 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Another 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hot-B 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Almost done here, folks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Second-to-last game today is a another Strategy Game to cater Shingen to (the sequel to "hobbies to cater Shingen" from 1988). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This intro is [pretty] stylish, and hoppy was always known for having, sort of, ugly games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the first changing game, this was released in the U.S. under the name of "Shingen the Ruler". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, the situation is actually much like that of hobbies of "...Black Bass". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There was a crappier earlier game that we never saw in the U.S. And what we actually got was secretly and improved sequel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Though in this case, the introductory screen with a date is much less cool than the Japanese version.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the main control screen; you control xingda naturally. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Compare this to the first game and you'll see the interface have been made much more appealing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first one looked really boring. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, in theory, you will start by improving your Kingdom, building up an army and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, digging for Gold mines improving agriculture, that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let me do invest funds for improvements. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, I was actually attacked immediately by enemy forces. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I need to select how many troops they want to send and then putting them into divisions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have quite a few types of units (cavalry, infantry, archers, riflemen, and Lancers). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Riflemen and archers to use range weapon attacks are [pretty] good for picking off enemies from a distance. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Cavalry moves long distances each turn and one thing to note is that your ranged units can [only] shoot a straight line. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And for whatever reason, attacking is called 'rush' in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You're trying to pick off their calorie before they reach Me. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, things started going [pretty] badly as I was repeatedly attacking their horseman over and over, and I couldn't kill them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the fact I was [only] doing one damage per attack, and a single enemy could completely wipe me out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, he wiped out an entire division of mine would want to tap. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is because of rank (sort of like the level of your army). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You always, sort of, rank zero, and the enemy forces here, they're ranked 23. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I really can't imagine there's any way I can possibly win this battle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I don't want to get too deep into this game, since it's [pretty] complex, I would undoubtedly take a while to master. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you can clearly see it's very much more like the Nobunaga ambition or Three Kingdoms and all those games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really night and day compared to "Defender of the Crown" in terms of length and complexity. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have lots of stats: loyalty, culture, production (that is, uh, production of food), Goldmine output, disaster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can improve improve your castles, farms, flood control, and disease control. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can create alliances other warlords. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you have daughters, you can marry them off as Princesses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can spy using ninjas (all sorts of stuff). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It does seem sadistically difficult and fair from what I played. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe I was just unlucky. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, it looks like an unusually nice game from Hot-B. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Captain Ed 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 August 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by CBS/Sony Group Inc. 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, our last game today and it's a weird one: "Captain Ed". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, with a name like "Captain Ed", what, sort of, game do you think this is? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's see... "Captain Ed"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know; for some reason I assumed it was a Soccer Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But no, it's a Shoot-'em-Up published by Sony group slash CBS (the record company who also published Kyoko Tiger in Japan earlier this month). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, who developed this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If he did a lot of original games for Sony CBS. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is, sort of, like in the bizarre crappy style of Ico games like sukima to. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well darn it, this is one ugly looking game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your ship flies where these fields have squares which are either green, yellow or red. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With the green you can pass safely over. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yellow damages or help or energy as you can see on the right-hand side, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And red damages your health and prevents you from moving forward or the square. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And as you can see, the Square's are constantly shifting colors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, for this reason, there aren't a lot of enemies and those that do appear grow don't pose that much of a threat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hold the background Square's are probably more dangerous than the enemy ships. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, thankfully you have these gas stations scattered around the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, this looks like a regular gas pump, but with eyes and a hat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the gas station chick comes out and fuels your tank, including an animation of her (or dot representing her) slowly walking to and from your ship. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You make money by shooting enemies, and you can use this to either buy gas or buy items in the Item Shop. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In addition, you'll sometimes collect those smiley faces. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this will cause certain squares to flash blue, which means that there's stuff hidden in those squares. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can smash these squares wide open using your hammer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Yes, your ship is equipped with a giant hammer.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the shop. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can buy some very temporary U.S. weapons glasses (which do the same thing as the smiley faces: they allow you to see the blue squares) as well as, sort of, special items you actually need to buy in order to move on to the next level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I suppose the objective of "Captain ed" is to collect enough money to keep your health filled and to purchase those special items. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also find warp items in in some of those blue squares. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These will... (well, they) warp you to some bonus stuff... like playing drums for some big haired '80s Rock Band. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This part is actually a [pretty] surprising (sort of like a prototypical version of rock band). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You hit the A and B buttons as it instructs you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully anyone watching the YouTuber can actually see the button press instructions as they flash on screen really quick. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the kids today would call this you know, random humor or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You get rewarded with cash based on how you do (or you'll lose money if you do really, really terribly). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's another little bonus level reach by obtaining the warp item. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, you do this to make money. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually you'll get to the shop and you'll have enough money to buy that special damned item that allows you to warp to a boss fight. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, what the hell is this guy? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He looks something like you pull up a clogged drain. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Needless to say, these boss fights are not among the great shut up boss fights ever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this, well then you just repeat. (but now the squares look slightly different). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Captain ed" is so odd; it lacks everything you associate with good Shoot-'em-Ups of the late '80s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Like nice looking backgrounds, cool power-ups, awesome bosses). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And instead replaces all of this with this whole, sort of, Green, Yellow Red Square mechanic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, looking at Sony's output at this time, it's kind of hard to believe they're the same guys who released the PlayStation five years after this came out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, this game in late 1989 is actually closer to the launch of the PlayStation than it is to the launch of the family car. (Which is kind of weird when you think about it). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He'll Sony would actually demo the Nintendo PlayStation at CES in a couple years after this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yet they were still putting out crap like this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows why? 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 47 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, that wraps it up for today. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess I'll name the Best and Worst Games, this episode. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Best Game is, I suppose, "Mother"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not perfect (it's far from perfect) but there is an awful lot to like about it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, I might put "Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti" up, there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As for Worst, I'm thinking "Thundercade". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The original Arcade Game was not bad at all, but Micronics just completely screwed this up royally. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a huge mess of a game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The worst original game might just be "Moeru! Oniisan" (a.k.a. "Circus Caper"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No idea why this piece of junk was released in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, next episode will be coming out [pretty] shortly, I hope. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll just finish up August and move on to September. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's gonna be, sort of, a low key month, in terms of games that came out in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But we do have some weird Japanese releases, including a game based on a movie (that is just about the last movie that I ever thought would -- they would make a video game out of). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was actually a successful Japanese movie that somehow got a video game adaptation. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, honestly, if you were to make a list of every well-known Japanese movie and order it from 'most likely to get a video game adaptation' down to 'least likely', this one I think would be [pretty] near the bottom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'll give you a hint: it was a movie from the '80s; it was [pretty] well-known in the U.S. and has been readily available on home video for years. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you know what it is without cheating and looking it up on a chronological FamiCom list, I'll be [pretty] impressed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, we'll see ya next time. 🍇🍌
