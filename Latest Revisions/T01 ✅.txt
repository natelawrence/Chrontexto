👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chronturbo Episode 1 ✨


✅🌌🍊🍓 *Hi*, [and] welcome to the inaugural episode of '*Chronturbo*', where we take a chronological look at *every game* for the *P.C.* Engine ([otherwise] known as the <Turbo-Graphics-*Sixteen*::TurboGrafx-*16*> in the U.S.). 🍇

✅🌌🍊🍓 The *first* episode [will] cover <twelve::12> games for the system's *debut* in October <Nineteen-Eighty-*Seven::1987> through July* <Nineteen-[Eighty]-Eight::1988>. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to N.E.C. ✨


✅🌌🍊🍓 But [*first*], let's take a closer look [at] the folks [*behind* the] P.C. Engine. 🍇

✅🌌🍊🍓 [Unlike] the FamiCom [or] *Master* System, the *P.C. Engine* was a [collaboration between] *two companies*: electronics giant *N.E.C.*, and software maker, *Hudson* Soft. 🍇

✅🌌🍊🍓 So, *who* [exactly] *are N.E.C.*? 🍇🍌


✅🌌🍊🍓 *Well, [just like] Nintendo*, [they've] *been around* [for quite] a *while*. 🍇

✅🌌🍊🍓 *Nippon Electric* Company was *officially* formed in <Eighteen-*[Ninety]-Nine*::1899>, as a [joint] venture [between] *Western Electric* (the American *technology* company controlled by *Bell* [and] represented [in] Japan by Walter Tenney *Carleton*) [and] *two Japanese* businessmen. 🍇

✅🌌🍊🍓 *N.E.C.* was, [in fact], the first such *venture* [between] Japan *and* a foreign *company*. 🍇

✅🌌🍊🍓 *Kunihiko Iwadare*, one [of] the *founders, became* N.E.C.'s *C.E.O.*. 🍇

✅🌌🍊🍓 Under Iwadare, the *company* was *primarily* [concerned with] bringing *telephones* [to] Japan, [but] moved [into] radio [in] the <Nineteen-Twenties::1920s> [and] then [*computers*] in the <Nineteen-*Fifties*::*1950s*>. 🍇🍌


✅🌌🍊🍓 [It's important to understand that] when *N.E.C.* entered [the] video game *market*, they were *huge* compared [to the] likes of Nintendo or *Sega*. 🍇

✅🌌🍊🍓 They were a *major* technology research *company* and electronics *manufacturer*. 🍇

✅🌌🍊🍓 In the <Nineteen-*[Seventies]*::[1970s]>, [while] Nintendo was making *toys*, N.E.C. was designing communications [and] *weather* satellites. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When Nintendo was [creating the] *FamiCom*, N.E.C. was [designing] *supercomputers*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [At] one [point in] the *<Eighties::'80s>* ([and] then again more [recently]) the most *powerful* supercomputer *in the world* was, in fact, *from N.E.C.*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Seven*::*1987*>, N.E.C. was the [largest] semiconductor manufacturer in the *world* ([later] being overtaken by companies like Intel [and] *Samsung*). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, *while new* [to the] video game *market*, N.E.C. was firmly *established* in the consumer *electronics* field. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In <Nineteen-[Eighty]-One::1981>, they [introduced] their *enormously popular P.C.-<Eighty-Eight*-O-One::8801> ([sort of like] a Japanese Commodore <Sixty-*Four*::*64*>). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Along with the *M.S.X.* computers, the *P.C.-<Eighty-Eight::88>* [and] the P.C.-*<Ninety-Eight::98> were* the main [platforms] for Japanese [*Computer*] games *in* the <Nineteen-*Eighties*::*1980s*>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Presumably, Nintendo* was a [little] *nervous* when N.E.C. [entered] the console *ring*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Hudson Soft ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 [*Hudson*] Soft, on the other hand, *we [should] be* [quite] *familiar* with. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Founded [in] <Nineteen-[Seventy]-*Three*::*1973*>, in *Sapporo*, by the locomotive-obsessed *Kudo* brothers, *Hudson began* life as an *electronics shop*, but *moved on* to software design ([*supposedly* designing] software [for] the ancient *Altair* [computers]). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Another early [developer of] Altair software, *Microsoft, [later* went into the video] game field, *perhaps* with a bit more success [than] *Hudson*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *By the early* <Nineteen-[Eighties]::1980s>, Hudson [was] releasing *tons* of games [for] the M.S.X., P.C.-<[Eighty]-Eight::88>, Z.X. Spectrum, [and the] *like*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In *fact*, they seem [to] be mo... -- one of the more *prolific* Japanese game *developers* of the *time*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They [would continue releasing Computer] games [throughout] the [*<Eighties::'80s>*, but] *reached* a *major milestone* in <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Four*::*1984*>, when [they became] the *first* [third-party publisher for the] *FamiCom*, and had enormous *hits* with "Lode Runner" [and] "*Bomberman*". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ P.C. Engine // TurboGrafx-16 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, [*Hudson* had] *also* an interest in *hardware*, [and designed] a *chipset* that they called the <C-Sixty-*Two*::C62>, after [a] *locomotive*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This [*chip*], they [felt, could] be [used to] power a video game console *much superior* [to the] *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 N.E.C. would end up *manufacturing* Hudson's *system*, [while Hudson released] the initial *software*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The P.C. Engine, as a system, [was released in] Japan in *October* <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Seven*::1987>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In *Japan*, [the console was quite] *successful*, [outselling] the FamiCom [for at] least the first year [of its] existence. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Game Media ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Initially*, games [were released] on small *cards*, similar [to] those [used] by the Sega *Master* System. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] eventually a C.D.-ROM *add*-on [was released, and C.D.]-ROMs [sort of] overtook the card *format*. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ 16-bit Gaming? ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 [So], the *question* is, 'Is the *P.C. Engine* a <sixteen::16>-[bit] *system*, as [the] name '<Turbo-Graphics-Sixteen::TurboGrafx-16>' *implies*?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Well*, maybe. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It's *actually*] a bit of a *hybrid*, using [an] <eight::8>-bit *processor* [and] two <sixteen::16>-bit *graphics* processors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] *one thing* is *true*: The P.C. Engine *was* a next-generation *console*, with sound [and] graphics [that seemed] closer [to the] Genesis [and] *Super* Nintendo than the FamiCom [or] *Master System. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There *were* [certain] things the P.C. Engine *could [not]* do (such as multi-plane *scrolling*) [but it] *was* very strong [in] *other* areas, [such as] having a huge *color palette* [and C.D.-quality] *sound*. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ The System's Legacy ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Due to a lack of success [in] the *West*, the console is sometimes [considered] a *failure*, [but that] *wasn't* really the case in *Japan*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The system [outsold] the *Genesis* [and had] a long successful run. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Over <seven-hundred::700> *games* were *released*, with the *final* release, "Dead [of] the *Brain*", coming [out in] <Nineteen-[Ninety]-*Nine*::1999>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though <Nineteen-Ninety-Five::1995> was [really the last] big year [for] the system. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ The System's Library ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the U.S./West, the P.C. Engine [is] prized for [its Shoot]-'em-Ups, [but in] *Japan* there were [*also*] tons of *R.P.G.s*, *[Dating] Sims*, [and] the *like*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once [the] C.D.-*ROM* drive came out, P.C. Engine games became known [for their] high-[quality] anime-style cutscenes and [fantastic] soundtracks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *One thing* is [the] case: The *P.C. Engine* has a *huge library* of [little]-known games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Back to the Beginning ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 [*But* we're getting] a [little ahead of] ourselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [*Let's start*] back [in] October [<Thirtieth::30th>], <Nineteen-[Eighty]-Seven::1987>, [when the] *system* [was] launched [with] *two* [titles]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Bikkuriman World 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1987 October 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Westone | Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here [it] *is*, the [first] game [for the] P.C. *Engine, "Bikkuriman World"*, [released] on *HuCard* on October *<Thirtieth::30th>*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [If you notice] the *cover* art, a "*<Volume Two::Vol.2>*" [was in] the upper-[right] *corner*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Yes*, Hudson's [releases] are *numbered*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [*Apparently*], this [was] intended [to] be the [second *title*]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *other* launch [title is] Number *<Four::4>*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Number <One::1> [and] <~Two~::{3}> [actually] came [out *later*]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *[Right off the bat*, let] me mention *both* launch [titles] were [released in] Japan [*only*]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] *this is* [an] unofficial English translation by *Demiforce (one of* the very few P.C. Engine games *to be* fan-*translated*). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If *this somehow* looks a [little] familiar, *well then*, *maybe* it *should be*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We [actually] *saw* this game [in] the "<Nineteen-[Eighty]-Seven::1987> Arcade *Round* Up". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Or rather we saw the *original* version, "Wonder Boy in *Monster* Land", from *WestOne* [and] *Sega*.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [This] was the [second] game in the 'Wonder Boy' *series*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first "Wonder Boy" game *was released* [for] the FamiCom as "[Adventure] *Island*". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *striking thing* [about] "Bikkuriman World" is, [other than the] *character* sprites, [this is pretty] much an exact port of [the] *Arcade* game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] *two versions* look almost *identical*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [what's with the] name change? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, 'Bikkuriman' was a series of *stickers* [that] came *packaged* [with] a brand of *snack* food. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *These* were [popular with] Japanese kids [in] the [*<Eighties::'80s>*]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] a *spin-off* [animated] *series* followed ...[and] *a game*, [of] course. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Since Sega [owned] the rights [to the] Wonder Boy *character*, [Hudson's licensed] the game [*itself* and then simply changed the] names [and the] *sprites*, [just like] they [did with "Adventure] *Island*". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "*Wonder Boy* [in] Monster Land" *is* a [*bit*] of an *oddity*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [setting was changed] from the [prehistoric] island [of the *first*] game [to sort of] a standard medieval Fantasy world. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Additionally*, a number of R.P.G.-[type elements] were added *in*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [collect] money [to] buy [items in] shops [and] *so on*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 R.P.G. video game [elements] were *so pervasive* [in] *Japan* [at this] time [that] they were *even* creeping into *Arcade* games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Still*, the *game* is [*set up] very much* like a standard *Arcade* game [in] some [respects]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It's divided into] distinct *levels* [and ya] play [for *points*]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, [it's sort of] an odd *hybrid* kind [of] game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *one [frustrating]* thing: Equipment is *extremely* expensive and so is healing spells [and] *so* on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And *also*, there's the *timer*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya see [that] hourglass [on] the left? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every time [it] runs *out*, you actually lose one *heart* in your *Life* Bar. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 *Occasionally*, you'll [pick up an] hourglass refill*. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 [But] having [to fight] enemies [that] drain [your] health *and* a *timer* [that] drains [your] health is [*probably*] a [bit] much for a game like *this*. 🍇🍌


✅🌸🍊🍓 [There's also occasionally these, sort of] -- these [hidden] *doors* [to] find. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 Uh... *Entering* [this] door *here*, [for] example, [will open] up a [little] *side* quest for [you]. 🍇🍌


✅🌸🍊🍓 Every level has you [fighting at] least one boss in these *odd rooms* [that] look *[sort] of* like the [inside] of a castle or church. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 *Oddly*, [from] the [*outside*, the] *building* appears {to} be [about the] size [of a] *toolshed*. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 Yeah, this game [doesn't] always make much *sense*. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 [Defeating] *this guy* [will] give ya a [better] sword. 🍇🍌


✅🌸🍊🍓 [*For*] the [most part], though, the game has your standard Platform stuff [*with*] some very [light] *exploration*. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 [Though the] *timer* does put a [bit] of a *damper* on the *exploration* part. 🍇🍌


✅🌸🍊🍓 Is, uh, "*Bikkuriman World*" a [great] *game*? 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 *Well*, no, [not *exactly*]. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 [But *despite*] being [an] Arcade game, [it] *does* seem more [at] *home* on [a] *console*. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 [It's not that different from the countless] side-[scrolling] Hack-'n'-Slash games [on the] *FamiCom*, [at] this time. 🍇🍌


✅🌸🍊🍓 [It's] *odd* [that] *Hudson* would *launch* with *two games* that're both *ports*, [and] *one* being based on a [licensed] *property*. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 [And neither] one really [*quite*] shows off the P.C. Engine's full [capabilities]. 🍇🍌


✅🌸🍊🍓 Oh yeah, [and] please tell me this [guy's] name is [not] '<Satan-Maria::SatanMaria>' [in the] *Japanese* version. 🍇🍌


✅🌸🍊🍓 Though "Bikkuriman World" [is *impressive* for just] how close [it gets] to the *original*, "Wonder Boy [in Monster] Land" was, uh, [*later*] given a [port to] the *Master* System, [and that] ended up looking [*quite*] inferior [to] this. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 If the *point* of "Bikkuriman..." [was to] say, '*Hey*! [Unlike] the FamiCom [and] the *Master* System, *this* new *console* [will] feature [*perfect*] versions [of] *Arcade* games.', then I *suppose* [it] *succeeded*. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 Though [it *wasn't] really* a *killer app* [for] the system. 🍇🍌


✅🌸🍊🍓 There're [*definitely*] some [*irritants*], like the [fact that it's just sort] of *hard* [to get enough] *gold* [to] actually *buy* anything. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 You [can't] really [grind for] *cash* [while] playing this game. 🍇🍌


✅🌸🍊🍓 Oh, *finally*, I've [actually gotten] some [*clothes*] for my character. 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 He [starts] the game *virtually nude* (just in [his] *underwear*). 🍇

✅🌸🍊🍓 Though [that particular little, sort] of, pink nightie thing ([it's supposedly] armor) [doesn't really] make [him] look that *macho*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I [don't] really [like] the [layout] of the *screen* [with all sort] of the [wasted] space found on the side [and] the [bottom], there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, *overall*, [for] a first [effort], it's -- [I suppose this] is really [not that] *bad*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [If ya compare it to], say, (I [dunno]) the [launch titles for] the *N.E.S.* ([like] "*Donkey Kong*") or [for] the Sega *Master* System ("*Hang On*"), I guess [this actually] holds up [pretty] *well*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shanghai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1987 October 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Activision | Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Activision? Brodie Lockard*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Does this sound] familiar? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yep! P.C. Engine game number <two::2> is a [port] of "Shanghai". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Let's think all the way [back to] "Chrontendo ... <Twenty-*Five*::25>". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We covered the *FamiCom* version [of this] game [from] *Sunsoft*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *The original* "Shanghai" *was* released for the Macintosh [in] <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Six*::1986> by *Activision*, though [it ended] up being [ported to] other systems [as] *well*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the game [existed] in *other* forms *prior* [to] the [Macintosh] release. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [Mac] version [is the] best of [these *early* releases], uh, [mostly] for the great high-res *graphics*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Though the *P.C. Engine* game from Hudson *also looks [pretty] darn good*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A pleasant felt-green *background* [and] bone-colored *tiles* show off the system's color *capabilities*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] *sure most* [of] you [have] played this game [in] some form [or] another. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But, just] as a reminder, the goal is [to] clear off [the] tiles, *two* [at] a *time*, by [selecting] a matching *pair*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] tiles [must] be *free* [in] order [to] *remove* them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can't] have tiles on either *side* or on *top* of the tile [you're tryin' to remove]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing [*about*] "Shanghai" - *Sunsoft's FamiCom* game [*didn't*] come out [until] *December*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the *P.C. Engine* actually was the [first release of] this [for] the *console*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*That's*] a [pretty] auspicious [*start* for] the *system*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Shanghai" is [reasonably] fun [and] *addictive*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... [And] there're some basic options; ([for] example, you [can] undo [moves if you find yourself] *stuck*, as I am *here*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Overall, [it's] a [*pretty*] nice *port*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One* odd thing [*about*] the P.C. Engine: [It actually] had different screen *resolution* [settings]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That] is, certain games (like *this* one [or] "*R*-Type", [for] example) would *actually* have a *wider screen* than *other* games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [we will] see the screen dimensions change [from] game [to] game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Kung Fu 🇯🇵 // China Warrior 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1987 November 27 🇯🇵 // 1989 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Note*] the *"<Volume One::Vol.1>"* [printed on] the *box* art's upper-[right]-hand *corner*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [can *only] assume* [that "The] *Kung Fu*" was [intended as] a *launch* [title for] the P.C. *Engine* [but wasn't] finished in *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Instead*, [it] came [out] three weeks [*later*] in *November* (the same day "*Punch*-Out!!" was released [for] the FamiCom [in] *Japan*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And *yes*, as we [can] see here, the game's official title is "*The* Kung *Fu*" (perhaps to distinguish it from *Irem's* "Kung Fu" *a.k.a.* "Spartan X"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] name is [pretty] *appropriate*, because *Hudson's* game is *really* just, [sort of], a *rip-off* of *Irem's* game, *which (by* the way) was *hugely* [popular in] Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [If ya] *compare* the two games t...k -- side [to] *side*, you [can, *sorta,] see* [what] a *huge advantage* the P.C. Engine *had* over the *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, the graphics had [*improved* quite] a [bit] since the FamiCom "Kung Fu" was *released* (as, uh, "*Punch*-Out!!" *proves*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *still*, the *P.C. Engine* was, [sort of], *clearly next-generation*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, *more* [than] anything, "*The Kung Fu*" seems [sorta] like a tech *demo*, rather than a *fully* [realized] *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *One* [of] the selling [points] {of} the P.C. Engine was the ability to [utilize] *huge* detailed *sprites*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] *character* is [realistically *proportioned*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] see lots [of] detail [in] the depiction of [his] torso [and in] the folds [of his] *clothing*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {A} good deal [of] *shading* is employed [to indicate patterns] of [light and] *shadow*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He even has a few different *facial* expressions and is *recognizable* as being modeled on Bruce *Lee*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So, your character] has a [certain amount] of *personality* [without] being *cartoony*-looking, as [in] "Punch-Out!!". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *And (five* years [before "Fatal] *Fury*") *blood* [and] *cuts* would appear on [your] face as you [got] damaged. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I *assume* that N.E.C. [and] Hudson were aiming [for an] *older audience* than [that] of a typical *Nintendo* fan. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Of *course*, the *game* itself is *[sorta] awful*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's, uh, [very repetitive and] memorization-based. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [There's *only*] one enemy *sprite*, [and] the bosses [also] *repeat*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, the *[first] boss* ya face ([that] *bald* guy [with] the, uh, torn *pants* there) is *[pretty] ugly*-lookin'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this is *[not] really* fun [to] play. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the two *launch* [titles], "The *Kung Fu*" [was] released *in* the U.S. [for] the <Turbo-Graphics-*Sixteen*::TurboGrafx-16> under the name "China *Warrior*" by N.E.C. *themselves*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Most [of] the early <Turbo-Graphics::TurboGrafx> games were [released] *by them* [directly]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *while "...Kung Fu"* is [sorta] laughed [at] today, Hudson did make, I guess, a [statement with] this game by showing the P.C. Engine's technical [superiority to] the FamiCom [and] the Master *System*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [can't] really [consider] the game t... -- a *failure*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, [it] is [quite] *impressive*-looking, I suppose, [for what] was [available at] the *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But really, I [don't] know [if this is] a game [you'd sorta wanna] pick up [and] play *nowadays*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kato-chan Ken-chan 🇯🇵 // J.J. & Jeff 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1987 November 30 🇯🇵 // 1990 March 15 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Okay*, so "*The Kung Fu*" [wasn't that hot]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But our] *second* [and *last*] game [of November, from] *Hudson*, is another [matter *completely], "Kato-chan* <and::&> *Ken*-chan". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your first] question would [obviously] be, '*Who are* these guys?'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, they were, [in] fact, Cha Kato [and] Ken Shimura, *two* Japanese *musicians* [and] *comics*, known for their band, The *Drifters*, [and for] their T.V. show, 'Fun T.V. with Kato-chan <and::&> Ken-chan', which apparently inspired 'America's Funniest Home *Videos*'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A *recurring theme* on the show would be [to] have them [portraying private] detectives, [and that's what] this game is *based* on. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *"[Kato]-chan* <[and]::&> *Ken*-chan" is [notorious for] one thing, the *sheer [amount]* of [scatological] *humor*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In [other] words, [there's] a [lot] of pee, poop, [and] farts in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, the game is [noted for] having tons of [hidden *items*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Kicking* stuff will yield *all kinds* [of] *coins*, [and] *health refills*, and *extra [points]*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} [*actually*] a really good idea [to] kick [pretty much] everything you *can*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also* a good idea is to duck [into] the public *restrooms* for a *health* refill. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *no*, [it's not] like *that*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [isn't] 'Grand Theft [*Auto*]'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But ya] *will* [get] a *weird* [little] scene of [Kato or] Ken *dressed up* in some *nutty outfit*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And the] *thing is*, there's *actually* all *kinds* of [hidden] stuff you [can] *find*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, the game borrows [an] idea from "Super *Mario* <Brothers::Bros.>". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *fact*, [out of] *all* the [*Platformers*] we've *seen*, this one *seems* to *have* the heaviest '...Mario' *influences*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a genuine *Hop*-'n'-Bop Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess [this is sort] of like a *much* less *wholesome* "Super Mario <Brothers::Bros.>". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 A [few years later], N.E.C. would [release] this for the <Turbo-Graphics-*Sixteen*::TurboGrafx-16>, [under] the name "J.J. <[and]::&> *Jeff*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, *one* cool thing: *Whenever* ya come across the other *guy*, you [can] *kick* [him and] send [him] *running*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Another] gross [little] *scene*, there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *For the U.S.* version, *these* guys were given even *uglier* heads and a *number of* minor changes were made. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Namely, some [of]* the seedier aspects were [toned] down. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Characters* [don't seem to] actually be *relieving* themselves [in] *public*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess they [didn't want] this game [to set] a bad [example for the] *kids*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*But*] the game still features public restrooms [and] big steaming brown piles of *bird* poop. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [However], *one* [little] change *has* been made; uh, the [*fart*] attack has [been] changed to a *spray* can of some sort. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Which], I* guess, really [doesn't] make [much sense when ya] *think* [about] it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah, there's the, uh, spray can being used, *there*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *perhaps* due [to] the [potty] humor [in] this *game, [it] has* [sort] of a *bad reputation*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Looking [at] the user reviews on *GameFAQs*, which is [not exactly] a forum for the highest forms of *criticism*, I was *baffled* [that] someone actually *scored* this <One::1> out [of] <Ten::10>. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *<lemme::[let] me> clarify* something *[right], here* [and] *now*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This game* is *awesome* - a *prime* example of the mid-<[Eighties]::'80s> style [*Platforming*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In [fact], *nowadays*, we might *call* this a spiritual *successor* to Hudson's "[Adventure] *Island*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It feels] *very similar* [to] Hudson's earlier game - has, [sort] of, very [similar] *levels*, has you picking up [fruit in order to replenish your] *Life Bar*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Really*, [it's sort] of like a *twisted* [and] even more amped-up *version* of "[Adventure] *Island*"! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] thing is, *I've played* a -- *tons* [of] crappy [Platformers] on the *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] "Kato-chan <[and]::&> *Ken*-chan" is *[light]-years* ahead of *most* [of] these. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The controls [are pretty] precise, there's, uh, [sort of spot]-on [hit] detection, and (*how cool* is *this*?) [you can] *kill* some [kinda] crazy *sea* monster by [*farting*] on [him]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And there's *lots*] of fun [*surprises* in] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One [cool] thing: [*Most* of] the [*hidden*] stuff [*isn't*] really [*necessary* to] complete the level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *really is* actual *bonus* stuff, though [it] *does* make the game *easier*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *coins* [that ya find can be] used in a [*slot*] machine [that will] *refill* [or] even *extend* [your *Vitality] Bar*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *one issue* [that] I do have is, *much like* "[Adventure Island]", the *environments [repeat]* after a while. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the game *can* be [*pretty] difficult*, especially as ya [get] near the *end*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But if ya] *do [wanna]* play a game [that] follows [in] the *footsteps* of "Super *Mario* <Brothers::Bros.>" [and] "Adventure *Island*", this is [*definitely*] one [to] check out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As [for] *all [the] people* who say [this is a] *bad game, do [not] believe* [them]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Victory Run 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1987 December 28 🇯🇵 // 1989 August 29 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *fifth* [and] final P.C. Engine game of <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Seven*::1987>, "*Victory Run*" - a *Racing Game* from *Hudson*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *one of the more* contemporary style Racing Games, *like those* we've been seeing from '*Chrontendo*' recently. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a menu *screen*; you [can] enter [your] *name* [and] (*most importantly*) stock up on [*replacement*] parts. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yes*, [your] car parts *wear out* in "Victory Run" *because [this is]* a [gritty] realistic *Racing* Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Except* [that] when ya *flip* [your] car over, you [can just hop] back in [and] keep *goin'*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess [*that's* not realistic]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Victory Run*" is [*kinda*] like "*OutRun*" - a *rally* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Meaning [that] when [ya] *race*, [you] begin [in] one location [and] race to *another* as [opposed to just] driving [around in] a *circle*.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As the map *hints*, [it's] based on, uh, Paris Dakar *Rally*, which [has *traditionally*] been a race from Paris to Dakar [in] *Senegal*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But], *according* [to] the map, [it] looks like [your] final [destination is in] Sierra *Leone* [or] somewhere. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's not] really *clear* why you appear {to} be driving *towards* Paris [rather than] *away* [from it in the first part of the] race. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Victory* Run" is *clearly* in the "*OutRun*"/"*Rad* Racer" genre, [*complete* with] *dips* [and] *hills* [in the] *road*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*And* while it's not] impressive visually as the Arcade "*OutRun*", it's *still very nice*-looking. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'd say [it] handles the <Three-D::3D> [effects] much [better than the] *Master* System ["OutRun"; *that's* for] sure. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'd say [that, not *surprisingly*], [this is] far [and] away the best-*looking* Racing Game we've seen on a console so *far*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] *goal* is to, uh, [hit the finish line within] a [certain] *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I} [haven't] really done so well *here*; [but in] my defense, "*Victory Run*" is [sort of] a tough *game (much more so* [than] "*Rad* Racer"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} *does take* a [bit of] practice. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Naturally, ya] go through day [and night] *cycles*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [night] scenes show the P.C. Engine's [*color* capabilities]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {A} [total] of <four-[hundred-'n'-eighty]-two::482> *colors* [can] be displayed on the screen [at] once, as compared [to] <*thirty-two*::32> [for] the *Master* System and, uh, *<sixty-four::64>* [for] the *Genesis*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [in that] *scene*, the sk... -- [night] sky is [dark] blue [with] *clouds* [and *mountains] visible* [in the] *background* [instead of just, like,] a [flat] black sky. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *In [between* rounds, you'll] need [to]... use [your], uh, *spare parts* [to replace] any [damaged] *parts*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Blue* means the [parts] are [in] good *shape* (like they [are -- all are] *here*, up [at] the *top there*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Uh... Though], as they turn *green* [or eventually] *red*, they'll stop functioning [*correctly*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *For example*, driving [in] the wrong gear [will] jack up your *gearbox*, [preventing] you [from] *shifting* [into] high *gear*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, [if ya] go *flying* over a *bump* [in] the road too [fast, your] *suspension* [will] take damage. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], *this far* [into] the game, your *pa... car* {will} [probably] be in good shape. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But once [ya get to] this *grueling [difficult* stretch of road through the] desert, [your] car [will] start [to] take [some] *damage*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Because you're] driving on unpaved *roads*, you [can't even shift your] car [into] high *gear*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *in conclusion, "Victory Run"'s a [pretty] cool game*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Strangely, we'll see another* Paris Dakar *Rally* game [for the] *FamiCom* in "Chrontendo ... <Twenty-*Eight*::28>". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to 1988 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, [just] *five games* [in] the [first] <sixty::60> days [of the] system's *lifespan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That's not really] too [great] of a *start*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*Master* System] had about *nine* games [*out* at] the same *point*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But *things don't really* pick up *too much* [in] <Nineteen-[Eighty-*Eight*]::1988>, [with] *games coming [out* at about] *two* a *month*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But [some great] games [were] *released* [in] <[Eighty-Eight]::'88>. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [*let's start* with the] first half [of that] *year*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jaseiken Necromancer 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1988 January 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Right*] off the [bat], Hudson wins the award [for] *coolest [title] screen* [and] *[weirdest] music*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] some *[pretty] moody stuff*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [don't] think we've *heard* [anything *quite] like* this in 'Chrontendo', so *far*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *here we have* "*Jaseiken Necromancer*" (or 'Evil Holy *Sword* Necromancer'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The most immediately striking thing is the *cover* art done by Swiss artist H.R. *Giger*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] I'm *[not] sure* if [he designed the] face [on the title] screen [as] *well*, [but it's] *clearly* [in] the Giger *style*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *As* ya may [have] figured out, "*Jaseiken Necromancer*" is the first *R.P.G.* [to] be released [for the] *P.C.* Engine. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hudson [had] dabbled [in] R.P.G.s [*before*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We saw their "Momotaro Densetsu" [in] "Chrontendo ... <Twenty-*Three*::23>" [but] this is [an] *entirely* [different] *beast*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "...*Necromancer*" seems a [*little bit*] more Western-*influenced*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] actually *choose* your party [from] five different *character* types, [sorta like] "*Dungeon* Master" [or] something. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or [like] "Dragon [Quest] *<Three::III>*" which [would] be [out] a [little bit later] in <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Eight*::1988>. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Note* the *[animated] flames* [in] this scene. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Hudson] throws [in little] touches like *that* [to] make the game seem a [bit] more *next-gen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, the *characters* are more [realistically proportioned than] most Japanese R.P.G.s we've seen, so *far*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is [certainly not] as impressive-looking [as] some [of] the [later] <sixteen::16>-*bit* R.P.G.s. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But *still*, it] is *comparable* to Western Computer R.P.G.s of the times, [in] terms [of] *graphics*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [What I'm actually] doing *here* is picking [out] my [*party*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Out] of *five potential party* members, you [can pick] *two*, [so you're actually] gonna have a [party] of three people ([*including yourself*]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[So], after* picking [out your party], ya walk around *town*, blow your stockpile of *gold* on armor [and] *weapons*, talk to some *N.P.C.s (ya know, [just]* the usual stuff). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You probably] know the drill by *now*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *graphics* [might] be [better, but] the, uh, N.P.C.s [still] stand around doing *nothing*, '[Dragon Quest]'-style. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As *expected*, ya have your random *encounters* on the world *map*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Combat] works much like [in] "Dragon [Quest] *<Two::II>*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] select {a} group of *monsters* [but *not] an individual* monster. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *[weirdest] thing* is [that] when ya *kill* a monster, it *explodes* into a *bloody mess*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Watch this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Holy cow*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some violent *stuff*, [there]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And then *check* [out] *these* guys. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ew!] Their *intestines* are all *piled* up on the *ground moving around*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As I [mentioned before], the *P.C. Engine* [seemed to be sort of] aimed [at] an older *audience* [than] the [FamiCom]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "...*Necromancer*" seems {to} be, [sort] of, Hudson's [attempt at] a more mature *R.P.G.*, one with a darker *theme* [and] more *gruesome [subject matter]*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *one odd thing* about the, uh, [combat] is the *Flee* option. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your party] members *flee* individually. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That] means [that] a [party] member *can* be left *behind*, as we see *here*, if [his] attempt [to] flee is *unsuccessful*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So] ya [*might*] be, uh, stuck [fighting] a monster by [*yourself*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll [naturally] need {to} do the old 'grind [and] heal' bit, [eventually] gaining enough experience [to] level up [and] make it [to] the next *town*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, [your] *characters* [don't] all level up [at] the same number of [*Experience* Points]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] *also* [kinda like] "Dragon Quest *<Three::III>*", which (once again) [hadn't] come [*out*] yet. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, from *[what] I've* played, uh, "...*Necromancer*" [doesn't] really seem [to] be a *bad* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's certainly better than] "Sword of [*Kalin*]" or "Hoshi no [Miru *Hito*]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *does seem* [to] be, [sort] of, [pretty], uh, *typical* [in] terms of, uh, Japanese R.P.G.s, ya know, *gameplay*-wise. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *I guess* the [interesting art design] makes [it] stand [at] -- stand [out] a bit. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The P.C. Engine *would* [eventually] become [sort of] like a *[pretty] heavy* R.P.G. [platform in] *Japan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [But for] *now*, [this is] all we've *got*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Next* year, in *<Nineteen-Eighty-*Nine*::1989>*, Hudson [will release] *another* R.P.G., "*Dungeon* Explorer", [that *might*] be a [bit] more familiar [to] Western gamers, *as* [it] was [released in the] U.S.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} [*probably* also] a [better] game [than] *this* one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [*suppose*], for the, uh -- *their first attempt* [at] an R.P.G. on the *P.C.* Engine, it's [*certainly* not] *bad*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Yokai Dochuki 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1988 February 5 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Namco | Tose 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There was [only] one *game* released in [*February*]: "Yokai *Dochuki*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But as you [can] see *here*, it's from *Namco*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yep*! Namco jumped on the P.C. Engine [*bandwagon* quite] *quickly*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Namco always seemed a [little] antagonistic towards *Nintendo*, so it's [*not surprising* that] when a potential [*competitor*] came along, Namco showed some *interest*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Namco's [first] P.C. Engine game was a *port* of the <Nineteen-[Eighty]-Seven::1987> *Arcade* game known as "*Shadow* Land". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We saw this during the "<Nineteen-[Eighty-Seven]::1987> Arcade *Round* Up". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *I believe* this was Namco's [*first*] game for the new *Namco* System *<One::1>* board. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the *Arcade* version, *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was also [one of the first] Namco *Arcade* games to employ a more open-ended approach [to] level design. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's [plenty] of branching *paths*, *secrets*, [multiple] *endings*, [and] *so* on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's almost] more like a *Console* game than traditional *Arcade* game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's, [sort of], a [secret little] gambling scene [right] here, [for] example. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Not to] mention, of course, [that the] graphics were [quite an] *improvement* over anything seen in [the] prior Namco *Arcade* games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] the *Console* version, [however], the game was changed up [quite] a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That] is, the actual [layout of] the *levels* [has] been changed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game has, to a [*certain*] degree, been *simplified*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, a [*lot of*] the things in the Arcade game are *here*, [for] example, the hidden *gambling* scenes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {You} [can] actually make some [pretty] good money on this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Basically, ya [bet] on odd [or] even dice rolls, [kinda] like in "<~Konami's~::[Konami]> Wai Wai World". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] money is quite [important] in this game, as we'll see a [little bit later]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the *boss [battles]* are [somewhat] odd; ya [*don't fight*] them [*directly*, but] rather you *summon* a *spirit* [to defeat] the boss. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing*: There's *no*, [sort] of, [automatic] *healing* after the end of each *level*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Ya only* have one *life*, so you [can] end up with your health [*pretty*] much [depleted] after a *boss* [battle]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing* ya *will* need [to] do is [to] buy some *health replenishing items* [from] the *stores* [that] appear, [from] time [to] time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Conveniently], they [often put] them [right at the] *beginning* of the next *level*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The various *soup* bowls there for -- will replenish your *health*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The webbed [feet are necessary to get] through a *water* portion [of the] level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While "*Yokai* Dochuki" *looks decent*, [it's *definitely* not as pretty as the] *Arcade* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *colors* are a [bit] washed-[out]-looking [and the *sprites* are definitely not as] detailed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [This was apparently ported] by *Tose*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, while it's not] a *terrible job*, [it] is a [little] disappointing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The Console version is a [bit] easier [than] the Arcade game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The levels are simpler, [as] I mentioned *earlier*, [and] there's [not quite] as few enemies [in] some [spots]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Still, this game does punish you *severely* [for] making simple *mistakes* [like getting], uh, [knocked off] a [*platform*, for] example. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's the [second] boss (*very similar* [to] the [first] boss). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, [and] *here's* [what] I mean [about falling] off a [*platform*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {You} [need to] take [out] those red *demons* [before ya] even *think* [about] landing on the [ground] *level*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you [get stuck] down there before ya kill 'em, [you're] -- well, [you're pretty] much screwed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *here*, [for] *example*, in [order to] proceed, [ya hafta cough] up <three-thousand-dollars::$3,000> in *money*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [If ya don't] *have it*... *well, then* [ya get sent back to the beginning] of [the] level! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, to make matters] *worse*, there're these enemies [that] *steal* money [when] they *touch* you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] *this* [point], I [pretty] much [lost] patience [with] the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still*, it's [an interesting] game [and] one [that's not] too well-known [in] the West. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 R-Type I 🇯🇵 | R-Type II 🇯🇵 // R-Type 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1988 March 25 🇯🇵 // 1989 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: IREM | Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Alright, *folks*, here [it] *is*: March <Nineteen-[Eighty-Eight]::1988> [and] the game [that we've been waiting] for, the P.C. Engine's killer app. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 No, [it's not] "Keith *Courage*..."; it's "*R*-Type", {a} [port] of Irem's classic [<Nineteen-Eighty-Seven::1987>] Arcade [Shoot]-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If, among the early [P.C.E. releases], there [was] *one [title* that] really showed [what] the system [was] *capable* of, [it] was *this* one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *two big* [Shoot]-'em-Ups of the [*middle* of the] *decade* were Konami's "Gradius" [from <Nineteen-Eighty]-Six::1986> [and] Irem's "R-Type". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *"R-Type"* took the [basic] *blueprint* of "*Gradius*" [and] made [it] even *cooler*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [When it hit] arcades, [it was] *very much* [cutting] edge, [with] *fantastic*-[looking] *graphics* [and] *music*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] yet, here [is] the *P.C.* Engine [with an almost *identical*]-looking *home* version. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One of* "R-Type"'s [strongest] elements was a *very* [creative] sense {of} *design*, with its weird H.R. Giger-like alien *world* combined with *mechanical* [and] *organic* in a, [sort of], *creepy* [and] unnatural *way*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *home* version *[completely] captures* that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The first] level, [in particular, is *pretty] memorable* with [these giant] pincher-like *contraptions* [that ya] *fly* through. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Let's*] compare the two *versions*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here's* the *Arcade* "R-Type", the [*first*] boss, which [tends to wind] up on almost all the *box [art* for] the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] now *here's* the *home* version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's *virtually* a pixel-by-pixel [*reproduction*] of the [*original*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *first* boss [demonstrates] the [importance of what the] game calls the *force* ([that little] indestructible *sphere* [that] can be attached [to the front] of [your] -- [or] back of [your] ship). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*It can*] be [shot out and] used [to hit] *enemies* [behind] *barriers* [and] such. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Furthermore*, whenever ya pick up a *power*-up, the *force* {will} be turned into a *special weapon* when attached [to the] *ship*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One of the special *weapons* are these *lasers* [that] bounce off [*surfaces* and can] damage enemies above [and] *below* ya. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Also*] very useful are the *bits* - the [little floating] spheres [that can either] go above or below [your] *ship* [and] do damage [to] enemies [that] they *touch*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Another power-up you [can get are] the *missiles*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Unlike]* "Gradius", *these fire automatically* when ya [*shoot* your] *cannon*, [so there's only] *one [button* to] *fire* all [your] *weapons* with. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As mentioned, *"R-Type"'s* levels [feature] some [*outrageously* innovative *design*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *<Third::3rd>* Level (one [of] *my* favorites) is *simply* this [enormous *battleship*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya *slowly* fly *by* it, [and] you [need to take out the] various, uh, cannons covering the thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Engines fire off [jet] *thrusters* [at] you, pieces break *off*, the ship tries [to] *crush you* [between] *itself* [and] the *ground*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Eventually*, the Weak [Spot is] *exposed*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [*This* is] a real *tour* de *force* of [*Shooter*] level design. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *difficulty slowly* ramps *up* in "R-Type". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 By *Level <Four::4>*, [you're] having [to] deal [with] more [and] more enemies, *especially* ones [that] come [at] you *from behind*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] fire off [your] *force* [and] then reattach [it to the] back [of your] ship. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *this leaves* [your] *front* open [for] *damage*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Knowing when* [to] move [your] *force* [from *back* to *front* or] vice versa is *one [of* the] keys [to getting *through* this] game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 R-Type II 🇯🇵 ✨

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1988 June 3 🇯🇵 // 1989 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: IREM | Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [when] *we saw* the box [art] a *moment* ago there were *two* Japanese covers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That's] because "R-Type" was [released] in *two pieces*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Levels <One::1> [to] *<Four::4>* were on *one* card, released in *March*, then Levels <Five::5> [to] <Eight::8> on [the] *second* card, which came [out in] June [and] was [titled] "R-Type *<Two::II>*" (no [relation to] the actual *sequel* [to] "R-Type"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *HuCards* only held [about] <two::2> [Megabits of data, at that] *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, the [*capacity*] of HuCards was *increased* (eventually), [and] by the time "R-Type" [was released in] the *U.S.*, the whole thing fit [onto] one *<Four::4> Megabit* card. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, *Japanese* gamers [received] a *password* [at] the end of [Part] *<One::I>* [and entered it] into Part <Two::II> [to] *continue*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] one example when *U.S.* gamers [got] the [better] *deal*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *"R-Type" also* makes good use [of] the P.C. Engine's widescreen *resolution*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The *one* visual *compromise* {is} [that the] screen [is vertically] *narrower* [than] the *Arcade* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Thus*, [there's] a [bit of vertical] *scrolling* required [to get] the entire *game* field in. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Like I *said, this game* gets *really tough* [in the second] half! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This level is] a *killer*, [with all these crate-like] *objects* moving [around the] *maze*-like *passages*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They [can *only*] be [destroyed] by [shooting] the purple *Weak* [Spot], so [if one] comes [at ya from the] wrong [*direction*] (like ya saw a [*moment*] ago) and [ya can't get outta] the way, [you're] *toast*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This *boss* is also an exercise in *misdirection*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Ignore* those things [*shooting* at] you, [and instead concentrate] on [the little] guy [on the right]-hand side of the *screen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Incidentally, [*that*] boss was added [to the] P.C. Engine *version*; {it} [wasn't in] the original *Arcade* game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *bosses* are all based around *finding* [and] attacking the *Weak* Spot [and] all [can] be [pretty] easy if ya find the correct *technique*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {On} the f...ss -- *final* boss, [for example, ya just], uh, [*sit*] right in the *center* [on] the left-hand *side* to avoid *damage*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When [his] *face* is [*exposed*, you] fire off your *force* [and] then go [to] *town*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [However], this *does* demonstrate one thing [*about*] "R-Type"; it's *[quite] doable* if you're fully powered [up]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If *not*, [it could] be a *[lot] harder* - bordering on [*impossible*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, [ya] lose all [your] *power-ups* when ya *die* [and] *power-ups [don't] come too frequently*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This isn't "Blazing *Lazers*" where power-ups appear every two seconds. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Surviving without] the force *can be [pretty] difficult*, so the key is [*not* to] *die*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alright], so [I've defeated] the evil alien Empire ['*forever*', according to the *text*] scroll. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *That's* a lie. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then *here comes* all [these other] *ships*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Where [were] these guys *earlier*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game [would've been] a [lot] easier [if] I had [some] *backup*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well *anyway, "R-Type"* is a *rare example* [of] a *[virtually] perfect Arcade* [port] - *something really* [not] *seen* too much on *consoles* [until this] *point*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Think* [about it]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [was, I] guess, "Donkey Kong *Jr.*" [and] "Bubble [Bobble" on] the *FamiCom*, "Wonder Boy" [on] the Master System, maybe also "*Fantasy* Zone". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But *"R-Type"* took] the *experience* [of] playing an *Arcade* game on a *console* to a *whole* new *level - indisputably* the *high* point of the P.C. Engine's first [eight months]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 YouYou Jinsei 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1988 April 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here we go! "YouYou *Jinsei*" (a.k.a. "Victory *Life*"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} got [some pretty] *classy music* here! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [is this] a sequel [to] "Victory Run"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, no, [not really]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] a *video* game version of the classic *Board* Game, "The Game [of] Life". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You] know, the one where ya move around a board making money, buying insurance, having a family, [and] then retiring [at] the end? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well, in] Japan, video games *based* on this game were *[surprisingly] popular*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the *second* such game we've *seen* (the [first] being "Tetsudou Ou: FamiCom Boardgame" by *dB-SOFT*, seen in "Chrontendo ... <Twenty-*Six*::26>"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [However, *that*] game [was] merely, [sort] of, *inspired* by "The Game of Life". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "YouYou *Jinsei*" is [an] *official* release. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And you] may [have noticed] the *copyright* [to] the Japanese toy company *Takara* on the [*title*] screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *many*, many *follow*-ups to this game have been released [in] Japan, *mostly* by Takara *themselves*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] those [of] you familiar [with] "The Game of Life", you know [what this is] all about. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [start] by choosing a *character* [and] *car color*; [then ya] head [out on] one of two *career* paths. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You spin a wheel [to determine] the number of *moves*; landing on [certain] squares will *trigger both* good [and] bad *events*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, you [can deposit] money in the bank then later take it out {to} get more money. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here*, I'm getting *married*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Later], you'll buy a *house* [and] have some *kids*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *game* keeps track [of your] *finances* as you go *along*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Among* the various things [that can] occur, [well], you can buy *insurance* {to} protect ya from catastrophic events (like *fires*), you [can invest] money in stocks, [and (of] *course*) you [can] *gamble*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "YouYou Jinsei" is *very* much a game of *luck*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, of course, the question is, "*Why drop* <fifty *dollars*::$50> on a *video* game when you can simply pull [out] the actual *Board* Game?". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well], I guess [that's sort] of a question ya hafta [ask about] *all* video games based on Board Games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, I [*will*] say [that] Hudson did go all out when [it] came to the [production] values [on] this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's lots of cute animated cutscenes, catchy music; [the] music [in] this is actually [pretty] *good*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *whole thing* is [quite] *charming*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And it] *takes* [sorta *advantage*] of the P.C. Engine's *multi*-tap *expansion* [which] *allowed* [ya to connect up to] five controllers [at] *once*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [while, in] *some ways*, it's [not] a very *ambitious* game, "YouYou Jinsei" is [at] {the} *very least* [an] amusing *diversion*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On the [*negative*] side, you [tend to get] tired [pretty] *quickly* of watching the damn *wheel* spinning around over [and] over [and] *over* again. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the animations [of the] cars driving around is [not that] convincing, *especially* when you go around *corners* [and the] cars somehow, sort of, move *diagonally*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, someone [gets] a big [payout from] the bank. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I also [mentioned] the *gambling* parts. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's one [of] them [right] here, [for] example. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Place your bets on what number [will] come up and... [didn't] do so well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One [cute little] thing is [that] there's always, [sort of], flying [objects] flying [around]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's, [like, little animated] clouds [floating] around. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll see U.F.O.s, witches, airplanes, birds, all kinds [of cute] things. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [this is not] a [bad] game, [but] I do [sorta] wish [for something] more [substantial] from the P.C. Engine. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pro Yakyuu World Stadium 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1988 May 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Namco 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [only] game [released] in May is *this* one (the [second] game [from] *Namco*) "Pro Yakyuu World *Stadium*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yep*! It's a *Baseball Game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Every console has [to] have a Baseball video game released in the first *year*, [but] this seems somehow... [*familiar*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Wait a second*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This* looks [just like] "Pro Yakyuu *Family* Stadium", [the] Baseball Game *Namco* [put out for] the *FamiCom* [in <Nineteen-Eighty]-Six::1986>! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's the [exact] same intro [and] *everything*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] Namco [already released this] game a *second* time as "Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium <[Eighty]-*Seven*::'87>"! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] now they're [releasing it] *again* as "Pro Yakyuu *World Stadium*"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Take a look* [at this] thing! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [the] same darn *game*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} plays [exactly] like the *other two* games! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay! "Family Stadium" sold a gang [of] *copies*, so I guess Namco [couldn't resist putting out] a *new* version [for] the *P.C.* Engine. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *what's* the *difference*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, the *music's* [better], for *one*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} P.C. Engine's [superior] *sound* chips [improve the original] *sound*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And there're now *somewhat* goofy-sounding *speech* samples. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The graphics [are] more *colorful*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*field*] is [not just] one shade of *green*, [but] now [it's] *three* shades of *green*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *aside* from *looking* [and] *sounding* a [little better, it] *plays* [about] the *same*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I still [hate] the *fielding* [in this] game [and your fielders] move so *slowly*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, while Namco seems {to} be supporting the P.C. *Engine* [at an] early *stage*, all three Namco *games* [this] episode are *ports*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And they [haven't really seemed to yet invest] the *time* in [an original] *game* for this system. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Still, I guess [ya can't] blame ['em for] *hedging* their *bets* - [putting out] games [for the] P.C. Engine [but not] actually [*putting] too* much *money* into [it]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess [it] makes *sense*, since the P.C. Engine was [an] unproven *console*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [if ya] ever [wanted to] play a [better]-looking version of "R.B.I. *Baseball*", [this is] the *game*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Power League 🇯🇵 // World Class Baseball 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1988 June 24 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And some *more* [great] opening music from Hudson. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Do ya know [what] the P.C. Engine needs? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A Baseball Game! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Wait]; we just had one? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, then how [about] *another* Baseball Game? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Power [League]" - the first [in] Hudson's *semi*-long running Baseball series. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (I [*believe*] the [*last*] game was, uh, for... the *PlayStation*.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] was the [*only*] game in the 'Power League' series [to] be released *in* the United States. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 N.E.C. [put it out for] the <Turbo-Graphics-*Sixteen*::TurboGrafx-16> under the more generic-sounding [title], "*World* Class *Baseball*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Sadly*, the *U.S. version* [got] some rather uninspiring *cover* art, *especially* compared to the *Japanese* cover, [which] *has* {to} be one [of] the *coolest* looking pieces of video game *box* art *we've seen*, so *far*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well] *anyway*, "Power League" has the standard *play* options <Two::2>-Player Versus Mode, a Pennant Mode (where ya get [to] play one team after the *other*), Single Game Mode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *All* the teams [are] *fictional* {and} have *[pretty] stupid* names, like the 'Togas' [and] the 'Fries'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The names [are just as] weird [in] the *Japanese* version [with] names like '*Fiber*' [and '*Butter*']. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *As [ya* can] see, "*Power* League" is a realistically-styled *Baseball* Game, *as* opposed to the more cartoonish "Family *Stadium*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} *plays* roughly like every other Baseball Game we've *seen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] move [your batter] *around a bit*, press a [button to] swing, though using *Left* or *Right* on the *D-Pad* while *swinging* [will affect] the *strength* of the swing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And ya seem [to need to, sort of], swing a [little] earlier [than] in [most] games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the [*trickiest* part (when] playing the [*computer*]) is [the tendency for the] pitcher [to] throw these *crazy curveballs* [that] *look like* they're coming [right] down the *middle* [and] then *veer off* [at] the [last] moment. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Pitching* uses the s... -- now, sort of, [standard] method of using the *D-Pad* [to] make a [*fast*], *slow*, [or] *curvy* pitch. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *As* always, *fielding* [tends to] be the [trickiest] part. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Heck! [It] seems whenever a Sports Game has you controlling [a] group of *multiple players*, [it can get] a [little] awkward. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Probably* the [oddest] thing about "Power League", *as* ya may have *noticed*, is the [straight]-down viewpoint [used for fielding], as you see *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Let's] face [it]; this is actually, uh, [pretty] darn ugly! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And it's] a *rather weird decision*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But *other [than that]* "*Power League*" is a [pretty slick] game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, for] the [most] part, the [best-looking] Baseball Game we've covered so *far* ([not that there's really] been *too* much *competition*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing* [that] does look a [little] *weird* [in] this game is the way the [batters] *hold* the *baseball* [bat] before they *swing*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *According* [to] <mag-weasel-[dot]-*com*::magweasel.com>, that's an actual real-life popular Japanese [batting] stance. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But], these [eccentricities] *aside, "Power* League", *altogether*, presents a [*pretty*] nice *package*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sengoku Mahjong 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1988 July 8 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There *always* has [to] be a Mahjong Game! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} sure Hudson did [not] want [to alienate] the huge number of Mahjong fans *[out] there, so* we have "Sengoku Mahjong". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] *seems* {to} be Hudson's first Mahjong *Game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As the name *indicates*, the [*setting*] is the Sengoku period of *Japan* - the 'Warring *States*' period, when a number of powerful warlords [battled] for *supremacy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] ended around <Sixteen-*Hundred*::1600>, when Japan was *unified* under the *Tokugawa* Shogunate. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *game* lets ya play [as] various *figures* [from] the Sengoku *period*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} [has] some nicely [illustrated and animated] depictions [of] these *figures*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Despite* being a Mahjong Game, *Hudson clearly* [put some] extra *effort* [into giving this game] a [bit of] character. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] *game itself* seems {to} be, [sort] of, the typical <Four::4>-Player *Mahjong*, [as] far [as] I [can] *tell*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Interestingly*, the *Mahjong tiles* are [*different* from] those [in] "*Shanghai*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [would've] *assume* they [would've] simply reused the same *sprites*; but, *no*, the tiles [have] all been *redrawn*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *I'm [gonna]* guess [that's] one [important] *feature* of a Mahjong *Game* - [to be able to] read the tiles *clearly* [without getting] a headache. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As I've [mentioned] before, I [don't] have enough knowledge of Mahjong [to actually rate] how well this game *plays*, but [at] least it's nice-*looking*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Galaga '88 🇯🇵 // Galaga '90 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1988 July 15 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Namco 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Namco 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Our] final game, this time *around*, ([and] also the last game of July <Nineteen-[Eighty]-Eight::1988>) is another [from] *Namco* - a port of "Galaga <[Eighty]-*Eight*::'88>". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or is [it] "GaLAGa"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Who knows*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's like "*GRADEius*" or "*GRAWdius*" or "*GRADius*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe [it's supposed] {to} be "GaLAWga". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyhoo! "Galaga [<Eighty-Eight::'88>"] is the *fourth* game in the 'Galaxian'/'Galaga' *series*, [and] the [last] game [in] the original series - [before] the modern reboots occurred, like the oddball "Galaxian *<Three::III>"* ([which is] one [of] those crazy gigantic arcade *ride-like* games), *or* the recent "Galaga *Legions*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here's* the original Arcade version, *here* - [released] in <Nineteen-Eighty-*Seven*::1987>. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The *little* animated] talking aliens are [*one of*] the things [that] were [cut out for the] home *version*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], of course, [this] has a more [vertically-orientated] screen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 N.E.C. released "Galaga <[Eighty]-Eight::'88>" for the <*Turbo*-Graphics::TurboGrafx> [in] the U.S. in *<Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] thus {the} title [was] changed to "Galaga *<Ninety::'90>"*, because *"Galaga* [<Eighty-Eight::'88>"] would [not exactly] sound [cutting]-edge in [<Nineteen-Eighty-*Nine*::1989>]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Other [than the] name, *nothing* was changed [that] I *know* of. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, one [distinct feature] of "Galaga [<Eighty-Eight::'88>"] was [the] choice of either single [or] double ships. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The double [ship allowed ya to sorta] pick off enemies much *faster*, [at] the risk of being a bigger *target*, as you saw [just] {a} few minutes ago. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In earlier games, you [could get] a [second] ship by allowing [an enemy to] suck up [your] ship [with its] *tractor* beam (in essence, losing a *life*), then [*shooting* it with] a [*replacement*] ship, causing [it to] drop the [*original*] ship - which [would] then dock [next to your] ship [and] give you a double ship. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's one [of] the [interesting parts right] here - these whole, sort of, galactic *dancing* segments. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Aliens fly around in [elaborate] dance-[like patterns]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] attempt to [shoot as] many [as possible]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [shooting] all [of them will] give you a *bonus*, [but] if you *don't* fire [and] stay [completely] *still* during [these] segments, you'll [get] the *secret* bonus. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 All [in] all, [however], "Galaga [<Eighty-Eight::'88>"] is, *[sort] of*, very similar [to] the earlier *games*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Aliens fly by [and] land in "Space Invaders"-like formations. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once all the aliens have *landed* [in] *place*, [they'll attack] you by flying down [in little] squadrons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] job: [to shoot 'em] all [and] then move on [to] the [next] level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, there is [an] extra dimension here [not] found in the earlier 'Galaga' *games: [literally] extra dimensions*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you [collect] those two blue *canister* things [before] the galactic *dancing* segment, you'll warp [to] the next *dimension*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This actually* gives you a [bit] more *variety* [in] the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Galaga [<Eighty-Eight::'88>"] is a -- [sort of] a strange game [in] some ways. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] *very nice*-looking [and the little] music [that there] *is* is quite *catchy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] is [definitely, however], one [of] the [first attempts at, sort of, creating] a [deliberately] retro-style game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *previous* ['Galaga'] game [hit] arcades [in] <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Four*::1984>. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [However], by *this* time (<[Nineteen-Eighty]-Seven::1987>), Namco [was creating] *much more* [elaborate] games, [such as] "Shadow Land". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [Shooters were then becoming, like], much more [complicated] affairs [with] all kinds of power-ups, bosses, [and] *so on*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 By [*creating*] a game [that's really just, sort] of, a riff on "*Space* Invaders", Namco [was sorta] saying, 'Hey! [Remember] when video games were all simple [and] fun?'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And that's what] "Galaga [<Eighty-Eight::'88>"] *is*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Granted, I [sort] of wish they had had some more *music* in it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Much [of] the game plays [out with] sound effects [only]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] overall I'd [rate] "Galaga <[Eighty]-Eight::'88>" as a [success]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 1 Wrap Up ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, there ya *have it*, the debut of the P.C. *Engine*, [and] what a *fantastic-looking* system [it] *is*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Sega, Nintendo - you guys* [better get] *on* it! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, *Sega* would do [exactly *that*] when the *Mega* Drive [was released in] October of <Nineteen-[Eighty]-Eight::1988>. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo would [continue to ride the success of] the FamiCom [for *quite*] a *while*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [it *will*] be a [while] before the [next] "*Chronturbo...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But "...Episode *<Two::2>"* [will] cover the [second] half [of <Nineteen-Eighty]-Eight::1988>, [including the] very first C.D.-*ROM* games. 🍇🍌
