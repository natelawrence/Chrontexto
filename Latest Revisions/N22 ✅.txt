👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 22 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, folks, 🍋 'Chrontendo' is back 🍊 and today we are 🍋 going to go through 🍊 the entire month 🍋 of September 1987 - 🍊 [only] three months 🍋 before we hit 1988. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Big news in September is 🍋 the emergence of Atlas 🍋 as a developer to watch 🍊 and the release of a 🍋 fantastically different game 🍋 from Culture Brain. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And a huge chunk of bonus 🍋 content this time around 🍊 as we take a look 🍋 at Computer Games 🍊 (or at least Western 🍋 Computer Games) in 1987. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, first up, let's 🍋 finish up August 1987. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Photon: The Ultimate Game on Planet Earth 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 28 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Takara
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Takara 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you might not 🍋 have known it, but 🍊 "Chrontendo Episode 21" 🍋 was a cliffhanger episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We left off with 🍊 "Transformers: 🍋 The Head Masters" 🍋 from Takara. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you were 🍋 doubtlessly wondering, 🍊 'What sort of amazing 🍋 stuff will Takara 🍋 come up with next?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, the wait is over 🍊 because Takara released 🍋 two games that same day. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So we pick up on 🍋 August 28th with 🍊 "Photon: 🍋 The Ultimate Game 🍋 On Planet Earth". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, "Photon..." is 🍋 "the ultimate game 🍋 on planet Earth"; 🍊 it says so 🍋 right in the subtitle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you know this 🍋 has gotta be good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, you can't lie 🍋 in a video game title 🍋 now, can you? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So wow! 🍊 We've got these 🍋 crazy 3D graphics! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character is trapped 🍋 in this underground maze, 🍊 under constant attack 🍋 from these little aliens 🍊 that whizz by your head. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And you need to 🍋 collect items 🍊 (not cool items, mind you, 🍋 - no Ice Ray here, folks). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No, you need items like 🍊 the Loader, the Counter, 🍋 the Marker, and Discs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Wow! That's kind of lame. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, for some reason, 🍊 the aliens all make these 🍋 completely inappropriate, 🍊 like, vintage Arcade Game 🍋 sound effects. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there actually 🍋 is one cool item - 🍊 the Yellow Stone. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This allows you 🍋 to move up and down 🍋 the vertical passageways 🍊 that connect the game's 🍋 seven or so levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By the way, 🍋 the Discs that you collect 🍊 simply have 🍋 little hints in them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, admittedly, 🍊 the, uh, attempt to 🍋 make 3D maze games, uh, 🍊 sometimes falls a bit 🍋 short of the mark 🍊 (and that's 🍋 certainly true here). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 It uses backgrounds 🍋 drawn using perspective 🍊 but, uh, as you 🍋 move forward, 🍊 the static background 🍋 is simply replaced 🍊 by [a] black screen 🍋 for a second, 🍊 and then the next 🍋 background appears. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no attempt 🍋 to make it appear 🍊 as if the walls 🍋 were actually moving, 🍊 and your sprite 🍋 remains the same size 🍊 as you walk into 🍋 the background. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, the enemy sprites 🍋 do get bigger 🍋 as they approach. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And combat 🍋 can sometimes be 🍊 obnoxiously tough 🍋 with certain enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can [only] fire 🍋 straight ahead, 🍊 so not much aiming 🍋 is really possible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the hit detection is 🍋 sometimes kinda weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies can touch you 🍋 and do damage, 🍊 even though they 🍋 are supposed to be 🍊 at the other end 🍋 of the hall. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, despite all this, 🍋 "Photon..." is, you know, 🍊 "...The Ultimate Game 🍋 On Planet Earth", 🍊 which makes 🍋 [pretty] much every game 🍋 released after this one 🍊 completely redundant. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So I guess there's 🍋 really no point 🍊 in continuing the 🍋 series any further. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I hope you enjoyed it; 🍋 thanks for watching. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🍓 Thank you for watching 🍋 "Chrontendo 🍋 Episode 22". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, not really, I guess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll keep going for 🍋 just a little while, 🍊 just to see if anything 🍋 else interesting pops up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose everything will 🍋 seem a bit anticlimactic 🍊 after "Photon: 🍋 The Ultimate Game 🍋 On Planet Earth", 🍊 but maybe 🍋 we'll come across 🍊 something interesting 🍋 eventually. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Trainer: Manhattan Police 🇯🇵 // Street Cop 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 31 🇯🇵 // 1989 June [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it's time 🍋 for yet another 🍋 'Family Trainer' game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This time around, we have 🍊 "Family Trainer: 🍋 Manhattan Police". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By now, we find that Bandai 🍋 has moved away from 🍊 the Sports and 🍋 Exercise-themed titles, 🍊 and is now focusing 🍋 more on Action Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here ya play one of 🍋 New York City's finest, 🍊 out to rid the 🍋 streets of crime. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo had 🍋 been releasing, uh, 🍊 some of the 🍋 Power Pad games 🍋 themselves in the U.S., 🍊 but for this one, 🍋 they decided not to touch it, 🍊 leaving Bandai to 🍋 put it out themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the U.S., 🍋 they released it under 🍋 the name of "Street Cop". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess the red and green 🍋 color scheme 🍊 seemed a little garish, 🍋 so they changed it to 🍊 sort of, like, 🍋 a boring back alley 🍋 background here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Incidentally, this was 🍋 the last of Bandai's 🍋 'Family Trainer' games 🍊 to be released in the U.S. 🍊 (having come out, 🍋 oh, around mid 1989) 🍊 but it certainly was not 🍋 the last 'Family Trainer' 🍋 game in Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the plot 🍋 is [quite] simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to bust 🍋 a series of criminals 🍊 that range 🍋 from pickpockets 🍋 to Mob bosses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each one has 🍋 their own level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to 🍋 take on a series of 🍋 henchmen underlings 🍊 before the boss, 🍋 himself, appears. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Much like the last 🍋 'Family Trainer' game 🍊 (which we saw, like, 🍋 two episodes ago) 🍊 this involves somewhat 🍋 more complicated controls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You not [only] have to 🍋 run on the Power Pad, 🍊 but you need to move 🍋 your character vertically 🍊 (that is up and down), 🍊 make 90 degree turns 🍋 to go around corners 🍊 and make a 180° turn 🍋 to reverse direction. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can also use items 🍋 and swing your nightstick. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Street Cop" 🍋 law enforcement 🍋 primarily consists of 🍊 running up to suspicious-🍋looking individuals 🍊 and beating them 🍋 into submission. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can also throw 🍋 a Coke can at them 🍊 (though I'm not really sure 🍋 if this follows 🍊 normal New York City 🍋 Police policies). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, in Central Park 🍋 (that last episode, there) 🍊 uh, muggers tend to hide 🍋 in those red things 🍊 (which I assume 🍋 are wastebaskets(?) - 🍊 if so, they're 🍋 inconveniently tall). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The levels do 🍋 get more complex 🍋 as the game progresses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The second level 🍋 takes place in a 🍋 severely rundown Harlem 🍊 (parts of which were 🍋 actually in [pretty] bad 🍋 shape in the 1980s). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, yes, and also make sure 🍋 you don't fall down 🍋 any manholes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like the other 🍋 Human-developed 🍋 'Family Trainer' games, 🍊 "Street Cop" is 🍋 [pretty] well done 🍊 (assuming, of course, that 🍋 you don't have any issues 🍊 with the rather, 🍋 uh, gimmickiness 🍋 of the controls). 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Arabian Dream Scheherazade 🇯🇵 // Magic of Scheherazade 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 03 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Culture Brain | Micro Academy
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Culture Brain 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We kick off September 1987 🍋 with a bang (a huge bang!) 🍊 with this extremely 🍋 creative and unusual game 🍋 from Culture Brain: 🍊 "Arabian Dream 🍋 Scheherazade". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On the title screen, note 🍋 the name 'Micro Academy'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was some 🍋 sort of internal 🍋 development company 🍊 whose name appears on a 🍋 few Culture Brain games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You might recall 🍋 Culture Brain 🍊 from earlier 🍋 FamiCom titles, 🍊 "Super Chinese" 🍋 and "Hiryu no Ken" 🍊 (a.k.a. "Flying Dragon: 🍋 ...Secret Scroll"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Both were not very good, 🍋 but, uh, sort of original. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Arabian Dream..." 🍋 ups the ante considerably. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In brief, it's a 🍋 "...Zelda"-like R.P.G., 🍊 but goes far beyond 🍋 any other similar games, 🍋 up to this point. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for you 🍋 old-school N.E.S. fans, 🍊 this is a game 🍋 you know as 🍊 "Magic of Scheherazade". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Culture Brain, unlike 🍋 many small Japanese 🍋 video game companies, 🍊 had a U.S. division 🍋 and the game was reworked, 🍊 uh, given a very 🍋 good translation, 🍊 and released in 🍋 the U.S. in 1989. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First off, the music has 🍋 been improved quite a bit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the plot 🍋 involves an amnesic 🍋 time-traveling wizard, 🍊 whose girlfriend 🍋 was kidnapped 🍊 by an evil wizard, 🍋 named Sabaron. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At the start, you choose 🍋 one of three classes: 🍊 a Magician, 🍋 Fighter, 🍋 or Saint - 🍊 standard R.P.G. stuff, 🍋 but not normally seen 🍊 in Japanese R.P.G.s, 🍋 at this time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You could even 🍋 change classes 🍋 throughout the game 🍊 and, in fact, 🍋 you'll probably have to. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the beginning 🍋 plops you down 🍊 in the typical R.P.G. town 🍋 with a shop, a motel, 🍊 and various N.P.C.s 🍋 to offer up suggestions 🍋 as to what to do next. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, you'll 🍋 note some features 🍊 not found in other 🍋 FamiCom games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, when you 🍋 go into the shop, 🍊 you can actually attempt to 🍋 bargain with a shopkeeper 🍋 at your risk. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, of course, 🍋 if he doesn't like you, 🍊 he'll actually charge 🍋 you a bit of money 🍊 and kick you out 🍋 without your items. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can even 🍋 take out loans, 🍊 which you'll need 🍋 to pay back later. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as you've 🍋 probably noticed, 🍊 comparing this to 🍋 the footage we saw 🍊 just a second ago, 🍋 of the Japanese version, 🍊 there have been 🍋 some changes made, 🍊 uh, with the 🍋 character sprites. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, the 🍋 googly-eyed main character 🍋 looks a bit different and 🍊 there have been, sort of, 🍋 subtle changes made 🍋 to all the N.P.C.s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the shopkeepers 🍋 and the various 🍋 character portraits 🍊 of those N.P.C.s 🍋 found inside buildings 🍋 remain the same. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, once out 🍋 on the overworld, 🍊 you'll clearly see 🍋 the barely-concealed 🍋 [similarity] to "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But "...Scheherazade" is 🍋 not content to merely 🍋 be a "...Zelda" clone. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you do find 🍋 various hidden doors 🍋 on the overworld. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You uncover them by using 🍋 (in the U.S. version, 🍋 your spell 'Oprin'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the Japanese version, 🍋 ya buy items to open doors. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But we also 🍋 have time travel. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each level has a hidden 🍋 door that allows you [to] 🍊 go into the future or 🍋 the past, as needed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, uh, 🍊 the city you need to 🍋 go to flooded years ago. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you travel 🍋 back in time 50 years 🍊 and find the city 🍋 before it flooded. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Each level is similar, 🍋 but with, uh, 🍊 various differences 🍋 at different points in time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you can actually use 🍋 this to your advantage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, you can 🍋 plant a Rupia tree seed 🍊 in the past 🍋 in the magic field. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I just found the entrance 🍋 to the magic field here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It takes years to grow, 🍊 but if we return to the 🍋 same spot in the future, 🍊 you'll find the 🍋 tree fully grown 🍊 and you'll be 🍋 able to harvest 🍊 tons of money 🍋 off the tree. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Yeah, I know, 🍋 a tree that grows money - 🍊 that seems [pretty] strange... 🍊 but there are a lot of 🍋 weird trees in this game.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yes, there are also, 🍋 uh, solar eclipses, 🍊 which provide 🍋 various advantages 🍊 as, for example, when ya 🍋 can plant the Rupia seed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or ya can use 🍋 the great magic spells, 🍊 which are major 🍋 magical spells that 🍋 can be used [only] once. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another unusual feature: 🍋 there are universities 🍊 from which you can 🍋 learn the great spells, 🍊 as well as 🍋 different battle formations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, universities 🍋 will provide you with 🍊 a weapons upgrade after 🍋 taking certain courses. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 These formations, 🍋 seen here, 🍊 are helpful when ya fight 🍋 certain groups of enemies, 🍊 and allow ya to combine 🍋 your, uh, characters' magic 🍋 to perform special attacks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Yep! So we have time travel 🍋 and the special attacks; 🍊 those make 🍋 "...Scheherazade" seem like 🍊 an early ancestor 🍋 to "Chrono Trigger". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, while we've 🍋 seen FamiCom games 🍊 imitate "...Zelda" 🍋 and "Dragon Quest", 🍊 "...Scheherazade" is 🍋 basically the first 🍊 [to] take everything 🍋 from both games, 🍊 mash them all together, 🍊 and then add a bunch 🍋 of other stuff as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's both an Action R.P.G. 🍋 and a Turn-Based R.P.G.. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya fight "...Zelda"-style 🍋 overworld battles 🍊 and random 🍋 turn-based battles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These battles [resemble] 🍊 "Dragon Quest II"-🍋style battles 🍊 but are a bit 🍋 more involved. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's more spells and 🍋 they include various sorts 🍊 of status spells 🍋 and combo spells. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, 🍋 each level contains 🍊 underground mazes 🍋 (seen here). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These kinda resemble 🍋 those of "Dragon Quest", 🍊 whereas there's also 🍋 various castles 🍊 that are more like 🍋 "...Zelda"'s dungeon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Each level ends 🍋 with a boss battle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Choosing the 🍋 Magician class 🍊 will make the boss battles 🍋 seem a lot easier 🍊 because [you] have 🍋 your ranged weapon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The rod is 🍋 much more powerful 🍋 when you're a Magician. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So what are ya actually 🍋 doing in the mazes? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, often, uh, you're 🍋 looking for other 🍊 playable characters 🍋 to join your party. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, for example, 🍊 I'm looking for 🍋 this flying monkey 🍊 who is required to 🍋 navigate a desert. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 How many characters 🍋 are there? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, aside from the 🍋 main character, eleven. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Compare that to 🍋 "Dragon Quest"'s two. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's like playing 🍊 "Romancing Saga" or 🍋 something like that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the game has a often 🍋 very quirky sense of humor. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍊 we visited the city in 🍋 the past before it flooded. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One old guy said 🍊 he was never gonna 🍋 budge from his spot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you visit it in 🍋 the present, post-flood, 🍊 he's still there - 🍋 living underwater. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And your characters 🍋 are all quite kooky - 🍊 genies, 🍋 a robot named Gun Meca, 🍊 a living doll 🍋 made of a pumpkin, 🍊 a greedy guy named Mustafa, 🍋 a shrimp named Rainey. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The personalities are 🍋 reasonably well-defined, 🍊 as seen in these 🍋 cutscenes here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They're actually 🍋 quite charming. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 All this crazy 🍋 stuff in the game - 🍊 but, you know, 🍋 there's actually more. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can find hidden shops 🍊 to hire troopers 🍋 to assist you 🍊 in the 🍋 turn-based battles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These guys fight 🍋 in groups of four 🍊 and this is actually 🍋 mostly what you need 🍊 the money from 🍋 the Rupia tree for. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These guys get 🍋 stronger and stronger 🍊 as the game progresses 🍋 and can do serious damage 🍊 (not to mention, soak up 🍋 a lot of, uh, damage 🍋 meant for the party). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As in all Japanese 🍋 R.P.G.s of this era, 🍊 you can't choose specifically 🍋 which enemy to hit, 🍊 so your characters, sort of, 🍋 hit enemies at random. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'll note that on these 🍋 turn-based battle sequences, 🍊 all of the enemies have 🍋 been completely redesigned 🍋 for the U.S. version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think in the 🍋 Japanese version, 🍊 they tend to look 🍋 a little weirder, 🍊 where in the U.S. version, 🍋 they sort of look 🍊 a little bit more 🍋 comic booky. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Out of your party, 🍊 you can choose up to three 🍋 characters for each battle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They all have, sort of, 🍊 ...have their different 🍋 strengths and weaknesses; 🍊 some are strong physically, 🍊 whereas others have 🍋 powerful magic attacks 🍊 and others are 🍋 kind of useless. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Some of the 🍋 special formation spells 🍊 are actually quite insane 🍋 - Moniburn for example. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It will transform the 🍋 enemies into rockets, 🍊 which will then fly up 🍋 and blow themselves up, 🍊 causing instant death. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is 🍋 completely hardcore. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And some of the enemies 🍋 are a little weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And one boss (this one) 🍊 is actually very badly 🍋 translated as 'Curly'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Stupid name', ya think, 🍋 until you see the boss 🍊 and realize she's 🍋 supposed to be Kali. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As we'll see in 🍋 another game this episode, 🍊 Japanese games designers 🍋 seem quite fond of 🍊 throwing in gods 🍋 from other cultures. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The bosses all tend 🍋 to have two forms - 🍊 some sort of special 🍋 spell or ac... activity 🍊 is required to bring 🍋 out the second form. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In Hindu iconography, 🍋 Kali is sometimes depicted 🍋 as a peaceful goddess, 🍊 and sometimes as 🍋 a battle-frenzied 🍋 and much scarier goddess 🍊 and often she 🍋 has four arms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hmm... Four arms? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, so much 🍋 for accuracy here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another very 🍋 cool-looking boss 🍊 is this guy: Salamander. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, why is a gigantic fire 🍋 monster called 'Salamander'? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll actually 🍋 discuss that 🍊 in another game, 🍋 later this episode. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, while the 🍋 Action-based combat can 🍋 sometimes be troublesome, 🍊 the boss battles can be 🍋 either too simplistic 🍋 or just plain infuriating. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Salamander rises up 🍋 for a few seconds, 🍊 ya shoot at him, 🍊 he'll then hide 🍋 behind his Fire Field 🍊 (you'll need Rainy 🍋 to cast a spell to 🍋 bring him back out again) 🍊 and then ya repeat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However if Rainy 🍋 runs out of Magic Points 🍊 before ya s... 🍋 defeats Salamander, 🍊 I mean you're 🍋 [pretty] much S.O.L. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The thing is, you do 🍋 have magic refill items 🍊 ([the] thing that 🍋 looks like a glass 🍊 in the lower 🍋 right-hand corner). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I had five of them 🍋 while fighting Salamander, 🍊 but the thing is, 🍊 they can [only] 🍋 be used automatically 🍊 when you run out of magic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can't use them manually. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, for some reason, 🍋 Rainy will never use one 🍊 to replenish his Magic 🍋 in this sequence. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, sometimes really 🍋 horrible special enemies 🍊 will appear on 🍋 the overworld - 🍊 this Barzil magician, 🍋 for example. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He'll cast Moniburn on you, 🍊 which can 🍋 instantly kill you 🍊 by turning you 🍋 into a rocket. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Trust me; 🍊 these sequences 🍋 will cause you to 🍊 throw your controller in 🍋 anger over and over again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They're like the Eggplant 🍋 Magicians in "Kid Icarus" 🍊 but much much worse. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, once you 🍋 actually find Sarabon, 🍊 [it] turns out ya 🍋 don't fight him! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nope! Ya talk to him 🍋 and it is revealed 🍊 that he's unleashed 🍋 a evil force 🍊 more powerful 🍋 than himself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's actually 🍋 a little plot twist 🍊 that I certainly had 🍋 no idea that was coming. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, another rather bad 🍋 decision in this game 🍊 is that, just like, 🍋 uh, "Dragon Quest", 🍊 he asks you 🍋 some kind of question 🍊 and if you 🍋 answer incorrectly, 🍊 ya fail the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The answer to this question 🍋 really isn't that difficult. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, ya know, 🍋 it is a bit of a pain 🍊 if you somehow d... 🍋 get the answer wrong - 🍊 it's an instant Game Over. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then the final boss 🍋 is also a bit of a pain, 🍊 due to the fact 🍋 that when he appears, 🍊 you need to actually, 🍋 sort of, stick to the 🍊 lower left-hand 🍋 corner of the screen, 🍊 in ord... order to avoid 🍋 getting eaten by him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You don't really have a 🍋 whole lot of mobility 🍋 in the final boss battle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the main boss' 🍋 second form of 🍋 two rotating spheres 🍊 doesn't really make a 🍋 whole lot of sense 🍊 when ya 🍋 think about it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, all in all, 🍋 "...Scheherazade" is 🍊 one of the most 🍋 ambitious games 🍊 we've seen for 🍋 the FamiCom, so far. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are so many elements: 🍊 time travel, 🍋 the eclipse cycle, 🍊 the huge number of 🍋 items and spells, 🍊 the lack of 🍋 grinding required 🍊 (or at least in 🍋 the U.S. version; 🍊 the Japanese version had, 🍋 uh, higher thresholds 🍋 for Leveling Up) 🍊 there was the large number 🍋 of playable characters, 🍊 the clever way that... 🍋 way that you can 🍊 map spells and actions 🍊 to the controller's 🍋 two buttons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You know, at first, 🍊 I really wondered if this 🍋 is actually from 1987 🍊 or if I had the wrong date. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it turns out 🍋 that "...Scheherazade" 🍋 is simply ahead of its time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned, 🍋 there are some 🍊 rather hateful moments 🍋 in this game, 🍊 but overall, 🍋 it's very well balanced 🍊 and to see this appear 🍋 out of nowhere in 1987 🍊 from a company 🍋 like Culture Brain 🍊 (with a rather 🍋 sketchy history) 🍊 is surprising 🍋 to say the least 🍊 (one of the very few 🍋 FamiCom games I've seen 🍊 that, sort of, caught me 🍋 completely off guard 🍊 with its creativity 🍋 and innovation). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So while "...Scheherazade" 🍋 is far from perfect, 🍊 it certainly 🍋 gets massive points 🍊 for breaking away 🍋 from the usual format 🍊 of all these 🍋 Action-based R.P.G.s 🍊 we've been seeing 🍋 on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 FamiCom Mukashi Banashi: Shin Onigashima 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 04 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I mentioned that 🍋 this episode would contain 🍊 a Nintendo game that 🍋 you've never heard of... 🍊 and here it is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Virtually unknown 🍋 outside of Japan, it is 🍊 "FamiCom Mukashi Banashi: 🍋 Shin Onigashima". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Mukashi Banashi' 🍋 basically means 🍋 'Stories of Old Times'; 🍊 the Wikipedia page 🍋 for this game 🍊 [translated] the title as 🍋 "FamiCom Fairy Tales". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Shin Onigashima' means 🍋 'New Demon Island', 🍊 and this finds 🍋 Nintendo headed into 🍋 unknown waters for them, 🍊 since "...Shin Onigashima" 🍋 is a Menu-Based 🍋 Adventure Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was developed by 🍋 Nintendo and Pax Softnica 🍊 with music by Koji Kondo. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, 🍊 note how resolutely 🍋 Japanese this game is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo almost seems 🍋 to be making a statement 🍊 with the design here; 🍊 not a single word 🍋 is written in 🍋 the Roman alphabet. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even the copyright date 🍋 is in Japanese characters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All the text 🍊 is read vertically 🍋 and from right to left, 🍊 and it actually appears 🍋 on these scrolls 🍊 that unroll and 🍋 roll up themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this all 🍋 makes perfect sense, 🍊 since the game is 🍋 based around historic 🍋 Japanese folklore, 🍊 specifically 🍋 the legend of Momotarou, 🍊 (the 'Peach Boy') 🍋 and Taketori Monogatari. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Momotarou, incidentally, 🍋 was later the subject 🍊 of a series of video games 🍋 from Hudson. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So all the, uh, 🍋 unity in design and concept 🍊 is actually 🍋 [pretty] impressive 🍊 (though it does leave us, 🍋 uh, presenting with 🍋 one little problem 🍊 often found in 🍋 games of this sort, 🍊 namely the tiny 🍋 postage-stamp-sized window 🍋 depicting the action itself). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The original, uh, Japanese 🍋 Text Adventure Games, 🍊 uh, were... a lot of 'em were 🍋 on... f... on Computers, 🍊 so it's not surprising 🍊 that we end up 🍋 with a screen layout 🍊 that looks kinda like 🍋 it was originally designed 🍋 for a Computer Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, of course, uh, 🍋 "...Shin Onigashima" 🍊 is notable 🍋 as the first 🍊 Menu-Based Adventure 🍋 Game from Nintendo, 🍊 which shows just how popular 🍋 this genre was becoming. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's also an example of 🍋 Nintendo branching out 🍊 into a genre that was 🍋 [pretty] much established 🍊 by the time 🍋 they got around 🍊 [to] doing their 🍋 own take on it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's really not very common 🍋 for Nintendo to do this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, if you 🍋 think about it, 🍊 other than their 🍋 generic Sports titles, 🍊 Nintendo had mostly 🍋 stuck with Platformers 🍊 and Action-Adventure Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That is, genres 🍋 that they themselves 🍋 helped popularize. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, games based 🍋 on Mario and "...Zelda". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We haven't really seen them 🍊 work much outside 🍋 this comfort zone. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They've really 🍋 done no 🍊 Shoot-'em-Ups, 🍋 Beat-'em-Ups, R.P.G.s, 🍊 War Strategy games, 🍋 Puzzle Games, 🍊 really no games like 🍋 that for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 With "...Shin Onigashima" 🍋 Nintendo was basically 🍊 jumping on the 🍋 "Portopia" train. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, Nintendo 🍋 was not really content 🍊 to make simply 🍋 another murder mystery 🍋 Adventure Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They decided to put 🍋 their own take on it, 🍊 uh, by giving it this 🍋 Japanese folklore setting. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So what's going on here? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, ya know, 🍋 your standard 🍊 Adventure [Game item] menus, 🍋 first of all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your main menu 🍋 is on the bottom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of the time, 🍋 the commands listed 🍊 from right to left are 🍋 Look, Take, Talk, Move 🍋 and Inventory. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this part here 🍋 is just the prologue. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 The woodcutter character 🍊 will eventually find 🍋 the two infants 🍊 that become the game's 🍋 main characters 🍊 (one in a rice bowl and 🍋 then one in a bamboo tree). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One o' the first 🍋 little obstacles here 🍊 is I'm trapped by 🍋 this bear in the woods 🍊 and require the help of 🍋 this odd little fellow 🍊 to get past him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, once the 🍋 main game starts 🍊 and [you] take control 🍋 the two main characters, 🍊 you can switch back and 🍋 forth between them, at will. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The little box, 🍋 right below the image, 🍊 will show you which 🍋 character is equipped 🍊 (though, of course, 🍋 there's nothing there now). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo had a very unusual 🍋 release plan for this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's two discs but was 🍋 released separately - 🍊 one at the beginning 🍋 and then one at the 🍋 end of September. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Note that 🍋 "...Shin Onigashima II" 🍋 is not a sequel; 🍊 it is literally the 🍋 second disc o' the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You will need to reach a 🍋 certain point on Disc 1 🍊 and then actually swap out 🍋 the disc mid-game; 🍊 you can't put in Disc 2 🍋 and just start playing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game was apparently 🍋 [pretty] successful 🍊 and versions for 🍋 the Super FamiCom 🍊 and Game Boy Advance 🍋 were later released. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's also on the Japanese 🍋 [Wii] Virtual Console. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess it 🍋 started a series of 🍊 Menu-Based Adventure Games 🍋 from Nintendo 🍊 that remain mostly 🍋 unseen in the West. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is actually too bad 🍋 'cause, I mean, you know, 🍊 this is actually a [pretty] 🍋 major release from Nintendo, 🍊 and one that will probably 🍊 never be translated 🍋 into English. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, 🍋 you can give... 🍊 you can give it a 🍋 try to play it, 🍊 but it's going to require 🍋 [pretty] heavy-duty 🍋 Japanese skills, 🍊 as far as I can tell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So folks who have [only] 🍋 sort of a basic command 🍊 of video game Japanese 🍋 will probably not have 🍋 much luck with this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Zoids: Chuuou Tairiku no Tatakai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 05 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Micronics
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toshiba EMI 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And going back 🍋 to toy companies, 🍊 one of the Takara's 🍋 main rivals was Tomy, 🍊 who focused more on 🍋 younger children's toys. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I say they *were* rivals 🍊 because they merged 🍋 a few years ago. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At this point, 🍋 Tomy wasn't releasing 🍋 FamiCom games themselves, 🍊 thus "Zoids..." was published 🍋 by Toshiba EMI. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for those of you 🍋 who don't recall, 🍊 "Zoids..." were a 🍋 line of mech toys, 🍊 first released in the 1980s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These mechs were all shaped 🍋 like dinosaurs or animals. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, there were 🍋 spin-off comics and anime 🍊 and the story had something 🍋 to do with, ya know, 🍊 two warring empires... 🍋 blah, blah, blah... 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So that's you there; that's 🍋 your little robot character. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Presumably a spin-off 🍋 video game will be 🍊 an Action Platformer where 🍋 ya battle evil "Zoids..." and... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Wait a minute. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is a 🍋 "Dragon Quest" clone? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That doesn't even 🍋 make any sense! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, first of all, 🍋 I thought the "Zoids..." 🍊 were supposed to be, 🍋 like, these giant robots, 🍊 piloted by little guys 🍋 sitting inside the heads 🍊 but here they're, like, 🍋 ...they're human-sized. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 No, wait a second; 🍋 I was wrong. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest" 🍋 had two guards 🍊 in the throne room, 🍋 not one... 🍊 so this is really nothing 🍋 like "Dragon Quest"! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And actually, no, 🍋 these don't even really 🍋 look like robots! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They look... well, 🍊 I don't know what 🍋 they look like, exactly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, um, I will admit, 🍊 I know nothing whatsoever 🍋 about the 'Zoids' universe. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But this does seem 🍋 [pretty] ridiculous. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, why would 🍋 all these mechs 🍊 be hanging out 🍋 inside of a castle? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, once you're outside, 🍋 this game still looks 🍊 an awful lot like 🍋 "Dragon Quest", 🍊 but there are 🍋 some differences. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, "Zoids..." is 🍋 not a Turn-Based R.P.G.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh sure, ya wander around 🍋 on the overworld, um, 🍊 but it actually more 🍋 resembles an Action R.P.G., 🍋 at this point, 🍊 because the enemies are 🍋 clearly visible on the map. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Remember, at 🍋 this time in Japan, 🍊 Action R.P.G.s are 🍋 actually a lot more common 🍊 than these random-battle 🍋 turn-based "Dragon Quest"-🍋style of, uh, R.P.G.s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, when ya 🍋 run into an enemy, 🍊 you switch to a vaguely 🍋 "Dragon Quest"-like 🍋 first-person view. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can check out 🍋 the enemy's stats 🍋 and your stats. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, like 🍋 any R.P.G. of this era, 🍊 you will almost 🍋 immediately encounter 🍊 enemies way too 🍋 powerful for ya. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And here's the weird thing; 🍊 these battles are done, 🍋 like, "Battlezone"-style. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya turn left and right 🍊 then fire shots off 🍋 at the other "Zoids...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So this game managed to 🍋 somehow rip off 🍊 both "Dragon Quest", 🍋 and "Battlezone", 🍊 which is a [pretty] 🍋 unusual combination 🍊 when you think about it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, here I'm 🍋 taking on enemies 🍊 that're a little 🍋 more at my level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, while "Zoids..." 🍋 barely even qualifies 🍋 as an R.P.G., 🍊 it still has the honor 🍊 of being one of the 🍋 very first games 🍊 that tries to look 🍋 like "Dragon Quest", 🍊 even though it doesn't 🍋 really play like that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as I'm sure 🍋 you weren't wondering, 🍊 yes, this was 🍋 ported to computers 🍊 such as the M.S.X. 2. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, you know how 🍊 the M.S.X. isn't 🍋 very good at scrolling? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, Lord, 🍋 take a look at this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This will 🍋 give you a seizure 🍊 if you watch it 🍋 for too long. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The two versions do seem 🍋 to look very similar, 🍊 almost identical 🍋 (uh, scrolling issues aside). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, back to the lovely-🍋looking FamiCom version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So who is 🍋 responsible for this? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, uh, 🍋 Micronics, it appears. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose this is 🍋 not bad-looking 🍋 for a Micronics game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It does look, you know, 🍋 kind of idiotic, 🍊 but Micronics definitely 🍋 put out uglier games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 How does it work 🍋 as an overall game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it's really 🍋 hard to say, 🍊 but, uh, at least 🍋 it's not your typical 🍋 crappy Platformer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [We've] certainly seen 🍋 enough o' those so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 SWAT 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 11 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bear's
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toei 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Fantastic news, folks. 🍊 You'll remember 🍋 "Hokuto no Ken" 🍊 for the FamiCom, 🍋 of course. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, the folks who 🍋 brought ya that game 🍋 are back for more. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yep! Publisher Toei and 🍋 kusoge masters, Bears, 🍊 have teamed up 🍋 to give you "SWAT" - 🍊 a trivial little 🍋 piece of junk 🍊 based on the manga 🍋 from the rather obscure 🍋 artist, Oki Hajime. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] think there was also a 🍋 movie based on this as well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In "SWAT" 🍋 (as far as I can tell) 🍊 you control a 🍋 four-man S.W.A.T. team. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your objective is to 🍊 infiltrate the 🍋 office building 🍊 and kill terrorists. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Presumably there's some 🍋 other plot points as well, 🍊 but when I was playing, 🍋 I [pretty] much just 🍊 encountered a lot of 🍋 firefights with terrorists. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You act these out 🍋 "Dragon Quest"-style, 🍊 [only] much longer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You select actions for 🍋 all your team members, 🍊 then everyone lines up 🍋 and takes shots. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya have weapons 🍋 such as knives, S.M.G.s, 🍊 hand grenades, rifles, 🍋 and 'WIR' 🍊 (which I guess is a wire 🍋 used to garrote someone; 🍊 that's [pretty] brutal). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike "Dragon Quest", 🍊 these battles are 🍋 way too long 🍊 and there's no sort of 🍋 animation 🍊 or anything of 🍋 visual interest 🍊 really occurring at all 🍊 - other than some 🍋 text being displayed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can simply wound your 🍋 enemies, in order to get 🍋 to talk to them afterwards. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or, um, 🍊 if you keep shooting 🍋 you can simply kill them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if this 🍋 somehow sounds cool 🍊 and interesting 🍋 and different, 🍊 well yeah, I... 🍋 I guess it would be 🍊 if the game 🍋 wasn't so terrible. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I just shot 🍋 someone right there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's [only] wounded so far, 🍊 but, uh, because I'd 🍋 actually then 🍊 taken a few more 🍋 shots at him, 🍊 I've actually 🍋 killed him entirely. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, one thing 🍋 about this is the, uh, 🍊 the encounter rate 🍋 is really absurd! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, I ran into, like 🍋 three groups of enemies 🍊 before taking even, 🍋 like, one step. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And look how screwed up 🍋 the backgrounds are 🍊 when you're walking around! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Many of the names in the 🍋 credits for "Hokuto No Ken" 🍊 turn up in "SWAT" as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it's really no surprise 🍋 this is terrible. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And I guess the idea 🍊 of a slightly tactical 🍋 squad-based "SWAT" game 🍊 is [pretty] unique to 🍋 the system so far, 🍊 but the execution just 🍋 simply kills the whole thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like other Bears games, 🍋 this gets, like, you know, 🍊 really low marks for 🍋 visual presentation. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, seriously, 🍋 would you actually 🍊 want to work in 🍋 [an] office building 🍊 with walls that color? 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Digital Devil Saga: Megami Tensei 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 11 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atlus
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If "Zoids..." and "SWAT" 🍊 demonstrated the wrong 🍋 way to do an R.P.G., 🍊 then let's take a look 🍊 at something a 🍋 bit more credible: 🍊 "Digital Devil Saga: 🍋 Megami Tensei". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, that's right; 🍊 this is the first 🍋 'Megami Tensei' game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The series is 🍋 actually that old. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There have been many 🍋 games in this series, 🍊 including the now very 🍋 popular 'Persona' games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But this makes 🍋 'Megami Tensei' 🍊 one of the 🍋 longest running 🍋 console R.P.G. series 🍊 (along 'Dragon Warrior'). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is based on a 🍋 novel by one Aya Nishitani. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It concerns a brilliant 🍋 high school student who 🍊 writes a computer program 🍋 that can summon demons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This unleashes 🍋 the god, Loki, 🍊 who causes all 🍋 sorts of trouble. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Ridiculous', you say? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, remember that 🍋 back in the 1980s 🍊 Home Computers were 🍋 still [pretty] new. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 People really 🍋 put a lot of faith 🍊 in the capabilities 🍋 of these things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After all, according to 🍋 contemporary pop culture, 🍊 it was conceivable 🍋 that you could use one 🍋 to start a nuclear war, 🍊 or maybe create an 🍋 artificial human being 🍋 out of nothing, 🍊 or maybe that computers 🍋 would require human blood 🍋 to perform various evil acts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So summoning demons 🍋 on a computer 🍊 wasn't really outside 🍋 the realm of possibility. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You start by choosing your 🍋 character's attributes 🍊 (you have, sort of, like, uh, 🍋 attribute points to assign) 🍊 and then go 🍋 into the dungeon 🍊 and put a stop to 🍋 the demons' evil plans. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The main bad guys here 🍊 seem to be Loki, 🍋 Lucifer, and Seth. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of the gods 🍋 and demons and spells 🍋 in this game 🍊 return in many of 🍋 the later games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "...Megami Tensei" is a 🍋 first-person Dungeon Crawler, 🍊 but one that gives you 🍋 a lot of freedom 🍊 for a Japanese R.P.G. 🍋 of this vintage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually rather 🍋 groundbreaking in some ways. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game was developed 🍋 by Atlas, it seems, 🍊 and is the first of two 🍋 Atlas games this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The man who apparently 🍋 created the series 🍊 is one Kouji Okada. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He worked on the 🍋 series for years 🍊 before leaving 🍋 Atlas in 2003. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are no enemies 🍋 on the first level, 🍊 so ya walk around, 🍋 talk to N.P.C.s, 🍊 find some money, 🍋 buy some items. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's what I'm doing 🍋 there, by the way. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then head out 🍋 to kick some ass! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So here's your basic Slime. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya have your 🍋 standard options 🍊 (Fight, and Run, 🍋 and, uh, so on) 🍊 and, uh... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Excuse me? 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 I'm getting killed? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first monster I 🍋 encounter killed me 🍊 in, like, two turns? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Yeah, this game does 🍋 seem to have a, uh, 🍊 (how shall we say?) 🍊 rather steep 🍋 difficulty curve. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The strategy, early on, 🍋 seems to be: 🍊 go up one floor, 🍋 fight a monster, 🍊 then run back to 🍋 the first level, 🍊 get healed up, 🍋 and then repeat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, ya 🍋 Level Up [pretty] fast 🍊 but this game really 🍋 throws no punches. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One nice thing is 🍋 you are able to 🍊 usually successfully 🍋 run away from enemies 🍊 (actually quite helpful 🍋 after you've been, uh...) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I guess I've 🍋 actually died again here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Really hate that 🍋 Minotaur guy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there's actually 🍋 one new option here: 🍊 uh... the Auto fight option. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hitting that will 🍋 put the game on, uh... 🍊 the game battle on autopilot, 🍋 which is [pretty] useful 🍊 when you're, sort of, 🍋 reasonably powered up 🍊 and you're just, sort of, 🍋 going through, uh, levels 🍊 and taking on 🍋 normal enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But the big, big novelty of 🍋 the 'Megami Tensei' games 🍊 is that you can get demons 🍋 to join you as allies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Rather than fighting, 🍋 you can talk to them, 🍊 and sometimes they might 🍋 join your party for a price. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can then 🍋 breed demons together 🍊 to create 🍋 more powerful demons 🍊 since they don't 🍋 Level Up like you do. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The entire series 🍋 is actually sort of 🍊 built around this 🍋 demon-breeding concept. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I've gotten myself 🍋 [pretty] banged up here; 🍊 we'll need to head back 🍋 to the main floor 🍊 to get the other 🍋 party member revived. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Incidentally, your other 🍋 party member is Yumiko 🍊 who just happens to be 🍊 a reincarnation of the 🍋 Shinto goddess, Izanami. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Megami Tensei' means 🍋 'Goddess Reincarnation'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly, in the latest game 🍋 in the series, "Persona 4" 🍊 (and, oh yeah, here is 🍋 a spoiler alert) 🍊 ...in "Persona 4", 🍋 the final bad guy 🍊 turns out to be Izanami. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So the series has, sort of, 🍋 come full circle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're at all familiar 🍋 with the story of Izanami, 🍊 you'll know 🍋 she's a goddess 🍊 with a... whole lot of 🍋 problems, to say the least. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One very cool thing 🍋 about this game is that, 🍊 while many Role-Playing 🍋 Games used your typical, 🍊 ya know, giant centipedes 🍋 and dragons and ogres 🍋 and whatnot, 🍊 many of the characters 🍋 are based off of 🍊 figures from 🍋 world mythology - 🍊 various demons and gods 🍋 and goddesses and whatnot. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And while this game has 🍋 fallen a bit into obscurity, 🍊 there is an even more 🍋 obscure 'Megami Tensei' game 🍊 that came out right 🍋 around the same time - 🍊 actually a little bit 🍋 before this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The FamiCom game was 🍋 published by Namco. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, uh, Nihon Telenet 🍋 of "Valis..." fame 🍊 released this game 🍋 for the M.S.X. and 🍋 PC-88 computers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Developed by Wolf Team, 🍊 it uses the 🍋 same basic concept, 🍊 but is a much 🍋 simpler top-down 🍋 Action R.P.G.-type game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is very similar to the 🍋 situation with "Valis...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I can [only] assume, uh, 🍋 Telenet wasn't interested 🍋 in releasing FamiCom games 🍊 so they were licensing the 🍋 rights to their properties 🍋 to other publishers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Whatever the story was, 🍊 it ended up being 🍋 the Namco game, 🍊 not this one, 🍋 that took off 🍊 and launched a thousand 🍋 sequels and spin-offs. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There doesn't 🍋 really seem to be 🍊 anything wrong with 🍋 the Telenet game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It just, sort of, 🍊 falls in the shadow of 🍋 the Atlas-developed game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So anyway, while 🍋 "...Megami Tensei" is 🍊 basically a Dungeon Crawler, 🍊 there are a lot of factors 🍋 that set it apart 🍋 from similar games 🍊 like the, uh, 🍋 'Deep Dungeon' series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from having 🍋 vastly superior graphics 🍋 and enemy design, 🍊 and [though] the pseudo 🍋 3D environments are 🍋 actually somewhat convincing, 🍊 there's also a bit more 🍋 variety in the dungeons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Most surprisingly, 🍋 some parts actually 🍋 take place outside. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You move down city streets, 🍊 with rows of buildings 🍋 replacing, uh, 🍋 the dungeon walls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is not something 🍋 I've actually seen 🍊 in first-person Dungeon 🍋 Crawlers, prior to this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are also 🍋 way more spells 🍊 than in your other Japanese 🍋 R.P.G.s of this time, 🍊 including sort of 🍋 elemental aligned 🍋 attack spells, 🍊 various status spells 🍊 (I get put to sleep 🍋 here as you can see), 🍊 a spell to 🍋 show you the map - 🍊 uh, even enemies have 🍋 good or evil alignments. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, most of 🍋 the 'Megami Tensei' games 🍊 were not released 🍋 outside of Japan 🍊 until relatively recently. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this game has never 🍋 been available in English. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 An English translation 🍋 is apparently forthcoming 🍊 (an unofficial 🍋 translation that is) 🍊 and once that happens, 🍊 I'd like to see the game 🍋 get a bit more attention 🍋 in the West. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As far as I can' tell,' 🍋 this game suffers from 🍊 a lot of the same problems 🍋 as other Japanese R.P.G.s: 🍊 lots of grinding required, 🍊 uh, really 🍋 not much in terms of 🍋 character development 🍊 or plot or 🍋 anything like that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But if you compare this 🍋 to other R.P.G.s released 🍋 in the FamiCom in 1987, 🍊 it really is 🍋 very impressive. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tsuppari Oozumou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 18 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tecmo 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Tecmo has a bit 🍋 of a reputation 🍊 for its Sports 🍋 titles in the U.S., 🍊 mostly due to 🍋 "Tecmo Bowl". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, here's one 🍋 you probably haven't seen: 🍋 "Tsuppari Oozumou". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oozumou is the 🍋 sport that we call 🍊 Professional Sumo Wrestling. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, in Japan, Sumo is 🍋 a very serious sport - 🍊 almost a sacred sport 🍋 in some ways. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It has connections 🍋 to Shinto, 🍊 and there are aspects 🍋 regarding the purity 🍋 of the sport 🍊 that might puzzle 🍋 the non-Japanese. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍊 females are not allowed 🍋 to enter a sumo ring, 🍊 and a handful of salt 🍋 is thrown into [a] ring 🍊 before the bout 🍋 in order to purify it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Supari' 🍋 means roughly 'thrust' 🍊 and is a basic Sumo 🍋 move, as seen on the 🍋 game box cover art. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Tsuppari Oozumou" is 🍋 sort of like a typical 🍋 Wrestling Game title, 🍊 in that you face a 🍋 series of opponents 🍊 in order to climb 🍋 the sumo ranks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, ya [only] have 🍋 two basic attacks; 🍊 you can shove your 🍋 opponent backwards 🍊 or grab him by the thong. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The other Sumo will 🍋 do the same to you 🍊 and you'll need to 🍋 counter his attacks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You generally win a round by 🍋 pushing him out of the ring 🍊 or by getting his 🍋 stamina down to zero, 🍊 which will often 🍋 trigger some sort of 🍋 instant win move. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each Sumo has 🍋 a Stamina Meter 🍊 down there at the bottom; 🍊 you can, kind of, 🍋 see the meter 🍊 sort of constantly 🍋 moving up and down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I don't really 🍋 fully understand 🍊 how this meter works. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 A successful attack 🍋 will decrease the 🍋 Stamina of the attackee 🍊 (that's the left 🍋 portion on the bar). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the bar also seems 🍋 to increase in length 🍊 and starts 🍋 flashing at times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, I don't 🍋 really fully understand 🍊 the mechanics of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is notable for 🍋 being the first console 🍋 Sumo Game 🍊 (actually one of the 🍋 first Sumo Games, period). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There was an Arcade 🍋 Game from Technos 🍊 a few years prior. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While Sumo Games would 🍋 never be as common 🍊 as say, Mahjong Games, 🍊 it is a significant 🍋 Japanese game genre, 🍊 distinct from the 🍋 traditional American 🍋 Wrestling Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Tsuppari Oozumou" did 🍋 end up getting a sequel 🍊 on the Super FamiCom, 🍋 a few years later. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Is it any good? 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 Well, I guess it's okay. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The move set, 🍋 like I mentioned, 🍋 seems very limited. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Basically, you can push - 🍊 sort of grab and 🍋 try to lift up, 🍊 and you can actually, 🍋 uh, swing him around. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is useful if 🍋 you're getting near 🍋 the edge o' the ring, 🍊 though, at times, 🍋 the game does feel sort of 🍋 like a button-mashing fest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game does have 🍋 a sense of humor; 🍊 some of the 🍋 finishing moves 🍊 are actually quite 🍋 humorous looking. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose fans of 🍋 Wrestling Games 🍊 might wanna 🍋 check this out, 🍊 just to, sort of, 🍋 see something 🍋 a little different. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 A Brief Look at Computer Games of 1987 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 As a little special 🍋 feature this episode, 🍊 I thought I'd take 🍋 a closer look at 🍊 some of the non-Nintendo 🍋 video games in the year 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've already been examining 🍋 the Sega Master System 🍊 in our sister 🍋 series, 'Chronsega'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But one major source of 🍋 video game entertainment 🍊 in 1987 was 🍋 the Home Computer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There isn't goin' 🍋 to be any sort of 🍋 'Croncomputer' series, 🍊 so I thought maybe 🍋 we'd take a quick look 🍊 at the world of 🍋 Computer Games in 1987. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Intro: The Rise of the Home Computer ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 By the early 1980s, 🍋 Home Computers were 🍊 becoming very affordable 🍋 and immensely popular. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The rise of the computer 🍋 figured quite heavily 🍊 into the Video Game Crash 🍋 of 1983 to 1984. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By 1987, the major players 🍋 were as follows 🍊 (the grand old men of the 🍋 Home Computer scene): 🍊 the Apple II (originally 🍋 introduced in 1977) 🍊 and the Commodore 64 🍋 (from 1982). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The newcomers on the scene 🍋 were the rather expensive 🍋 M... Apple Macintosh 🍊 (released to great 🍋 fanfare in 1984), 🍊 the Atari S.T., 🍋 and the Commodore Amiga 🍊 (both of which featured 🍋 what might be called 🍋 next-gen graphics). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These were both 🍋 released in 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The I.B.M. P.C. 🍋 (or P.C. clone) 🍊 saw a new graphical 🍋 standard, E.G.A., in 1984 and 🍊 introduced the cutting edge 🍋 V.G.A. standard in 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And overseas there were 🍋 the machines that were 🍋 popular regionaly 🍊 such as the Spectrums, 🍋 M.S.X.s, PC-88s and ...98s, 🍊 Sharps, and so on. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Genre: Text Adventure Games ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's start off with one of 🍋 the oldest Computer Game 🍋 genres: the Adventure Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enormously popular 🍋 in the early 1980s, 🍊 Text Adventure Games 🍋 were still a viable 🍋 niche genre in 1987. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Lurking Horror ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Infocomm, the company 🍋 behind the blockbuster, 🍊 "Zork", was still 🍋 putting these things out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 "The Lurking Horror", 🍊 a Lovecraft-themed 🍋 Text Adventure Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 These games were, ya know, 🍋 all text [and] no graphics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All input had to 🍋 be typed in 🍊 in a fashion so that 🍋 the text parser 🍊 could actually understand 🍋 what you were trying to say. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Gameplay tended to 🍋 revolve around exploration, 🍊 item collecting, 🍋 and puzzle solving. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Beyond Zork: The Coconut of Quendor ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Beyond Zork" 🍋 was a fairly late entry 🍊 in Infocom's 🍋 flagship series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some basic graphic elements 🍋 were added into the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But either way, the 🍋 Text Adventure (or 🍊 Interactive Fiction genre, 🍋 as it was eventually called) 🍊 was already [pretty] 🍋 retro by 1987. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Genre: Graphical Adventure Games ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 A more modern variation 🍋 on the series was the 🍋 Graphical Adventure Game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Leisure Suit Larry in The Land of the Lounge Lizards ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 1987 sees the debut of 🍋 the 'Leisure Suit Larry' 🍋 franchise from Sierra. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sierra [pretty] much 🍋 invented the genre in 1984 🍊 with its game 🍋 "King's Quest". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At this time, Sierra 🍋 was the big name in 🍋 Computer Adventure Games, 🍊 and "...Larry" was 🍋 an attempt to produce 🍊 an adult-orientated 🍋 Adventure Game with, 🍋 like, a humorous edge. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While this was very tame 🍋 by today's standards, 🍊 it was reasonably 🍋 edgy in 1987. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Sierra's games allowed you 🍊 to move your character 🍋 around with a joystick, 🍊 though you still 🍋 had to input 🍊 commands or speech 🍋 via the keyboard. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nowadays, of course, these 🍋 games seem a little unfair 🍊 - full of, ya know, 🍋 unexpected deaths 🍋 and illogical puzzles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That was kind of the 🍋 in-house Sierra style. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, hmm... 🍋 flush the toilet? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, ya better 🍋 not do that! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But overall, the 🍋 '...Larry' games - 🍊 they were [pretty] fun 🍋 and, uh, [pretty] reasonable 🍊 for Adventure Games 🍋 of this era. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Police Quest ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Police Quest' 🍋 was another Sierra series 🍋 that debuted in 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this was a 🍋 relatively accurate 🍊 police procedural game, 🍊 in which you must... 🍋 well, you sorta 🍊 do a lot of boring 🍋 police stuff, actually. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Again, uh, there are tons 🍋 of ways to get Game Overs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Forget to inspect your 🍋 vehicle before drop it... 🍋 driving off? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, then, 🍋 it's a Game Over! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Late for your briefing? 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 Game Over. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Most Sierra games had, 🍋 sort of, some kind of 🍊 frustrating Action 🍋 Adventure sequences 🍊 and "Police Quest" 🍋 was no exception. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, for example, 🍊 when you have to drive 🍋 your car around. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 If you hit anything at all, 🍋 well, then it's Game Over. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, these games 🍋 allowed you [to] save 🍋 anytime you wanted to. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Déjà Vu ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, even though the 🍋 Graphical Adventure genre 🍋 is [only] three years old, 🍊 a new generation of games 🍋 was already emerging. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, ICOM 🍋 Simulations' 'MacVenture' 🍋 games for the Macintosh. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This series began in 1985 🍋 with "Déjà Vu", 🍊 which was a detective game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Instead of 🍋 typing in your text, 🍊 you interact using a 🍋 point and click interface 🍋 with the mouse 🍊 and a number of menu options 🍊 (actually very similar to 🍋 the Japanese Adventure Games 🍊 we were seeing 🍋 on the FamiCom). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Shadowgate ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 1987 saw the most 🍋 well-known 'MacVenture' 🍋 game "Shadowgate", 🍊 which also had 🍋 an Amiga release 🍊 with a substantial 🍋 graphics update. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is what we're 🍋 looking at here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While the interface 🍋 was streamlined, 🍊 "Shadowgate" still had the 🍋 same issues as Sierra's games 🍊 (namely, constant death). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can die 🍋 in the first room 🍊 if you don't light the 🍋 second torch quick enough. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, you stumble 🍋 around in the dark 🍊 and break your neck 🍋 (not very heroic). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Lots of picking up items 🍊 and figuring out 🍋 how to use them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game was 🍋 [pretty] successful 🍊 and there was 🍋 an N.E.S. port, 🍊 um, that's still 🍋 remembered today 🍊 (though, of course, 🍋 they might not be 🍋 happy memories). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, here - 🍋 you can clearly see 🍋 there's a ladder leading down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why did you fall and die? 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Maniac Mansion ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the way forward 🍋 in Adventure Games 🍊 came in the form of 🍋 "Maniac Mansion" 🍋 from LucasArts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was the first game w... 🍋 from their new SCUMM engine, 🍊 and features a, uh, 🍋 very easy-to-use interface. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 With "Maniac Mansion", 🍋 LucasArts s... kind of 🍊 sent Adventure Games 🍋 in [a] new direction 🍊 (one that didn't 🍋 involve constant deaths 🍊 and game-ending 🍋 dead ends). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Many folks consider 🍋 the games that followed 🍋 "Maniac Mansion" from LucasArts 🍊 to be, sort of, the pinnacle 🍋 of the Adventure genre. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As for "Maniac Mansion", 🍊 it received 🍋 a well-known Nintendo port 🍊 a few years later, 🍋 and was definitely 🍊 one of the major 🍋 highlights of 1987. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Genre: War Games ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Panzer Strike ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another really ancient 🍋 Computer Game genre 🍋 was that of the War Game, 🍊 as seen here with 🍋 "Panzer Strike" 🍋 (a DOS game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like R.P.G.s, 🍋 War Games were 🍋 based on board games 🍊 and had a rather 🍋 cultish following. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 SSI was one o' the 🍋 publishers of War Games 🍋 back in the day, 🍊 and in 1987, they were 🍋 still cranking them out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 These games are all about 🍋 strategies, stats, and 🍋 historical accuracy 🍊 rather than stylish 🍋 graphics (obviously). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You generally take one side 🍋 in [a] historic battle 🍊 and move your units around 🍋 on these giant maps 🍊 trying to overcome 🍋 the other army. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Genre: Military Simulation ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Related to War Games 🍊 were the 🍋 Military Simulation Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Flight Simulations were 🍋 actually [pretty] popular, 🍋 I guess 🍊 (well, they're still 🍋 around today, of course). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Project Stealth Fighter ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 One quality title was 🍋 Microprose's 🍊 "Project Stealth Fighter" 🍋 for the Commodore 64. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These are not casual games; 🍊 they were aimed at military 🍋 aircraft aficionados. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Project Stealth Fighter" 🍋 gives you a wide variety 🍊 of options for planes 🍋 and weapons and missions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, these games 🍋 use a very complicated 🍋 control scheme; 🍊 you really have to know 🍋 how to actually operate 🍋 the jets' equipment, 🍊 so you can't simply 🍋 pick up and play. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Genre: Strategy Games ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, many gameplay 🍋 ideas from War Games 🍊 would wind up in what we 🍋 now call the Strategy Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These tend to involve 🍋 other elements beyond 🍋 battlefield encounters, 🍊 such as managing resources, 🍋 technology, exploration, etc. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The genre wasn't really 🍋 fully formed in 1987. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Anacreon: Reconstruction 4021 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 But an early example 🍋 was this: "Anacreon: 🍋 Reconstruction 4021", 🍊 from the obscure 🍋 Thinking Machine [Associates]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There was 🍋 exploration of space, 🍋 building armies, 🍊 communicating with 🍋 other empires, 🍊 researching new technologies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And these are all done 🍊 through a rather 🍋 clunky text interface. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to type in the 🍋 coordinates of planets to 🍋 identify them, for example 🍊 (no pointing and 🍋 clicking, here). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, later games 🍋 like "Civilization", 🍋 "Dune II", and so on 🍊 would popularize 🍋 g... -- the genre. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, 🍋 these games were usually 🍋 a little bit easier to play. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Pirates! ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, another huge hit 🍋 of 1987 was "Pirates" 🍊 for the Commodore 64. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This Sid Meier game 🍊 was different than 🍋 anything else at the time; 🍊 it was almost 🍋 completely open-ended - 🍊 an early sandbox game, 🍋 I suppose. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There was a lot of 🍋 sailing around, 🍊 looking for gold, and 🍋 swordfighting involved. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But it was really up to 🍋 the player how the game 🍋 was [to] be played. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Pirates" could be played 🍋 over and over again 🍊 and never be the same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was ported 🍋 to [pretty] much 🍊 every system 🍋 under the sun 🍊 (often under the name 🍋 "Sid Meier's Pirates") 🍊 and eventually including 🍊 the Nintendo 🍋 Entertainment System. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Tai-Pan ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, more typical 🍋 was "Taipan" from 🍋 Ocean Software, 🍊 seen here in its 🍋 rather ugly form 🍋 for the Commodore 64, 🍊 based on the 🍋 James Clavell novel. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was actually 🍋 the second game 🍋 based on the novel. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Presumably, this was 🍋 released to cash in 🍊 on the "Taipan" movie 🍋 that came out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess this was 🍋 sort of an Adventure-y, 🍊 uh, drug-smuggling 🍋 Simulation-type Game 🍊 (not very 🍋 playable or enjoyable 🍋 by today's standards). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Defender of the Crown ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one Strategy Game that 🍋 was immensely successful 🍊 was "Defender of the Crown". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game actually 🍋 came out in 1986 🍊 but its impact was 🍋 still being felt 🍋 the next year in '87. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While much simpler 🍋 than "Anacreon...", 🍊 it was one of 🍋 the first games 🍊 to demonstrate the awesome 🍋 graphical capabilities 🍊 of the Commodore Amiga. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No one had really seen 🍋 anything quite like this 🍋 on Home Computers before. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 1987 saw developers 🍋 exploring what could 🍊 be done with the Amiga, 🍋 as we'll see shortly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The object here 🍋 is basically to 🍋 take over the empire 🍊 (quite similar to 🍋 "Nobunaga's Revenge" 🍊 which came out 🍋 for the FamiCom 🍋 a little bit later. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Genre: Puzzle Elements ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Colony ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, let's take a look 🍋 at this odd little game, 🍋 "Colony". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As a rule, Computer Games 🍋 tended to focus more on 🍋 puzzle-solving and strategy 🍋 than console games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even Action Games 🍋 tended to require you 🍋 to do a bit more than 🍊 move forward and 🍋 jump over things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, for example, ya need 🍋 to protect your outposts 🍋 from hordes of insects. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This involves repairing 🍋 fences, growing mushrooms, 🍊 stocking up on supplies, 🍋 and so on 🍊 (sort of a colony 🍋 management Sim). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was published by 🍋 the British computer giant, 🍋 [Mastertronic]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were responsible for 🍋 marketing and distributing 🍊 the Sega Master System 🍋 in Europe. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, some staff 🍋 members, uh, from 🍊 [Mastertronic] formed the 🍋 core of Virgin Interactive. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Not a bad little game 🍋 and one that's sort of 🍋 forgotten nowadays, 🍊 but was quite popular 🍋 at the time. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Tower Toppler ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another excellent 🍋 Commodore 64 🍊 Puzzle-type game 🍋 was "Tower Toppler" 🍊 from another British 🍋 company, Hewson. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game takes you on this, 🍋 uh, cylindrical tower, 🍊 and there's actually... 🍋 a very clever feature is 🍊 that the tower turns 🍋 as your character moves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [pretty] impressive 🍋 for a game on the older 🍋 Commodore 64 system. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 To this day, 🍋 clones of "Tower Toppler" 🍋 continue to be released. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Kingdom of Kroz ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, far less attractive 🍊 is the DOS game, 🍋 "Kingdom of Kroz". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the first in a 🍋 series of maze-based 🍊 Puzzle Games in 🍋 the 'Kroz' series. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The notable thing about 🍋 "...Kroz" is that the... 🍊 this was actually the first 🍋 game from Apogee Software. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A few years down the road, 🍊 they would publish 🍋 "Wolfenstein 3D" 🍋 and "Duke Nukem", 🍊 thus, uh, sort of 🍋 kicking off the 🍋 First-Person Shooter genre. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And they would change 🍋 their name, of course, 🍋 to 3D Realms. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Xor ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Tons of these sorts of 🍋 games existed at the time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍋 "Xor", for example. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose this is 🍋 sort of the equivalent 🍊 to FamiCom games like 🍋 HAL Laboratory's "Eggerland". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸the Fool's Errand ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 One very odd little 🍋 Puzzle Game was 🍋 "...Fool's Errand", 🍊 a Macintosh game 🍋 from Cliff Johnson. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This quirky 🍋 independent game, um, 🍊 and its follow-up 🍋 "3 In Three", 🍊 received critical accolades 🍊 and developed quite a cult 🍋 following over the years. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game involves 🍋 solving a series of 🍋 interconnected puzzles, 🍊 which unlock chapters in, 🍋 uh, the game's storybook. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's, uh, sometimes 🍋 kind of a baffling game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This just shows the 🍋 potential for creative 🍊 and unique games 🍋 on Home Computers. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Genre: Action Games | 'Arcade-Style' Games ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 And of course, 🍊 there were also your more 🍋 standard Action Games 🍊 on Computers, as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from the 🍋 many Arcade ports, 🍊 uh, there were innumerable 🍋 so-called Arcade-Style Games 🍋 that were produced. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Last Ninja ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Among the more notable: 🍊 "The Last Ninja" 🍋 for the Commodore 64. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 From the British 🍋 studio, System 3, 🍊 this game remains an 🍋 old-school favorite 🍊 and was ported to every 🍋 Computer system under the 🍋 sun, and had a few sequels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As with many 🍋 Computer Action Games, 🍊 it suffers from rather 🍋 stiff and unpleasant controls, 🍊 so don't exactly expect 🍋 "Ninja Gaiden" here, if you 🍋 try to play it nowadays. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Thexder ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 We've already seen 🍋 this one: "Thexder". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... This is a DOS version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Originally for the 🍋 Japanese computers, 🍊 it was ported to 🍋 the FamiCom by Square 🍊 and then brought to 🍋 the U.S. by Sierra 🍊 (turned out to be a big hit - 🍋 one of Sierra's biggest hits) 🍊 and set a new standard for 🍋 cool-looking Action Games 🍋 on Computers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Thexder" was probably 🍋 around the closest thing 🍊 to a console game to be 🍋 available on computers, 🍋 at this time. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Demon Stalkers: The Raid of Doomfane ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, ripping off Arcade 🍋 Games was also quite common. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Take "Demon Stalkers", 🍋 for example. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a game for 🍋 the Commodore 64 🍊 very much in the 🍋 style of "Gauntlet". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Developed by the Australian 🍋 company Micro Forte and... 🍊 (or maybe that's 🍋 Micro Forté) 🍊 ...and published by 🍋 Electronic Arts. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Airborne Ranger ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Airborne Rangers" 🍋 from Sid Meier's 🍋 company, Microprose, 🍊 takes the gameplay style 🍋 of "Commando" and adds... 🍊 well, uh, lots of stuff! 🍊 (all kinds of weapons, 🍋 different missions...). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Microprose was a huge 🍋 publisher in the 🍋 late '80s and mid-'90s, 🍊 with such hits as 🍋 "Pirates", "Civilization", 🍊 "Railroad Tycoon", 🍋 "Master of Orion", 🍋 and so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, it was 🍋 eventually swallowed up 🍊 by the video game 🍋 giant, Infogrames. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Barbarian ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one game that 🍋 wowed gamers with its 🍋 very stylish graphics 🍊 was "Barbarian" for the 🍋 Atari S.T. and the Amiga. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The publisher was Psygnosis 🍊 (or is that PsyGnosis? 🍋 - not really sure.) 🍊 a British publisher, 🍋 noted for its, uh, 🍋 nice graphics and artwork. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Several games feature 🍋 the art of Roger Dean, 🍊 including this one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya might remember he was 🍋 the guy who did, like, 🍊 those 'Yes', record albums 🍋 back in the '70s. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While, "Barbarian" 🍋 looks great, 🍊 it should be pointed out 🍋 that your character 🍋 moves absurdly slowly 🍊 and the game has a rather 🍋 unwieldy control scheme. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya have to, like, 🍋 hit all the buttons 🍋 there along the bottom 🍊 in order to actually 🍋 get the guy to do things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One nice thing about the 🍋 Nintendo and the FamiCom 🍊 was that the rather 🍋 simple controller 🍊 meant that developers 🍋 kind of had to 🍊 keep the controls 🍋 simple and usable. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Genre: Sports Games ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸California Games ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, of course, 🍋 Sports Games were 🍋 another big genre, 🍊 and one very successful 🍋 Sports publisher was EPYX. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 We've already 🍋 seen them, uh, 🍊 "Winter Games", that really 🍋 horrible port of which 🍊 we saw on the FamiCom 🍋 a few episodes ago. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's their latest, 🍋 "California Games". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The EPYX Sports series 🍋 all feature a number of 🍊 different 🍋 competitive events. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The primary challenge is 🍋 actually trying to master 🍊 the sometimes rather baroque 🍋 and absurd control schemes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 EPYX was huge at the time, 🍊 but their fortunes very 🍋 quickly turn... 🍊 took a turn 🍋 for the worse 🍊 and they disappeared 🍋 from the scene. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Skate or Die! ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Kind of similar was, 🍋 uh, "Skate or Die", 🍊 the first 🍋 internally-developed 🍋 Electronic Arts game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 E.A. was highly-regarded 🍋 in the mid-1980s 🍊 for their innovative games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, they 🍋 focused more on 🍊 mainstream style 🍋 console games 🍊 and today, of course, 🍋 they're an industry giant. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Skate or Die", in which... 🍋 has you, uh, competing 🍊 in a series of, uh, 🍋 various skating events, 🍊 was very successful and 🍋 did receive a FamiCom port 🍊 a little bit 🍋 down the road. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Earl Weaver Baseball ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Baseball Games were 🍋 always popular on both 🍋 consoles and computers. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Earl Weaver's Baseball" 🍋 (from Electronic Arts, again) 🍊 for the Amiga 🍋 was an example of 🍊 the high level of 🍋 realism found in some 🍋 Computer Sports Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You had tons of options 🍋 and choices to make. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the game had a [pretty] 🍋 serious baseball pedigree 🍊 (unlike something like, 🍋 you know, "Bases Loaded" 🍋 for the FamiCom). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not [only] were 🍋 the programmers 🍊 veterans of Baseball Games, 🍊 going back to the 🍋 Intellivision days, 🍊 but the legendary Orioles 🍋 manager, Earl Weaver, 🍊 was actually 🍋 involved in the game 🍊 to a substantial degree 🍊 (unlike a lot of, 🍋 you know, Sports Games 🍊 where they have some, 🍋 uh, major player's, 🍋 uh, name in the title). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Test Drive ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Test Drive" was the first 🍋 in a series of popular 🍋 Driving Games from Accolade. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That, of course, was 🍋 an Atari or Activision 🍋 spin-off company. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like 🍋 "Earl Weaver's Baseball", 🍊 the emphasis is on realism; 🍊 the cars you drive are all 🍋 actual exotic sports cars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there is 🍋 much more detail, uh, 🍊 given to the cars 🍊 (such as, like, the 🍋 various gauges and controls 🍋 and so on and so forth) 🍊 than in a game 🍋 like "Rad Racer". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Computer Driving Games 🍋 often cross the line from, 🍊 like, Racing Games to, sort 🍋 of, Driving Simulation Games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Tech: Early 3D Games ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, while 🍋 video games in 1987 🍊 were still primarily 2D 🍋 (or, you know, simulated 3D) 🍊 a few games were 🍋 pushing the envelope 🍊 towards genuine 3D graphics. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Driller ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Driller" from Incentive 🍋 Software used Freescape, 🍊 which is actually d... 🍋 considered to be the first 🍊 full polygon-based 🍋 3D game engine. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the 🍋 Commodore 64 version, 🍊 though better looking 🍋 versions came out 🍊 a little bit later 🍋 for DOS, the Atari S.T., 🍋 and the Amiga 🍊 (often under the name 🍋 "Space [Station] Oblivion"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 While it's really not 🍋 much to look at today, 🍊 this was thrilling and 🍋 [pretty] amazing back in 1987. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Virus ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another early 🍋 British-developed 🍋 3D game was "Virus", 🍊 seen here in, 🍋 its DOS version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Originally a game created 🍋 for the cutting-edge 🍊 (and rather unsuccessful) 🍋 Acorn Archimedes computer, 🍊 "Virus" was a 🍋 simple Shooter, 🍊 but was rather pioneering 🍊 in its use of shading 🍋 and particle effects. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nowadays, it's not 🍋 very fun to play, 🍊 but it does hint at the 🍋 direction Computer Games 🍊 would be going 🍋 in the near future. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Genre: Role-Playing Games ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Wizardry IV: The Return of Werdna ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Coming full circle 🍋 to one of the very oldest 🍋 Computer Game genres, 🍊 we have "Wizardry IV: 🍋 ...Return of Werdna" 🍊 (originally for 🍋 the Apple II). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Wizardry' was 🍋 (along with 'Ultima') 🍊 the longest-running 🍋 established R.P.G. franchise, 🍊 so a new 'Wizardry' game 🍋 was a [pretty] big deal. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the series 🍋 was really showing its age 🍋 in 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It tried to make up for 🍋 the old-fashioned graphics 🍋 with the unique plot idea. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You play as the bad guy 🍊 (the wizard defeated 🍋 in the first game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You summon monsters 🍋 to help you fight. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the game 🍋 throws some things at you 🍊 that would really no longer 🍋 be considered acceptable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍊 in the very beginning, you 🍋 are trapped in a chamber 🍊 and the [only] way to [escape] 🍊 is to summon a 🍋 particular minion, 🍊 walk around in a circle 🍋 until you encounter 🍋 a random battle, 🍊 and hope that that minion 🍋 casts a particular spell 🍋 that opens hidden doors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You actually have no direct 🍋 control over the minions, 🍊 so you just have 🍋 to deal with this 🍊 until he actually just 🍋 happens to cast that spell. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game dispenses with 🍋 many of the R.P.G., 🍋 sort of, standard elements 🍊 like Experience Points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, while it is 🍋 innovative in some ways, 🍊 it's actually very 🍋 dated in others. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸2400 A.D. ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Origin Systems 🍋 put out other games 🍊 besides just the, uh, 🍋 'Ultima' releases 🍊 and "2400 A.D." 🍋 is one such game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Again, we have this 🍋 on the Apple II. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While most R.P.G.s 🍋 had Fantasy settings, 🍊 a few had 🍋 Science Fiction settings. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, we need 🍋 to free mankind 🍊 from its oppressive 🍋 robot overlords. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Much like 'Ultima', ya 🍋 walk around an overworld 🍊 and ya do a lot of 🍋 interaction with N.P.C.s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's basically 🍋 an Action R.P.G. 🍊 and, in a lot of ways, 🍋 is kinda closer to 🍊 the Japanese R.P.G.s, uh, 🍋 than games like 'Wizardry'. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Phantasie III: The Wrath of Nikademus ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, SSI, they made R.P.G.s 🍋 as well as War Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The third title in 🍋 their 'Phantasie' series 🍊 was released on various 🍋 platforms in 1987 🍊 (this is the very 🍋 good-looking Amiga version) 🍊 a standard Western R.P.G. 🍋 from what would [be] 🍊 considered to be, sort of, 🍋 like the golden age of 🍋 Computer R.P.G.s 🍊 (the late '80s 🍋 through early '90s). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While certainly 🍋 not a bad game, 🍊 "Phantasie III" would 🍋 be sort of overshadowed 🍊 by SSI's 'Gold Box' 🍋 series, starting with 🍊 the wildly successful 🍋 "Pool of Radiance", 🍊 which came out in 1988. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Dungeon Master ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 And finally, the big R.P.G. 🍋 at the end of 1987 🍊 was definitely 🍋 "Dungeon Master" 🍋 from FTL games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like many other 🍋 R.P.G.s of the era, 🍋 this is a Dungeon Crawler. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But "Dungeon Master" 🍋 introduces real-time battles 🍊 into the first-person 🍋 R.P.G. genre, 🍊 and also uses a 🍋 point and click system, 🍊 as opposed to 🍋 keyboard entries. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can move items 🍋 around in your inventory 🍊 and even equip them by 🍋 dragging and dropping. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Real-time combat and 🍋 mouse-based controls 🍊 would eventually bec... 🍋 go on to become, like, the 🍋 standard in Western R.P.G.s 🍊 (though "Dungeon Master" 🍋 was [pretty] much the game 🍋 that did it first). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Definitely still 🍋 a quality title 🍊 and one that I suppose 🍋 is recommended 🍊 if you're gonna be 🍋 playing any of the R.P.G.s 🍋 featured in this episode. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Conclusion: Computer Games of 1987 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, that wraps 🍋 up our look at 🍊 Computer Games of 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, this is 🍋 [only] a tiny fraction 🍊 of the many, many, many 🍊 games released for 🍋 computers this year, 🍊 but I think we've seen 🍋 many of the highlights 🍊 or representative titles 🍊 or games of 🍋 historical importance. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd consider the 🍋 big four games of '87 🍊 to be "Pirates", 🍋 "Maniac Mansion", 🍋 "Dungeon Master", 🍊 and (I suppose) 🍋 "Leisure Suit Larry...". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Conclusion: Back to the FamiCom ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, at any rate, 🍋 let's go ahead 🍊 and turn back 🍋 to the FamiCom. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Spelunker II 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 18 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Now Production
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's one big 🍋 surprise this episode: 🍊 "Spelunker II: 🍋 Yūsha e no Chōsen" - 🍊 a rather generic 🍋 sounding subtitle 🍊 that means something like 🍋 'Challenge of the Hero'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I say 'surprising' 🍊 because I would 🍋 have assumed 🍊 this resembled IREM's 🍋 sequel to "Lode Runner" 🍊 (another Brøderbund-🍋connected game) 🍊 ...you know, being that... 🍊 just a series of variations 🍋 on the original game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 First of all, 🍋 do you remember the 🍋 original "Spelunker"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was a classic 🍋 U.S. Computer Game, 🍋 designed by Tim Martin 🍊 (originally released 🍋 in 1983). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The little explorer 🍋 roams around the cave, 🍊 looking for treasure. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was infamously 🍋 ported to the FamiCom, 🍊 courtesy of IREM, in 1985, 🍋 and that version is actually, 🍋 uh, not very well-loved. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, "Spelunker II" 🍋 is completely different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, you would 🍋 never connect it to 🍋 the original game 🍊 if you didn't 🍋 know the title. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Right from the get-go, 🍊 you start with a 🍋 character-selection screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, "Spelunker II" 🍋 has character classes - 🍊 each with different 🍋 stats and abilities. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm going for the standard 🍋 Explorer class, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At this point in 🍋 the FamiCom's life, 🍊 even the most basic 🍋 Platforming Games 🍊 like "Spelunker" were 🍋 getting an R.P.G. makeover. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even though we haven't 🍋 seen too many genuine 🍋 R.P.G.s on the FamiCom, 🍊 every single game 🍋 seems to be sprinkling in 🍋 R.P.G. elements. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So you're armed with your 🍋 basic Explorer's Sword 🍊 (good for up-close attacks) 🍊 but you also have a 🍋 limited-ammo pistol. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] pistol comes in handy 🍊 in... for enemies you don't 🍋 want to get too close to 🍊 (like that gigantic venus 🍋 flytrap or whatever). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The world layout kinda 🍋 reminds me a little bit 🍊 of last episode's 🍋 "Valis...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya have these 🍋 horizontal paths 🍊 intersected by, 🍋 uh, vertical exits 🍊 that'll move you 🍋 north or south 🍊 onto another parallel path. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I can [only] assume this 🍋 particular world layout 🍊 was inspired by Konami's 🍋 "Ganbare Goemon!..." game, 🍊 which was the 🍋 first FamiCom game 🍊 to use something like it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 It also has the 🍋 three-quarters viewpoint 🍋 of "...Goemon...". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, other than 🍋 your Life Bar, 🍊 you have that bar 🍋 called 'Toku'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What does it do? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Toku' is usually 🍋 translated as 'virtue'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, watch what happens when 🍋 I, uh, shoot the deer, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You might wonder, 🍊 'How virtuous 🍋 is visiting some 🍋 pre-industrialized country, 🍊 stealing a treasure 🍋 you find, 🍊 and killing 🍋 all the local wildlife?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, according this game, 🍋 [pretty] virtuous. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, because I've 🍋 actually lost my virtue, 🍊 when I fall down 🍋 one of those pits, 🍊 I actually go 🍋 straight down into Hell. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If your Toku is too low, 🍋 then it's Game Over 🍊 (I guess you're 🍋 condemned eternally). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, higher Toku 🍋 will allow you to escape. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, by the way, I have 🍋 the Esper character. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, I was 🍋 able to be resurrected 🍊 and end up 🍋 back on the surface. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, certain animals are bad; 🍊 killing those will 🍋 raise your Toku. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Other animals 🍋 (like the deer) are good; 🍊 killing them will lower it 🍊 (but killing the deer 🍊 does actually 🍋 replenish your health). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, so far, 🍊 this looks more like 🍋 "Pitfall" than "Spelunker". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍋 But yes, 🍊 there is some actual 🍋 exploring caves in the game, 🍊 like we see here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You will encounter 🍋 various stairways 🍊 leading down into 🍋 the underground caverns, 🍊 generally with 🍋 tougher enemies 🍊 like, uh, ghosts and 🍋 zombies, for example. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These caves are 🍋 where you find 🍊 keys, treasures, items, etc. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, um, 🍋 they can be tough 🍊 because the 🍋 supernatural enemies 🍊 cannot be killed 🍋 by gun or knife 🍊 (which doesn't really 🍋 make much sense). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, ghosts - 🍋 yeah, I can understand - 🍊 but zombies!? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course you can 🍋 kill zombies with guns; 🍊 everyone knows that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Imagine trying to 🍋 play "Resident Evil" 🍊 if all the zombies were 🍋 somehow bulletproof. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You will eventually 🍋 find a crucifix 🍊 that will allow you to 🍋 dispatch the undead, 🍊 but you need to 🍋 have your, uh, 🍊 high enough Toku 🍋 to actually use it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I did find the crucifix, 🍋 but my Toku is too low; 🍊 I need to kill more 🍋 bad enemies to raise it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I mentioned, um, 🍊 this game actually 🍋 had character classes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Other than the Explorer, 🍊 the other ones are 🍋 a Wizard and an Esper. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, honestly, what 🍋 the Wizard would do, 🍊 romping around in 🍋 the Amazonian jungles, 🍊 is anyone's guess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Wizard 🍋 [and] Esper 🍊 use magical and 🍋 psychic powers, respectively. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, the Esper 🍋 shoots a lightning bolt 🍊 rather than a gun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, I'll take the Esper 🍋 out for a test drive. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I wonder if this was 🍋 originally even intended 🍋 as a 'Spelunker' game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The developer 🍋 seems to be a company 🍋 called Now Production 🍊 (the same guys who ported 🍋 "Metro Cross" for Namco). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It suffers from 🍊 small unattractive 🍋 character sprites 🍊 and, uh, somewhat 🍋 less than ideal controls, 🍊 but I guess it comes across 🍊 as a reasonably playable 🍋 Action-Adventure Game 🍊 with a certain amount 🍊 of exploration 🍋 and item collecting. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It's] certainly a huge 🍋 improvement over the, uh, 🍋 port of "Spelunker", 🍊 but this is really 🍋 a sequel in name [only]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Bio Senshi Dan: Increaser Tono Tatakai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 22 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atlus
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As promised, 🍋 here's the second 🍋 Atlas-developed game, 🍊 this time 🍋 published by Jaleco: 🍊 the somewhat absurdly-named 🍋 "Bio Senshi Dan: 🍋 Increaser Tono Tatakai". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (That means something 🍋 along the lines of 🍊 'Bio Warrior Dan: 🍋 Increaser Tono Battle'.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The "Terminator"-like 🍋 plot, detailed here, 🍊 explains the Earth has 🍋 been invaded by aliens 🍊 in the year 2081. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So our hero, Dan, is 🍋 traveling back in time 🍊 to stop the aliens before 🍋 they hatch their plans. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thankfully, 🍋 unlike in "Terminator", 🍊 his clothes travel with him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is (like 🍋 every other FamiCom game 🍋 released about this time) 🍊 an Action Game with 🍋 some R.P.G. elements. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was never released 🍋 outside of Japan, 🍊 however, it was 🍋 localized and prepared 🍊 for release in the U.S. 🍋 and then cancelled. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This version did 🍋 leak out a few years ago 🍊 and we'll be taking 🍋 a look at it here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Notice the plot is 🍋 completely dropped, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Jaleco renamed it "Bashi 🍋 Bazook: Morphoid Masher" 🍊 (whatever that is 🍋 supposed to mean). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Pretty] cool music, though. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, right away, this game 🍋 more or less stands out 🍊 for its excellent 🍋 presentation. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The developer, Atlas, 🍋 did a great job with 🍋 the graphics on the game 🍊 and mucus... music 🍋 is also very good. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 What is not so commendable 🍋 is the actual gameplay. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Right away, 🍋 you run into trouble 🍊 with some rather 🍋 hard-to-hit enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Still, there is 🍋 really fantastic work 🍋 on the N.P.C.s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you compared 🍋 the N.P.C. designs 🍊 from games like 🍋 "Chesterfield...", 🍊 you'll see 🍋 just how distinctive 🍋 each and every character is 🍊 (and they're all 🍋 fully animated as well). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Take a look at this guy, 🍋 comparing him to, like, say, 🍊 the, uh, helpful old 🍋 men in "...Zelda". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the same is also 🍋 true of the, uh, 🍊 the visual aspect 🍋 of the levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While the level design 🍊 is not going to knock 🍋 anyone off their feet 🍊 (it's just the, 🍋 uh, same old, uh, 🍊 platforms and elevators 🍋 that you see in so many 🍋 space-themed games) 🍊 they do look nice, 🍋 with lots of cool 🍋 colors and textures. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And a, uh, a few 🍋 minigames appear here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, you need to 🍋 wrestle this female alien 🍊 to win some cash. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You meet her a few times 🍋 throughout the game 🍊 and she does get 🍋 progressively tougher. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Money actually does play 🍋 a [pretty] important role 🍋 in this game, 🍊 so it is recommended that 🍋 you fight her if ya can. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is just a simple 🍋 button-mashing session. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But still, 🍋 I don't think I've seen 🍋 anything quite like it 🍊 in any o' the other 🍋 games in this genre yet. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Even the inns are a 🍋 little bit different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from the, 🍋 uh, rather, sort of, 🍊 out-of-place-looking 🍋 female innkeeper, here, 🍊 you get this little cutscene 🍋 of you relaxing at the inn. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, what's 🍋 with that music? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It reminds me very much 🍊 of the odd little, uh, 🍋 boogie theme from this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Undoubtedly, that's 🍋 just a coincidence. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I mentioned 🍊 the gameplay is a little 🍋 problematic at times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are some rather 🍋 frustrating moments 🍊 in the level design. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You often access new areas 🍊 through these odd 🍋 and inappropriate-🍋looking windows. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But you often land 🍋 right on [an] enemy 🍊 when you come up 🍋 the other side. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, you can't 🍋 jump over the enemy 🍊 because you'll jump 🍋 out the window again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's, uh, very difficult 🍊 to avoid getting 🍋 a few cheap hits. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this exact same problem 🍋 occurs multiple times. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The basic layout is that 🍋 there are several levels, 🍊 each slightly nonlinear 🍊 and each containing 🍋 the boss at the end. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Boss battles 🍋 are not fantastic, 🍊 but there is 🍋 one unique facet. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Do you see that Q.V. number 🍋 in the upper right? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's the boss's health. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, 🍋 in between levels 🍊 you get these weird 🍋 "Pac-Man"-like interludes 🍊 where ya transform into 🍋 some other character. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's rather weird. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, the boss' health 🍋 actually slowly increases 🍊 as you progress 🍋 throughout the level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So the quicker 🍋 you get to the boss, 🍊 the easier the 🍋 boss will be. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, money plays a 🍋 [pretty] big factor 🍊 in "Bio ... Dan...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies are 🍋 always dropping it 🍊 and you need it 🍋 to buy weapons 🍊 from various N.P.C.s 🍋 found here and there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You start with 🍋 your basic knife, 🍊 but you can rather 🍋 quickly get upgraded. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And when ya come to 🍋 this guy up ahead, 🍊 he'll actually sell you a 🍋 quote unquote 'Laser Disc'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a rather cool weapon, 🍊 um, but most of the better 🍋 weapons cost money to use. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, that's right; 🍋 using the Laser Disc 🍊 costs you $4 🍋 every time you throw it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This boss battle can be 🍋 a little bit tricky, 🍊 due to the wonky 🍋 jumping controls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have to move 🍋 forward a little bit 🍋 right before you jump... 🍊 and I often got stuck 🍋 while trying to clear 🍊 that little platform 🍋 in the middle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you die fighting a boss, 🍊 you will need 🍋 to use the exit 🍊 to transport you back 🍋 to earlier in the level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a little cruel. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So this is a very nice 🍋 attempt from Atlas 🍊 and, while it's 🍋 far from perfect, 🍊 you can tell a lot of effort 🍋 went into "Bio Senshi Dan", 🍊 giving it sort of a, uh, 🍋 a sheen of quality 🍊 missing from most of the 🍋 [typical] games in this genre. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ide Yosuke Meijin no Jissen Mahjong 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 24 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so there... 🍊 there's good news 🍋 and there's bad news. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Which do you want first? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The good news? 🍋 Okay. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We have a Capcom game. 🍋 Hurray! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But the bad news... 🍊 well, this is actually 🍋 a Mahjong Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Yep! It's 🍋 "Ide Yosuke Meijin 🍋 ... Jissen Mahjong". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Jissen Mahjong' 🍋 means something like 🍋 'Battle Mahjong'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, who is this 🍋 Ide Yosuke guy? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, he's a Mahjong player 🍋 who lent his name 🍊 to a whole series 🍋 of Mahjong Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess he's sort of 🍊 like the Mahjong 🍋 John Madden, I suppose. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Capcom actually 🍋 went all-out here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Rather than the D-Pad, 🍊 the game is controlled 🍋 by a special keyboard 🍊 that comes packaged 🍋 with the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Many Arcade 🍋 Mahjong video games 🍊 had keyboard interface; 🍊 it doesn't really 🍋 make much sense 🍊 to play Mahjong 🍋 with a joystick. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Capcom's deluxe treatment 🍊 drove the price 🍋 up to 6500 Yen, 🍊 making this one of the 🍋 most expensive titles 🍊 on the FamiCom so far. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hopefully the folks who 🍋 coughed up for this game 🍊 got their money's worth. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from that, this 🍋 appears to be the sort of 🍊 standard head-to-head 🍋 Mahjong action, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose the 🍋 existence of this game 🍋 will remind us that, 🍊 'Yeah, Capcom did 🍋 release stuff like this 🍋 for the Japanese market'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It wasn't all 🍋 'Street Fighter's 🍋 and 'Mega Man's. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Star Gate 🇯🇵 // Defender II 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 24 🇯🇵 // 1988 [?] [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Vid Kidz | HAL
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL 🇯🇵 // HAL America 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, here's one completely 🍋 out o' left field. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 HAL suddenly goes all retro 🍋 and releases a series of 🍊 ports of old Arcade Games 🍋 from Atari and Williams. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First up is "Star Gate". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In a time of larger 🍋 and larger cartridges, 🍊 "Star Gate"'s one of the 🍋 smallest for the system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The cart's [only] 🍋 128 kilobits 🍊 (that's right kilobits 🍋 - not kilobytes). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, obviously this 🍋 is a port of Williams' 🍋 1981 Arcade Shooter, 🍊 the sequel to "Defender", 🍋 originally developed 🍋 by Vid Kidz. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was also released 🍋 under the name 🍋 "Defender II". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Star Gate"'s 🍋 considered a classic 🍋 of early video games 🍊 but nowadays 🍋 the control scheme 🍊 seems overly 🍋 difficult to use. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The joystick [only] controls 🍋 your vertical movement; 🍊 a separate button 🍋 fires your thrusters 🍊 and another button 🍋 turns the ship around. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Altogether, "Star Gate" 🍋 had six buttons, by the way. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is to shoot 🍋 aliens and rescue humans 🍊 (and you're supposed 🍋 to catch the humans, 🍊 by the way, not shoot them 🍋 - easier said than done). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose six years 🍊 seems like a long time 🍋 in video game terms today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But in the 1980s 🍋 it was a lifetime. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Compare "Star Gate" 🍋 to "Salamander" 🍊 and just see how much 🍋 Shooters had changed 🍊 within that 🍋 five year period. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Sadly, the FamiCom version 🍋 isn't really Arcade-perfect. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 For example, 🍋 the radar screen doesn't 🍋 really show everything 🍊 and the enemies 🍋 are not as detailed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess overall 🍋 the port is decent. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, HAL didn't really sell 🍋 their games [in] the U.S. 🍊 but they did 🍋 release this one, 🍊 under the name 🍋 "Defender II". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, let's take a look 🍋 at something here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Does the opening music 🍋 sound kind of familiar? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, that's right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not really sure 🍋 how that came about. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the sprites have 🍋 been changed a little bit 🍊 for the U.S. version, 🍋 for some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also strange is the name of 🍋 Atari on the title screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is a Williams 🍋 game, not an Atari game, 🍊 but Atari Soft did port 🍋 the game to some computers 🍋 in the early '80s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Is this version 🍋 supposedly based on that? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know, 🍋 but it is a little odd. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kyonshiizu 2 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 25 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, folks. 🍊 Now we're starting to 🍋 [delve] into the truly obscure. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Taito has released 🍋 some weird games 🍊 (the Takeshi Kitano 🍋 game, for example) 🍊 and now this: 🍋 "Kyonshiizu 2". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Plenty of folks in the 🍋 West know Beat Kitano, 🍊 but "Kyonshiizu 2"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We're getting 🍋 [pretty] deep in 🍊 obscure Japanese 🍋 pop culture here, 🍊 so this might require 🍋 some explanation. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Kyonshiizu' 🍋 is the Japanese word 🍋 for 'jiangshi' 🍊 (what we in the West 🍋 call the Chinese 🍋 hopping vampire). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A number of Chinese 🍋 films were produced 🍊 in the 1980s and '90s, 🍋 featuring vampires. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The movie that 🍋 kicked off the trend 🍊 was the Sammo Hung-produced 🍋 "Mr. Vampire" from 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Mr. Vampire" is one 🍋 of the all time classics 🍊 of Hong Kong Action cinema. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And if you've 🍋 never seen it, 🍊 well see this movie 🍋 as soon as possible. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One low budget 🍋 "Mr. Vampire" knockoff 🍊 was the 1985 🍋 Taiwanese movie, 🍊 known as "Hello Dracula" 🍋 in the U.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were four 🍋 movies in this series 🍊 and they were 🍋 shown on Japanese TV 🍊 under the 'Kyonshiizu' name. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Kyonshiizu 2" is 🍋 the second movie 🍊 released in 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And that, of course, 🍊 is what this game 🍋 is based off of. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While you can find an 🍊 English-subtitled version 🍋 of "Hello Dracula" online, 🍊 I don't think an English 🍋 version to "Kyonshiizu 2" 🍊 actually exists. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So about Taito's game, 🍋 well, it falls into 🍊 the general category of the 🍋 Graphical Adventure Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most o' the game 🍋 takes place 🍊 in this rather 🍋 large Chinese city. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It really resembles 🍋 "[Kieta] Princess". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That was 🍋 Imagineer's obscure 🍋 FamiCom Disk System game; 🍊 we covered it 🍋 back in "...Episode 14". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So ya run around the city 🍋 talking to various folks, 🍊 buying items, and so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are tons of buildings 🍋 and shops in this game, 🍊 and quite a few people 🍋 to talk to. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You use the now-standard 🍋 Japanese Adventure Game 🍊 menu to interact 🍋 with the N.P.C.s. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing: 🍊 It's not always clear which 🍋 buildings can be entered, 🍊 and where the entrances are. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot o' times you just 🍋 run up against the wall 🍊 and that'll 🍋 allow you to enter. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, what's the 🍋 point of this game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I'm not really sure. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Certainly, it has something 🍋 to do with vampires. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You do encounter 🍋 vampires in the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 For example, you can 🍋 enter the guard towers, 🍊 and then move 🍋 along the ramparts, 🍊 and you will find 🍋 a vampire in here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, there are 🍋 Action sequences in the game 🍊 (these, uh, 🍋 side-scrolling sections) 🍊 where ya fight vampires 🍋 and other creatures. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These all seem 🍋 very simply done. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There're also all these, 🍋 uh, catacombs, uh, 🍊 of some sort 🍋 under the city, 🍊 and these can be accessed 🍊 through the various 🍋 manhole covers 🍊 that you see kind of, 🍋 ya know, around the ground. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly, the character design, 🍋 uh, in these sequences 🍊 reminds me a lot of 🍋 IREM's "Kung Fu" game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So "Kyonshiizu 2" 🍋 seems to be 🍊 sort of a complicated 🍋 Graphical Adventure Game 🍊 with poorly implemented 🍋 Action sequences. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Too bad! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Even in Japan, this game 🍋 seems mostly forgotten. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Salamander 🇯🇵 // Life Force 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 25 🇯🇵 // 1988 August [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, now we're talkin'! 🍋 "Salamander" - 🍊 Konami's sequel to Gradius. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's been a while 🍋 since we've seen 🍊 a good Shoot-'em-Up 🍋 on the FamiCom - 🍊 and this definitely 🍋 fits the bill. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, in the U.S., 🍋 we know this under the name 🍋 "Life Force". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyone who's 🍋 played "Gradius" 🍊 will immediately recognize 🍋 that Konami is referencing 🍋 the opening [of] that game 🍊 with these first few 🍋 waves of enemies here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Salamander" has 🍊 an unusually confusing 🍋 r... uh ...release history. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So let's take a look. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first version was this 🍋 Arcade release in Japan, 🍊 under the name 🍋 of "Salamander". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Notable features are 🍋 the speech samples 🍊 and the new 🍋 power-up system. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Rather than using 🍋 the "Gradius" system 🍋 of power-ups, 🍊 here enemies drop 🍋 frequent random power-ups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... This makes 🍋 pimping out the Vic Viper 🍊 a little bit easier. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can get Options, 🍋 Missiles, Lasers, etc. 🍊 within the first few 🍋 waves of enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The most striking visual 🍋 element of "Salamander" 🍊 was the fact that the first 🍋 level was designed 🍊 [as] if you are traveling 🍋 inside some sort 🍋 of living organism. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] first enemy 🍋 was a gigantic brain. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Konami must have 🍋 liked that concept 🍊 because they reworked 🍋 the game for U.S. arcades, 🍊 altering backgrounds 🍋 to make it look like 🍊 the entire game was inside 🍋 of the creature's body 🍊 and calling it "Life Force". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Then in 1987, 🍋 it was altered again 🍊 and re-released in arcades 🍋 in Japan as "Life Force" 🍊 (this time with new 🍋 backgrounds and new sprites 🍊 and using the old 🍋 "Gradius" powerup system). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also notable is 🍋 this M.S.X. port, 🍊 released in December 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This version features 🍋 a different plot, 🍋 redesigned game, 🍊 and a new and rather 🍋 dramatic introduction. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, oh yes, 🍋 your characters 🍋 have been renamed 🍊 after Iggy Pop and 🍋 David Bowie, of all people. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as for the 🍋 FamiCom version, 🍊 it's not really a 🍋 port of any of these. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It mostly resembles the 🍋 original "Salamander", 🍊 but has the "Gradius"-style 🍋 power-up system. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Some levels have 🍋 been removed 🍊 and other brand new levels 🍋 have been added in instead. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Sometimes "Salamander" 🍋 doesn't always play fair 🍊 (like here, for example, 🍋 where you can get stuck 🍊 behind this inch 🍋 of the wall 🍊 if you take 🍋 the lower path). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Japanese 🍋 Arcade "Life Force" 🍋 was [pretty] difficult, 🍊 due to the fact that it 🍋 was harder to power up 🍊 your ship, using the 🍋 "Gradius"-style system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each Option, for example, 🍋 required five power-ups. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The FamiCom version 🍋 isn't quite as difficult. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, once you're 🍋 fully powered up, 🍊 you can cut through 🍋 waves of enemies 🍊 like a hot knife 🍋 through butter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why? Well, two words: 🍋 Ripple Laser. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ripple Laser 🍋 plus three Options 🍊 turns the Vic [Viper] into 🍋 a flying wall of death. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's the first boss, 🍋 the Brain Golem. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The whole organic 🍋 feel to this level 🍊 would be exploited 🍋 to great effect 🍊 in the IREM game, "R-Type", 🍊 which came out 🍋 in Arcades in 1987. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, quite frankly, 🍋 if you have the Ripple, 🍊 uh, three Options, 🍋 and the Missiles 🍊 most bosses can be beaten 🍊 without even 🍋 breaking a sweat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah, you gotta shoot 🍋 this guy in the eye. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One unusual thing 🍋 about "Salamander" 🍊 is that it alternates 🍊 between horizontal 🍋 and vertical levels 🍊 (breaking from the 🍋 "Gradius" tradition). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing is: 🍋 I... I do apologize 🍊 if this video looks a 🍋 little weird at times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 Watching this in 30 🍋 frames per second 🍊 means [some things] 🍋 are not quite captured 🍊 the way they should be 🍋 and sometimes the, uh, 🍊 action looks a 🍋 little bit flickery. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And sometimes 🍋 you can't see 🍊 all the missiles 🍋 being fired. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And sometimes also 🍋 the Force Field 🍊 does cause some 🍋 graphical problems 🍋 as well in the video. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, other than 🍋 the first level, uh, 🍊 the most impressive 🍋 one is actually 🍊 this one right here: 🍋 the Fire Level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Truly awesome! 🍊 (and obviously inspired the 🍋 beginning of "Gradius II") 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] first time you see 🍊 one of those gigantic arcs 🍋 of the flame leap up, 🍊 your jaw will 🍋 hit the ground 🍊 (and you will probably 🍋 be killed as well). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, that is [pretty] cool. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So here's a question: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why is this called 🍋 'Salamander' in Japan? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What do those little 🍋 amphibious creatures 🍊 have anything to do 🍋 with alien invasions? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, ya know, 🍊 while the salamander 🍋 is a real-life animal, 🍊 it's also applied to 🍋 a legendary creature, uh, 🍊 usually depicted as some 🍋 sort of lizard or dragon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The salamander was said 🍋 to have an affinity to fire 🍊 (though there is 🍋 some confusion here). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Supposedly the 🍋 salamander was so cold 🍊 it could actually withstand 🍋 fire, even put fires out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But sometimes 🍋 it was thought of 🍊 [as] being sort of like 🍊 a fiery or fire-🍋breathing lizard. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍊 This use of the 🍋 word 'salamander' 🍊 turns up in video games 🍋 from time to time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Konami presumably had 🍋 this in mind since, uh, 🍊 fire and lizards and 🍋 fire-breathing lizards 🍊 kinda feature 🍋 in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here's one 🍋 of the new levels 🍊 (a ribcage and a skull). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On a technical note, 🍋 while "Salamander" is 🍊 visually, uh, very 🍋 impressive to look at 🍊 (you know, great colors 🍋 and huge bosses 🍋 and tons of projectiles) 🍊 sometimes there can 🍋 be a bit of slowdown 🍋 when ya fire weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 ([Of] course, sometimes this 🍋 is to your advantage.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Salamander" is not 🍋 perfect, by any means. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍋 The home version 🍊 does feature this odd 🍋 Egyptian-themed level, 🍊 uh, which requires 🍋 you to navigate past 🍊 some walls and columns 🍋 and that sort of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a bit annoying 🍋 and the setting 🍊 really makes no 🍋 sense whatsoever. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, the plot 🍋 is a little vague. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The U.S. manual states 🍋 you're flying through 🍊 the body of this gigantic 🍋 world-eating alien, Zelos, 🍊 and the final boss is 🍋 actually his heart and soul. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The M.S.X. version 🍋 gives a completely 🍋 different story, however. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One nice feature: 🍋 2-Player Co-Op. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A second player can control 🍊 the absurdly named, uh, 🍋 well, 'Lord British' 🍊 (I guess someone 🍋 was an "Ultima" fan). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But Konami's typically lame 🍋 manual for the U.S. version 🍊 calls him 'RoadBritish'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Though slowdown, of course, 🍊 would be an even 🍋 bigger issue 🍊 with the two ships. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the final boss 🍋 (in the "Gradius" tradition) 🍋 is, uh, actually [pretty] easy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you make your slow 🍋 and dramatic approach, 🍊 you'll see he's actually 🍋 [pretty] darn impressive-looking. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 He actually returns 🍋 in the FamiCom version 🍋 of "Gradius II". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, hopefully you have 🍋 some lives left over, 🍊 since this game has 🍋 a rather nasty bit 🍋 of surprise at the end. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But all-in-all "Salamander" 🍋 and "Life Force": uh, 🍊 one of the best 🍋 Shooters for the FamiCom 🍊 and quite an achievement. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, in, 🍋 uh, every Konami game, 🍊 it ends with the bad 🍋 guys' base blowing up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As the FamiCom was becoming 🍊 sort of more and more geared 🍋 towards original titles, 🍊 and Platformers, 🍋 and Action R.P.G.s, 🍊 and that sort of thing 🍊 we're seeing fewer and fewer, 🍋 like, big name Arcade titles 🍊 coming to the system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, uh, "Salamander"'s 🍋 definitely one of the 🍋 exceptions to the rule. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Spy Hunter 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bally Midway | Sunsoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's those weirdos 🍋 at Sunsoft again, 🍊 this time with their 🍋 first U.S.-[only] release: 🍊 a port of Bally Midway's 🍋 1983 Arcade classic, 🍊 "Spy Hunter". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The home version gets this 🍋 nifty new title screen, 🍊 but no one felt compelled 🍊 to actually have any music 🍋 for the game's intro. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That is often 🍋 (though not always) 🍊 a sign that this was 🍋 sort of a rushed release. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Presumably, Sunsoft 🍋 wanted to get in on 🍊 the rapidly opening console 🍋 game market in the U.S. 🍊 and didn't feel any of 🍋 their existing titles 🍋 would have been suitable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know if 🍋 you've noticed, 🍊 but all of the SunSoft games 🍋 we've seen so far 🍊 have been Japan-[only] releases. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here's the 🍋 original Arcade version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was a very popular 🍋 game at the time, uh, 🍊 but much of it had to do 🍋 with the arcade cabinet. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It had] a very cool 🍋 steering wheel controller 🍊 and each of the weapons 🍋 had its own button 🍊 on the steering 🍋 wheel itself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it looked kind of like 🍊 the wheel you would 🍋 actually expect 🍊 a tricked-out 🍋 spy car to have. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a two-speed 🍋 gearshift knob. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 What set "Spy Hunter" 🍋 apart from other games 🍊 were your car's weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Entering the Weapons Van 🍊 will get you outfitted 🍋 with some extra weapons 🍊 (like, uh, the Oil Slick, 🍋 the Smoke Screen, 🍋 and Missiles). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, the 🍋 N.E.S. version 🍊 suffers a bit graphically, 🍊 uh, but still looks better 🍋 than earlier ports. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Spy Hunter" 🍋 had been released 🍊 for virtually every platform 🍋 in the world at this point 🍊 (the 2600, Colecovision, 🍋 various computers, ...) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The 2600 release was 🍋 published by Sega, 🍊 of all people. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This port seems sort of, 🍋 ooh, I don't know... 🍋 so-so(?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's reasonably 🍋 accurate to the original, 🍊 but doesn't really seem like 🍋 a fleshed-out console game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Presentation isn't 🍋 too impressive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The special weapons 🍋 seem a little lame 🍊 (just look at the smoke 🍋 screen for example). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like the 🍋 Arcade version, 🍊 it does use the Peter Gunn 🍋 Theme as background music. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 But there are long 🍋 silent sections. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And not much really 🍋 happens in the game; 🍊 I mean you drive 🍋 over land, bridges, 🍊 and occasionally 🍋 turn into a boat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then there are signs 🍊 that the game was actually, 🍋 sort of, hastily ported. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍊 Various glitches 🍋 do appear. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably the most notorious 🍋 is the fact that at times 🍊 your car can go off-road 🍊 and drive through all 🍋 the scenery unharmed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When this happens, 🍋 s... s... uh, "Spy Hunter" 🍊 becomes kinda like the 🍊 "Big Rigs: 🍋 Over the Road Racing" 🍋 of its day. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, I'd say 🍋 "Spy Hunter" just sort of 🍊 loses something 🍋 in the transition 🍊 from an Arcade Game 🍊 (with its specialized 🍋 spy car controls) 🍊 to an N.E.S. game, played 🍋 at home on the D-Pad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just really don't 🍋 feel like a 'spy hunter', 🍋 playing this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 22 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 There we go, 🍋 another 15 games down! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing about this month 🍋 (and maybe you noticed): 🍊 we [only] had one 🍋 FamiCom Disk System game - 🍊 and it was from Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Disk System's glory 🍋 days are already behind it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, don't get me wrong; 🍊 we'll still be seeing 🍋 plenty of F.D.S. games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But after late 1986 and 🍋 the first half of 1987, 🍊 the number of disks 🍋 being released 🍊 will be steadily diminishing 🍊 and we'll see fewer 🍋 big name titles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So I hope you'll 🍋 join us next time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And hopefully 🍋 we'll be seeing 🍊 "Chrontendo Episode 23" 🍋 in a more timely fashion. 🍇🍌
