👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 18 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once again welcome to '*Chrontendo*'; this is "...Episode *18*" [and we're] now looking [at] *May* [and] *June* of [*1987*]. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 This time around, we have the typical sort of goodies, *including* some *rather* obvious *knockoffs* of [popular *titles*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There, of course, is *also* a [title] from [*Konami*], as well [as] an [interesting] one from *Capcom*, and *even* a very minor release from Nintendo themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess, let's [get] *cracking*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hao-Kun no Fushigina Tabi 🇯🇵 // Mystery Quest 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 May 01 🇯🇵 // 1989 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Carry Laboratory 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by DOG 🇯🇵 // Taxan 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once *again*, here we are [with] the [first] *game* of another *episode*, [and] *this [title]* is another *D.O.G.* release, "Hao-[Kun] no [Fushigi] na Tabi" (or 'Hao's Mystery [*Adventure*]'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this is the *[only] FamiCom game* from developer *Carry* Lab. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} [*plot*] is actually told in these opening *illustrations*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A young wizard's *apprentice* is sent [out to] find, uh, the magical six *symbols* - each one being *hidden* in (of course) *the castle*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As the game *starts*, [it] *certainly* [doesn't] *look* very impressive. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 As your green haired character stroll a *[pretty] generic* looking video game *world*, you [will immediately] find a *scroll* [that] allows you to [shoot] *projectiles*, [and] then the game *proper begins*. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 "*Hao's* Mystery [Adventure]" *is a* very [straightforward] side scoring [*platform with*] a [little bit] of "...Zelda" thrown in [for] good *measure*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll either jump *over* or [shoot your] *enemies* (typical, uh, things [such as] bats, hedgehogs, {and} so on, {and} so *forth) [while] searching* for invisible helpful [items] (stars [for] *health*, a magic lamp [for] *invincibility*, a little Hao figure to extend [your] *Vitality Bar*, [and] so on, [and] so forth). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 At the end of each [*somewhat*] lengthy level you'll enter a *castle*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 (Oh, [note] the [little], uh, D.O.G. zeplin [floating] in the sky *there*.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *inside* the castle you'll need [to] find [one of] the symbols, [defeat] some bosses, [and] then pick up [an item that's] required to advance. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [What] *I* wanna know is, what the hell [happened to] the *trees* [in] this town? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Apparently] someone *came along* [and] *chopped off* the *tops* [of] *every single one*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [little] stars [are items that *slightly*] refill [your] *Vitality*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, [and] those [little] arrow signs [are] actually checkpoints. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This way is *blocked* so it's *inside* the *castle* [and that will] allow us [to proceed]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the [*outside*] levels [are *completely] linear*, [but] the [*castles* require] a [*bit*] more poking around. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 There are dead [ends], hidden behind passages, [and] *so on*; [they] are a [bit] mazey-like, I suppose. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Entering a door [will] take you [into] the *boss's* room, and *each castle* has *four* [identical] bosses. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the [first] castle is a -- a *rat* [or] maybe a *bear*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Later] on, ya have [*beetles*], squids, dragons, [and] *so* on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then ya [get] a *key* [that enables you to *exit*] the *room*, [and] a *moon* [that] refills [your] health [*entirely*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The moons [are often] *hidden* inside of blocks à la "*Castlevania*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, this *was* the [only] *game* [for] the FamiCom from the *relatively* minor Japanese developer, *Carry* Labs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They formed [in *1981* and] released a number of games [for] Japanese [*computers*, mostly] the *FM-7*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Really nothing [particularly] *distinguished* [about] them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was one of their [later] *games, since* they folded in [1988]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's the final door [to exit the] *castle, there*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Then [you're]* back outside {in} the *world* [and] you [can] continue to move on. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Once [ya get to] the [*first*] castle you'll [have found] some *boots* and able [to] *smash* certain *blocks* [and] this [will] allow ya to [progress past] this, uh, earlierly, uh, *unpassable*, uh, *obstacle*, here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *as ya* may [have] noticed, "*Hao's* Mystery [Adventure]" *borrows* [pretty] shamefully from the iconography of "*Super [Mario]* Bros.", (stacks of blocks, castles, flowers, stars, the [occasional bottomless] pit, [*that* sorta] thing). 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's [*not*] nearly as *good* [as] "Super Mario *Bros.*" [it's really not that] *bad*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The controls work reasonably well; your goals are [*pretty*] clearly laid *out*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's nothing jarringly *awful* [about] the *game*. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 The game is [somewhat] *repetitive*, alternating [between] castles [and] *overworld* (six *times* and all). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [just found] the [symbol of] *health* there (which is [*apparently*] a No *Smoking* sign). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Shooting] the flowers [won't] grant you any *power*-ups [but] rather [just], uh, [some extra *points*]. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Now, *once* you've [gotten past] the [second] *castle*, there [is, sort] of, a chain pace here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [drop] down a *pit*, [and *then* the] game switches to [an] underground *world*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Again, this* seems *[pretty] much* [straight out] of "...*Mario*...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*And*] there we go. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [So], the game is divided roughly in, [sort of], three large areas: one above ground [and] *two* underground. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, *this did get* a U.S. *release*, under the name of "*Mystery* Quest", by *Taxan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's [the] new, boring, ugly [*title*] screen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 A *big chunk* [of] the game (*actually* the *entire* last *third*) was [removed], so [it] ma... -- [it] *was* made [quite] a [bit shorter and] easier. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *music* {and} the *sound* effects [are], uh, *[slightly] altered* [but *pretty] much* looks the same. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Seiken Psycho Calibur 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 May 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by C-Lab 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Imagineer 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So if* [that last] game bore resemblance to "Super *Mario Bros.", this one might* remind you of *another* popular Nintendo [title]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The rather odd [*title* of] this game is "*Seiken* Psycho Calibur..." (absolutely no relationship to "Seiken *Densetsu*", unfortunately). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 '*Seiken*', by the way, means 'Holy Sword'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As for '*Psycho Calibur*', well, who knows? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some kind of reference to *Excalibur*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's *my guess*, based on the rather odd spelling of '*calibur*'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is certainly neither the first *nor* the last time we'll see the animated *gleam* on the sword in a video game intro. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [onto] the game itself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hmm! Well, this looks *familiar*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 I've seen those trees *before*, somewhere. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Oh* yes, this looks just like "...Legend of *Zelda*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once ya start *playing* the game, "Seiken Psycho Calibur..." does *nothing* [to] shake off the "...Zelda" *association*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It plays [exactly] *like "...Zelda"*, which was released 14 months *prior* [to] this. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 A [*lot*] of "...Zelda"-inspired games have been released, [but] *really none* [had] the *cajones* to really imitate "...Zelda" so [*blatantly*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While this game was released by *Imagineer*, [it] was [developed] by a [little] company called *C-Lab*, who did a number of games *mostly* for Imagineer [and] some *other* companies. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 And they can continued to exist for [quite] a while making the games, the number of consoles [and] cell phones [and that sorta] thing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, there is [an] unofficial [English] *translation* [of] this game (*and a rather* nicely *done* one [at] *that*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, we [can] read the opening narration [and get an] idea of [*what*] this is actually *about*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's evil spreading across the land, {the} legendary hero to emerge, *you know [pretty much* exactly as] we would *expect*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [*despite*] the obvious similarities to "...Zelda", *there actually* are a few *differences*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, *here* you [collect] money from *monsters* ([represented] by those blue *jewels*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *But* borrowing a [concept] from old, old, *old* R.P.G.s, you have *food* [as] well (which is those, uh, [*pink*] jewels, which are [constantly *depleting*]). 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 The whole thing, uh, of needing [to] have food [or] else to die of starvation is thankfully obsolete in most modern *R.P.G.s*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] *increase* [your] *Power* (that's your Life Bar) or your *Force* ([which is your] attack) through that *training* room you saw a [moment] ago. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have to buy [your] way [to get into] that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There are little sc... -- *houses* [scattered] around where ya [can] buy [items or get some *advice*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Your first order [of] business [is to] rescue this, uh, *fairy* Princess that's being held *prisoner*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You do this by killing the [first] *boss* [and] then [getting] a *key*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 *Here's* one of your items [screen]; I [found] some, uh, *bombs, there*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *There's a boss* {at} the [end] of each level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is *much* more *linear* [than] "... Zelda". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Basically, ya, sort of, walk [your] way across [the] level [to] get [to] the *end boss* then move on [to] the *next* one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well, "Seiken...Calibur..." is* a [decently] managed *game*, even though it's, uh, gameplay is, uh, [certainly] inferior [to] "...*Zelda*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Despite*] the similarities of *design*, [it's] *nowhere* near [as] *compelling* [as] "... Zelda". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The enemies [aren't] very interesting [and] the levels are *[pretty] uninspired*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] it's [not] actually a *bad* game, so *those* who [are] *interested* in [straightforward] *"... Zelda" clones* [might find] something to *enjoy* here. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Youkai Club 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 May 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here's* another [little] entry in the low rent knockoffs of [popular *titles*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That] *seems* [to] be the *theme* [for] this episode. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's "*Youkai Club*" from *Jaleco*! 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 *Our [little title]*, [not] sure exactly [what it] means. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A 'youkai' is, [sort] of, a, uh, Japanese *[spirit] creature* (often [quite] *weird* looking). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [might remember] Bandai's "GeGeGe no *Kitaro*..." [released in] early [*1986* and] which came [out in] the U.S. [as] "Ninja *Kid*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That] game *also* concerned youkai. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [What] a 'Youkai *Club' is* [I'm not] really *sure*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *here* we have [your] typical faceless heroic tough *guy*, [apparently out to] destroy some youkai, armed with [only] his trusty daggers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Right] away*, ya [might get] a [mild] feeling of deja *vu*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Youkai Club" *[certainly] resembles "Castlevania"*, though [with] its [endlessly] vertical scrolling *levels* [it] also borrows a bit [from] "Kid *Icarus*". 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 *But* unlike "Castlevania" [and] "Kid Icarus", *the levels* [are] kind of clumsy designed [and] a *[bit] boring. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 I [don't] know if I'd even really call that a *midboss*, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] *kill [it]*, like, in, uh, *two* [or] three *shots*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} [not] really sure [if that] character really deserves its own *room*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *music* is [decent], I guess. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Uh... But "Youkai..." *definitely looks*, uh, a [little bit] on the cheap side. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 *So anyway, after* a [bit] of a jumping [and] dagger k... -- tossing *you'll eventually* get the first real boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He [should] be up here in [just] a moment. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Oh!* One nice thing - ya *can*, uh, throw your daggers [right] through *walls*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 When [you kill an enemy] you collect -- collect, uh -- collect those [little] red *balls* there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Okay*, so *here's* the [first] boss - *sort* of] a *weird* looking *guy* - a [*bit* of] a *pain*, actually. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For a *guy* wearing *robes*, he *sure* can *jump* [all over] the place. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 You know, [sort] of "Kid Icarus" the difficulty kind of mellows *out of it* as we [get into] more the traditional *side-scrolling* stuff. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I should mention that aside from, uh, killing everything [that] moves, *you will* occasionally pick up an *object* (like a *key* or a *power-up* [or] something like [that]). 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Not to [mention] the usual stuff, uh, health refills, temporary invincibility, [and] even a *star* (that gives you, uh, sort of, pre-"Ninja Gaiden" that sort of shadow selves that allows you {to} throw more daggers at once). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well, here* we finally wandered into the ubiquitous *forest* level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game [kind of alternates between] these, [sort of], levels, [and] then the more vertically *oriented* levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess [it] *does* [remind] me a [bit] of "Kid Icarus". 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 *Jaleco is* [ pretty] good making half-decent Action Platformer type games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, that's *exactly* [what] "Youkai Club" *is*, a *half*-[decent] game. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Not *exceptional*, [but] it's certainly worth *playing* if you're [*into*] this sorta *thing*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *controls* [are not] really [that] easy-[to]-use. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 [As] I've [*mentioned* before], people [tend to] complain [about] the [first] "*Castlevania*" game is having weird *controls*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But *compared* [to] a [*lot* of] these *other* games, [I] mean, [they're] *very good*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This one*, [for] example, uh, *controlling* [your] character is [certainly not] *too easy*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing* is, when he *jumps*, he [can actually, sort of], stay in the air for a [little bit and sort of] *move* while he's [at] the height of his jump. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess that's, uh, *useful* [at] times. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 But, *on the other* hand, there certainly, sort of, [not] standard jumping controls. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 I guess [as is] befitting for a game of a title like "[Youkai] Club", um, eventually, there's [sort of], like, a Japanese [kind] of *theme* to some [of] the environments. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We [sort] of [reach] what's [apparently] some [sort of] ninja villade w-th -- village with, like, uh, [sort] of, [little] foxes running [around and that] sorta thing. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Even get -- [to, sort] of, go down a well "...Mario..."-style {and} [fight] a few more things. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Take a look at these scenes, you'll definitely see some [pretty] heavy "Castlevania" influences in some of their designs. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And [*beyond that*], I *[don't] really* have [that] much [to] *say* [about] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [*pretty] unremarkable*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I'll just go ahead [and let] the video run [for a little bit] longer, [in] case you're [*interested* in] seeing [what] this thing *looks* like. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dynamite Bowl 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 May 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Softvision International 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toshiba EMI 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Now* let's plumb the depths of the [forgotten and] * useless* with "*Dynamite Bowl*" from the *record company*, Toshiba E.M.I., who [had] *also* given us the first ever *Pachinko* Game for the *FamiCom*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 [*And*] the rather odd "*Bird* Week" (which was the first ever bird fitting Simulation Game for the *FamiCom*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Now*, it's "*Dynamite* Bowl", the first ever *Bowling* Game [for] the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, while they [don't make] good games, [at] least, uh, Toshiba put, sort of, new *things* on the *system*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Since* the cover features a *gorilla* holding a *bomb* with a burning *fuse* you [might] *think* this was going [to] be [an] interesting [and] exciting game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *no*, it's a [mostly] by-the-numbers *Bowling Game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [Pretty] much the most [interesting] thing is up [to] five players [can] *compete*. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 So, you choose [your] character, choose [your] *ball weight*, choose the *lane number*, though all the lanes [are] all the *same*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Then ya [do] the simple, uh, lineup [your] character, [hit] the [buttons to] control the direction [and] power (much like Nintendo's "*Golf*"), [*and*] there ya *go*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [There's] actually a second game option where ya try [to get] strikes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [There] really *haven't* been *too* many console Bowling Games prior [to this]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] guess there were some [for older] systems like the *2600*, as far as *I* recall. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess [it gets] points [for *originality*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Dynamite Bowl" was [developed] by the obscure *Softvision International*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was *their [only] FamiCom game*, though they *did* release a few *Genesis* games. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Funny looking [at] this, this is really [isn't] all [that different] from the bowling *Wii* Sports (other [than], of course, uh, the *controls*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or [for that] matter, the bowling in, uh, "Grand Theft Auto *IV*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess *Bowling Games* really haven't *evolved* [that] much in the [last 20] years. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Section-Z 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 May 25 🇯🇵 // 1987 July [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Okay*, so *nothing too exciting* this episode *so far*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *here's* one ya [might] *recognize*, as [it] was [released] in the U.S. for the *N.E.S.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's Capcom's "Section *Z*". 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Thing is, [didn't] Capcom just release a game last *month*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [don't get] *too* [excited]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's actually] gonna be a while [before] we see another major release [from] Capcom, *but* when that [title] *does* arrive, it's a *doozy*. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 [At] *any* [rate], *going* back to [today's] Capcom *game, "Section* Z" is a *Horizontal [Shooter]* that began like as [an] Arcade Game in [1985]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *The* original version is [*pretty straightforward*; you just] kinda fly [and shoot] everything [that comes your] *way*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 The *feature* [that] made "Section Z" a [*little different*] from [*most* Shooters], is by hitting the [*second button*, your] character would *turn around* [and] face the other *direction*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Thus making [it, *sort*] of, a *predecessor* [to] "... Side Arms" {and} "[Forgotten] *Worlds", which were* released in arcades by Capcom in [1986 and 1988, *respectively*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Some sections also found you moving in a [*vertical*] direction, *though [still]* facing *sideways*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 *[Your] goal* is [to] make [your] way [through] these alphabetic in sections, all the way [to] the *final level*, Section *Z*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Last* episode, *we saw* how *Capcom* [completely] reworked "Pirate Ship *Higemaru*" for home *release*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 And they do exactly the same thing *this time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hmm! This looks a [little bit] like "*Gradius*", [doesn't it]? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, since {the} FamiCom [couldn't replicate] the rather cool backgrounds on the *Arcade* [title], the *overall* look [of] the game was changed, [*not* to] mention the enemies and [your] character were [*redesigned*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Additionally*, uh, the *bombs* [that] you drop were [removed from your] arsenal. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 And it [*actually* doesn't] really [start] out very *impressive looking*. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Like I mentioned, [it] does kind of resembles [sort] of a minor "Gradius" rip-off *from the first few levels*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *here's the thing*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 "Section Z" is made of a bunch of [shorter] *levels - 60* all together. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And at] the *end of each* level, there [are] two *teleporter* beams, which [will] take ya to a [different] *level*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *depending* on whether you choose the top or the [bottom] *teleporter* [will] depend on which level ya go to *next*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Furthermore, certain* [teleporters will actually] be *blocked*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [To make] *progress* [in] the game, you'll have to *unblock* the [teleporters] by destroying a [*generator*]. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 *These [generators]* function as, [sort] of, *mini*-bosses [in] the game. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 They shoot [these little] *homing* missiles, [but] you [can] use the, uh, [*platforms*] there to, uh, avoid the missiles... hopefully. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Now, *once* you've destroyed the [generator], *you'll [get]* a [little] life extension bar, and you'll need [to] go back to an [*earlier*] level, [in order] to access the [previously] closed [*teleporter*] beam. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Some* [generators are virtually *impossible* to defeat] unless you've [found certain] *power-ups* (for example, the *shield*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike in [*most* Shoot]-'em-Ups the *power-ups* [aren't just, sort] of, randomly dropped [all over the] place [but *only] appear* on [certain] *levels*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 So, [you need to] scour the game as many sections in order [to remain] stocked *up*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *still*, "*Section* Z" is *very* much *nonlinear*. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This [will] show [excellent] use of the, uh, *shield*, [right] here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] usually many possible *paths* you [can take to get *through*] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] skip *some* sections *entirely*, [and] you'll [*frequently*] have [to] go back [to] earlier *sections*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 There [are] a *number* of sections [that *can't*] be skipped, like those with generators or] *bosses* in 'em. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One [complaint* about] "Section Z": the *bosses* [aren't] really too [exciting]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For the most part] they're [pretty] small, and they're usually [defeated] by a [lot] of [button] mashing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*later*] bosses get a [bit] *tougher*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing* [that's] a [little] *odd* [about] "Section *Z*" is it's *still called* "Section *Z*" even though *section* no longer have *letters*; they now have *numbers*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Like], here's Section [39, for] example; think -- as I think I mentioned *earlier* the [last] section is Section [*60*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] the *U.S.* version, they [put a little bit] of extra plot [into] the [description] found [in] the *booklet*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Early Capcom game is released in the 'Captain Commando *Challenge* Series'. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 (I guess suppose is what Capcom *stood* for - 'Captain *Commando*'.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So [in this] game, you [and] Captain *Commando* are somehow teaming up [to defeat] these *aliens*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} plot description found [in] the [instruction booklet *doesn't*] really make a lot [of] sense. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Eventually*, of course, Capcom [dropped] the whole, uh, 'Captain Commando' business. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *These sections here kinda* remind me of, like, "*Salamander*"; they have, like, [that sort] of organic 'inside an alien being' type feel, uh -- feel to 'em, so it's that kind of, like, the sillier, [sort] of, uh, background there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Here we're coming up to *another* boss. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 *Actually* upgraded my weapon to, uh, the *[most] powerful* [in] the game, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] a [little bit] trickier [to get] because you have {to} [get certain] weapons [and] then [get them] a [second] *time*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *This enemy* [is] a [bit] of a *pain*. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Once you hit him enough, he breaks through these smaller *sections* [that] keep [following] you *around* and *shooting* at you [but] they *also* keep appearing [and] disappearing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes they, like, reappear [right] on *top* of you or, [sort] of, trap you in a *corner*. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 But you *can* take a number of hits from *bullets* (ya know, that's your, uh, your *Life* Bar, there) uh, even touching a single [enemy] will kill you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, Capcom appears to [have] borrowed a page [or] two from "*Metroid*" [while designing] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Aside] from the nonlinear structure [and] *backtracking*, the environment have sort of a "Metroid" kind of feel have a boss even called "L Brain". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This last] boss is actually *[pretty] annoying* [because] it's guarded by a *shield* which must be [*destroyed* but] re-appears after every couple {of} *seconds*. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 *So*, while "Section D" is, *[sort] of*, a classic, *[not] everyone likes it*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... It's -- As a [*Shooter*, it] focuses more [on] *exploration* [than typical *shooting*] action. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's [*definitely* not] everyone's cup of *tea*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This idea has been attempted [*before*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You remember the, uh, scroll R.P.G. Shooter, "*Galg*", from, uh, oh, numerous episodes ago? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] I *think* "Section Z" is really the [first] game to do this idea successfully. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pro Golfer Saru - Kage no Tournament 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 May 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We are in the midst of a Bandai blitz here, with three games released in the month of May. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} first was the Kinnikuman game covered last episode. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 And now we are very proud to bring you a "Pro Golfer Saru - Kage no Tournament" (or 'Pro Golfer Saru - Tournament of Shadows'). 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 And you're probably wondering what the hell is up with that crazy monkey dude with a crop jeans on the cover? 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Well, 'Pro Golfer Saru' is the long-running manga and animated T.V. series created by [Fujiko] Fujio (the same team that created 'Doremon'). 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 There were also a feature length anime based on the series and, um, well, I think you know how Bandai operates by now. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game was released in conjunction with one of those films. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, Saru is this is, sort of, feral child monkey boy, with a pure natural talent for golf, and various magical mysterious golfing based adventures. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 This game is a practice mode, where you pat around and try to hit the demons with your golf balls. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... For some reason, I'm very -- getting a very severe hook on this level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hitting the demons will net you some special abilities during the real game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 After practice, there is the standard 18 hole golf course for one or two players. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, well, do you remember the F.C.I. game, "Lunar Pool"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Pro Golfer Saru..." is, sort of, like that, but for golf. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Rather than realistic golf, everything is in one of these crazy courses with, uh, huge lakes, greens on top of plateaus, animals infesting the courses, and so on. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The actual golfing mechanism is, um, how should we say 'borrowed' from Nintendo's "Golf" game from 1984. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 When you swing, you hit the button once to control the power then again when the pointer is in the sweet spot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can actually use the D-Pad to control the direction of the swing while the ball is in midair. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The control scheme is completely unoriginal, but at least the course design is, uh, (well, it's) unlike any other Golf Games. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Um... There [are] tons of hazards [and] pitfalls and, uh, you often need to land the ball in some small islands surrounded by bottomless pits. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The animals, tornadoes, [et] cetera can interfere with your shots. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] is definitely extreme golf. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, like [pretty] much every other Golf Game, putting can be tricky. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You saw, for example, those meddlesome gophers on the screen a minute ago (kind of like, uh, "Caddyshack"). 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 The ball can do some weird stuff, uh, presumably due to the slope of the green. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes not hitting the ball hard enough will cause it to roll right back at you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The tournament gets even weirder in the second half of the course. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Saru decide [to do] some urban golfing from rooftop to rooftop. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Do you remember the, uh, Dinosaur Jr. video that had the same idea? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, "...Saru..." is a -- surprisingly not a bad game for a Bandai title, especially since it was developed by Tose. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 While Tose does a lot of crap, they can turn out competent work if they want to. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 While it's not technically as well done as any [of] the Nintendo 'Golf' games (oh, which another is coming up in the next episode, by the way) these creative courses, uh, are [pretty] fun to play. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's definitely worth checking out. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Trainer: Jogging Race 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 May 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Whoa! We are going Bandai crazy this episode - two games in a row! 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 "Family Trainer: Jogging Race" is the fourth game in Bandai is Family Trainer series. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You 'Chrontendo' veterans may recall that the Family Trainer was the Japanese version of the Power Pad (that thing you put on the floor and jump on). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo was so impressed by the system that they picked up the U.S. rights and rebranded it as the Power Pad. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then, of course, later, they used a similar idea for the, uh, Wii Fit Balance Board. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There weren't that many Power Pad games released here in the U.S., uh, but as for the "Family Trainer", well, that is a whole 'nother story. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Bandai released a whole bunch [of] games (like this one, for example) that were [only] sold in Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now "...Jogging Race" is very simple - you stand on the pad and jog in place (sort of like real jogging, [only], it'll make the downstairs neighbors angry). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The most interesting feature is the, uh, constantly changing background which, sort of, add a bit of realism to the proceedings. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I think this is supposed to be the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, which I know is also surrounded by a moat. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 It will actually take you a long time to jog all the way around; you sorta have the, uh, little map there and they'll be nice little details like other joggers, and so on, and so forth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "...Jogging Race" is sort of unique, in [that it] recreates the real -- a real world location in some detail. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess it's, sort of, like, uh, the "Grand Theft Auto IV" of 1987. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The other game, "Marathon", is much more baffling. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I do not understand the controls. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Your character keeps stopping and starting while doing that weird, sort of, uh, palms up motion. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you don't r... -- just run on the pad like you would expect. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... You really, sort of, have to stand off and get back on the, uh, the buttons again. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 It's quite bizarre; I really don't know what to make of this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once again, this [is] developed by Human and I guess the, uh, programming is [pretty] high-quality. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Even though the game itself isn't, ya know, too terribly interesting. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Meikyuu Jiin Dababa 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 May 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another 'Chrontendo' episode, another Konami game (well two if ya count the game after this one). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But our big Konami published game this time is "Meikyuu Jiin Dababa" ('Maze Temple Dababa'). 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 (Perhaps not as exciting as the, uh, last episode "Ai Senshi Nicol", but a good (if unusual) game.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Konami once again proves themselves kings of the opening prologue. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Just like "...Nicol", we have the kidnapped girlfriend style plot being set up in this little sequence. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 You have [pretty] decent music there. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Uh... These [kinds of] things we're often seeing [in] Arcade Games were still [sort of] infrequent in console titles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Games released for home systems had the luxury of coming with booklets to explain {the} plot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Gradually, this would change. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And we'll soon seen -- see games with, uh, much more elaborate openings [and] cutscenes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But [for] now [that] was [about as good as it] gets. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing that sets "...Dababa" apart was the, uh, Indian themed game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, "...Dababa" is the, uh, standard Konami "...Zelda"-like top-down non-scrolling Adventure Game (uh, just like "...Nicol" or "King Kong II...") but with one unusual quirk: your character can [only] jump - not walk. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a grid laid down on the floor, and your character and the enemies move by jumping from square to square. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 {You} can't change directions or stop at mid-jump, so be mindful of where the enemies are jumping; uh, that is of paramount importance. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can shoot projectiles to destroy enemies [but it's] best to do so from a distance so no one lands on ya [while you're] firing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Each section is a few screens tall and wide but much smaller than levels [in] games like "King Kong...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They tend [to] be somewhat maze-like with, you know, dead ends causing [you to] backtrack. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Generally, you'll need [to collect] the glowing book to open the exit door. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is done by jumping on those breakable tiles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, ya may find various, uh, [items and] power-ups [and] jumping on other breakable tiles. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 There will occasionally be the, uh, heart shaped, uh, refill [for your] health. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The iconography of, uh, video games is starting to be {a} [*bit*] more consistent with hearts usually indicating health, for example, (unlike [in] "Castlevania"). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [There are] some curveballs [thrown in] the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This level, for example, has no enemies, but does have a very strict time limit. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 The screen is gradually disappearing, and you'll need to act to the book A.S.A.P.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} might take a few tries [because it] seems like even a single extra jump [will] prevent you from reaching the book in time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Kind of a tough little level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Trying to [activate] the book now. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] in fact, as you'll see, I'm a little bit too late; {I} can't get to it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Overall, uh, "...Dababa" is an intriguing game and actually quite addictive. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was obviously never released in the U.S. and seems like a minor Konami title even in Japan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing [that] *is* a [little bit different from] {the} [rest] {of} the game are the *boss* battles. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 They're done in the side perspective and it actually remind you a lot of the bosses [in] "Castlevania". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the first one, [right] here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This guy is, uh, certainly tougher [than] the [first] "Castlevania" boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He can grab you with his tongue [and] chew you up [and spit you out]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He moves, uh,[pretty] fast. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I think the fact that your character can [only] jump (not move, uh, [and] just walk normally) makes this harder than it would be otherwise. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 [And] the controls [can] be a [little] tricky [at] times; it's kinda fought the fire straight up. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 You have been not moving at all (completely stationary) in order to do that. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Whatever that is, it makes you a little guy seem quite pleased. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, aesthetically, uh, "...Dababa" is a [pretty] pleasing game (nice colors and designs, rather cool music). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While I wouldn't really brand this a classic, uh, it's certainly worth your while to check out. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Smash Ping Pong 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 May 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Did you catch the release details on this game a second ago? 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 If not, check it out here in the title screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yep! [Developed] by [Konami and published] by Nintendo. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 What's that about? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], by the way, we don't really get to see the little F.D.S. mascot guy in games very often. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But there he is. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, what's the story on this? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, this a port of Konami's 1985 Arcade Game "[Konami's] Ping Pong", obviously renamed for the F.D.S. release. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the Arcade version here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} features the Konami penguin instead of the F.D.S. dude in the title screen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, Ping Pong holds a special place [in] video game history. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Think of "Pong" (the first commercially successful Arcade video game). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There weren't many realistic Ping Pong games around, which is exactly what "[Konami's] Ping Pong" is (right down to the creepy looking, floating, disembodied hands). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This F.D.S. version here is a very accurate port. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It looks almost exactly the same. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You could almost overlay screenshots on top of each other and they'd match up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, in "Smash Ping Pong", the table has no legs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the penguin in the audience has been replaced by Donkey Kong (you can see him there on the right side). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the controls seem a little off in the F.D.S. version as compared to the original, but they are very similar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Smash Ping Pong" is just 100% pure Ping Pong and nothing else. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The control scheme is a little odd. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Use the Left or Right on the D-Pad [to] swing rather than the buttons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The buttons are used to serve the ball and to reverse the direction [of] the paddle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, I'm terrible at this game, and was never really able [to] master the controls (kind of like Nintendo's "Volleyball", I guess). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I don't know [that] this game made a huge splash. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was never released in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And I don't know how Nintendo ended up [licensing the] game from Konami. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I don't think Nintendo ever published another Konami game in Japan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I can [only] assume Nintendo was running short on finished games and needed something to fill out their release schedule. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Or maybe the problem was Nintendo was busy [developing] a game for an outside publisher. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You can see what I'm talking about in a couple episodes down the line. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Remember, of course, Nintendo [did] not have a huge stable of second-party developers like they do now. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, if ya like Ping Pong, I guess give this a try. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Deep Dungeon II: Yuushi no Monshou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 May 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HummingBirdSoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by DOG 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is actually some [pretty] cool music coming up here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And a [pretty] stylish logo. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I sense a crossed swords theme (read into that what you will). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, this is "Deep Dungeon II..." from HummingBirdSoft on the D.O.G. label. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We covered the first "Deep Dungeon..." game back in "Chrontendo ... 13". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The screen where ya save your game however is [pretty] basic looking. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, note that "Deep Dungeon" is a hardcore dungeon crawl game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This screen is the entire outside world - the shop, the inn, the castle, whatever, it's all right here. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 "Deep Dungeon" is so not interested in anything that is not a dungeon that they don't even bother coming up with a graph [for] the entire non-dungeon world. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a first-person R.P.G. of the sort that was becoming quite old-[fashioned in] 1987. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's really just a prettied up [variation] on "Wizardry". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [you] buy your weapons and your supplies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Don't forget to equip it and then wander around the dungeon killing beasts. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This dungeon uses ladders rather than stairways. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And this looks almost identical to the first "Deep Dungeon..." game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (I guess the monsters kind of look a [little bit better]; we'll [probably] see one [in just] a [moment] here.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um...[Only] a few tweaks have been made. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You still slam [into] doors if you don't open [them]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {I} [actually] forgot to equip my axe there ({a} good way [to get] yourself killed easily [right] off the bat). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, there we go. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And enemy [fighting] is [pretty] much [just] sorta, you know, 'hit your attack button'; you can also run but, uh, really not exactly a whole lot of, uh, strategy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh! And, of course, you [can] still run into the unexpectedly tough enemy that will kill you instantly (like just happened here). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a rather hateful feature of these early R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, [most] {of} [the] enemies on this level are a piece [of] cake can be -- can be killed in one blow if you have a decent weapon. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 They're sort of all the typical skeletons, and insects, and, uh, [these] things look like giant flies. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once ya [get] enough Experience Points you'll Level Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, something that's interesting is that "Deep Dungeon II..." gives you Skill Points [to] distribute. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([Just] added some [to], like, your various, uh, stats there.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But [there's not] really, like, a whole [lot] of [kind] of like, uh, ya know, character building in "Deep Dungeon {II}...". 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 One nice change is that, uh, the first game, you would [find] Gold by looking through piles of trash ([which is not] a very dignified way [to] make money). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The sequel has you, uh, opening up honest-to-God [treasure] chests as per standard video game rules. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 The chests [are often] found in groups, uh, that we only saw a second ago it's just, ya know, chock full of them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another change: rather than being an eight level dungeon, we have a four level dungeon and a four level tower. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([I'm] actually in the tower [right] here; [that's] the, uh, easier part.) 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Another, uh, thing with the same: it's still hella hard [to find your] way around. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 (A in-game map? Forget about it). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And these dungeons really have no distinguishing landmarks - [just] a collection of, uh, doors [and] halls. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This must [have] been developed [quite] quickly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The first] game came [out in] December of [1986] (five [months before] this one). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, [I'm] in the actual dungeon - though [the] monsters here [are] too powerful for me [at] my level. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Ya [know], fans have a modern style (or even in 1987-era) R.P.G.s [will probably] find [little] to enjoy here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is all [about] exploring dungeons [and] killing monsters with very [little] else. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Reflect World 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by East Cube 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by East Cube 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We enter the month of June with "...Episode 18"'s 'What the fuck?' game? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Every [episode] has [to] have one. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 This time around it's "Reflect World" from otherwise unknown company called East Cube. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Who are these guys? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But this is their [only] FamiCom game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 That's probably a good thing since "Reflect World" rivals "...Super Monkey Daibōken" in being seemingly [pointless]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm sure there is something to do in this game, but from my experience playing it, I certainly couldn't figure out what it was. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Reflect World"'s booklet supposedly details some sort of elaborate plot behind the game but there doesn't seem to be any hint of this in the game itself (no opening cutscenes, no dialogue, nothing of the sort). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 What little text there is, is actually all in English. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You play as this armored tank and drive around this maze-like surface of the planet, which has the same rust coloration as used for the ground in so many Nintendo games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {You} come [across] a variety of [sort] of random looking enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When ya [shoot] them ya [get] money. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 (Killing [for] money, too common theme [in] these video games all thanks [to] "Dungeons & Dragons", I guess.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Your tank is unusually customizable, [and] there's [different sorts] of weapons you [can] equip, [and] you [can] increase the fuel tank capacity [and] so on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 All of this [sounds] cool in theory, [but] the application is [not] very impressive. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 After driving [around for] a while, eventually you will find these, sort of, caverns [that can transport] -- [you] {to} [different] parts {of} the world. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But these other areas seem just as uninteresting as where ya start out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 By the way, [combat] is a little difficult in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] take a [lot of] damage, [but you] will end up [getting hit] by enemy fire a lot. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 You're [pretty] slow [and] bulky, so you're aren't really able [to] dodge enemy projectiles, especially when dealing with larger foes like this one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They [shoot out] a whole [lot] of bullets. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Doesn't make sense; I mean you are a tank after all. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 There is a small underground area. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this takes you [out] to another area. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] again, [it] doesn't really seem [to] really go anywhere. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] an odd section. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In [order to] move around this heavily forested area, ya need [to utilize your] secondary weapon, which [doesn't] harm enemies but destroys trees. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll need [to] cause some major ecological damage [in] order [to] explore this area. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 [Not that] there's any good reason to - this area seems, uh, just empty as the others. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] you will occasionally find a shop, however. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess the guys running the store [are] so mercenary [that] they'll sell weapons [to] the guys who are destroying the planet. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 This is one [of] the games {with} several R.P.G. elements. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But what] seems {to} be missing is anything interesting actually happening. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This [part] here seems unusually baffling. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 [You, sort] of, go [around] these various, [sort] of, quarters. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 There's all these little, uh, [portals], but [when] you enter one, you usually [pretty] much end up [in] the same area. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Nothing ever really seems to [kind] of go anywhere. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 You [just, sort] of, ride [around in] circles and, uh, going through those little caverns and, uh, looking -- going through various halls [and] corridors [and] whatnot. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 [That's actually] sorta true the entire game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The [world design is, pretty] undistinguished. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Each area wraps around eventually, [but] since everywhere looks the same, it's really hard {to} tell if you're going anywhere [or just] moving in circles. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] some reason, that little base thing, uh, you [can] drive over [but] nothing really happens. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, I know there's more [to] "Reflect World" [than just] this, [but] I certainly [couldn't] find [out what it] was. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Too bad because "Reflect World" (I mean, it) looks like kind of a cool game - ya get [to] ride [around with] the tank [and] ya know, blast off. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This [might] remind ya a [little bit] of "Blaster Master", [except] maybe, [sort] of, a really stupid version of "Blaster Master". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, either way, give this game a try [and] see [if] you [can get] further than I did. 🍇🍌

✅🍪🍊🍓 They say that in every life a little rain [must] fall. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Likewise, if you were dedicated [to] playing every FamiCom game, you are going [to] have to eventually play S.N.K.'s "Athena". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} has a reputation as one of the worst [titles released for] the Nintendo in [the] United States. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But is [it] really [that] bad? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, the lack of effort, uh, [put into] this shows immediately with the lack of music on the [title] screen and the nonsensical opening sequence. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 From the [get]-go, "Athena" looks surprisingly amateurish. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Athena" is a port of these Arcade titles ([not] released [in] the U.S.) [from 1986]. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade version [at] least has an opening that make sense. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Athena jumps [from that] door, her dress comes off, and she lands bikini-clad [into] the world below. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Athena" was clearly [part of] the trend of adding R.P.G. elements in video games. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 [Note] the bars on the right-hand side showing attack [and] defense stats. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's not] a bad-looking game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] if you [only] played the home version, you'll finally be able [to] make sense [out of] the weapons Athena picks up (which [are] much better drawn [in] this original version). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, part of "Athena"'s claim to fame in Japan was the sex appeal. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And that] is [pretty] obvious when you take [into consideration] the opening sequence or when ya look [at] the Arcade flyer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For the FamiCom release, this image was used on the box [art as] well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo [of] America [didn't] really approve of using sex [to] sell video games so in the [United] States, we got some [sort] of standard [fantasy] type art. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As we [can] see, "Athena" is a side-scrolling Action Game with a [bit] of jumping [and] climbing here [and] there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's lots [of] weapons [to] pick up including [what] is [supposed to] be a hammer, [but looks kinda like] a [giant pipe] here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [There's] also a variety of armor in many [different] colors. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 However, because the attack [and] defense bars [have] been dropped, [it's not] really clear how powerful any [of] the items actually are. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 As is evident from this video, a female looks a mess - ugly graphics [with] tons of flicker, uh, rendering the action [almost] incomprehensible [at] times. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Factor in the bad controls and the less-than-stellar level design, and you'll see why it has such a bad reputation. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But wait! There's more! 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 [You're] always having to, uh, [break] blocks [to find] hidden [items] or work in a progress. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, [only] certain weapons [can] do this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The ball [and] chain ([or] Morningstar or whatever the heck [that] is supposed [to] be) is a [great] weapon [but it's impossible to] hang on to. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Enemies frequently drop weak weapons (such [as] the sword or the bow [and] arrow) which I now have here [and] they're [pretty] much useless. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Touching one [will automatically] exchange [it] for [your current] weapon. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 So, if you've a good weapon, you'll be trying to avoid enemies entirely so [that] you accidentally [don't get] a weapons downgrade. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Bad weapons are also frequently found hidden in blocks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's how I [got] the bow [and] arrow. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the [first] boss, a killer tree. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Get this; it [can] be killed with one shot [if] ya [get past] the fireballs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] disappointing boss there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Even the level transitions in "Athena" are awful. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You suddenly get a black screen [and] boom, [you're in] the next level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's the} same [with] the deaths: the screen goes black the split second you touch [an] enemy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now while the Arcade Game had problems, a [lot of] the blame [can] be placed on Micronics, who [developed this] port. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Micronics is the notorious contractor/developer who are also responsible [for] the early Capcom ports [and] the ports of "Ikari Warriors". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [question] is, 'Why did reputable companies like Capcom [and] S.N.K. use Micronics to do their console ports?'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 How [do] these guys keep jetting -- getting jobs? 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 And just how cheaply did Micronics work? 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Were Capcom [and] S.N.K. such arcades snobs they [just didn't] care [about console ports]? 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Kind of odd but S.N.K., a company known for releasing the absurdly expensive Neo Geo console (which allowed for Arcade-perfect home versions) would be [satisfied] with home ports like this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess the Arcade version of "Athena" was a decent [little title, but] this [port] is so flawed [it] makes it, uh, [pretty] unbearable. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, "Athena" is [only] bad compared [to] the work of other major publishers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you compare [it to] something like "Lost Word of JeNny", I mean, [it's] actually a [lot better than] that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's [not exactly great, but not] really [as] bad as ya [might] think. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Takahashi Meijin no Bugutte Honey 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 05 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 [Just] like "Athena", the very simple [title] screen [with] no music marks this is a quickie title. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it's called "Takahashi [Meijin] no [Bugutte] Honey". 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 So, [you start] the game [and] ya [must] be thinking it's [an] "Adventure Island" spin-off, but, uh, it's [sort] of is ([and] I'll go [into that in just] a minute). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You're actually playing [not as] Takahashi [himself but] as the titular Honey, who is this, uh, freaky looking bee girl. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} resembles a [Shooter or] a Platformer, [but your] real [goal is to find] the invisible eggs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then the gum -- game becomes an "Arkanoid" clone ([and] a double screen "Arkanoid" clone, [at] that). 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 While breaking blocks occasionally, uh, [will] cause the letter [to] fall out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes catching the [letter] is good, and sometimes [it'll] blow up your ship. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, there [are] various sorts of, uh, power-ups [to] collect as well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, the [lightning bolt] there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Oops! I collected a bad [letter].) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's also, of course, you have the longer ship and, uh, so on, [and] so forth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And in some -- in some levels [little] aliens [will] come [out and] fly around [and that sort] of thing. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 You [managed] to clear [out] all the blocks that losing [your] ships, you will [escape] the "Arkanoid" level [and] you'll see which of the collect letters you've collected. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, ya need [to] collect all the, uh, [letters] listed there to fill out the password [to] move on [to the next] level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, now [you're] back [to] the side-scrolling stage where ya need [to find] another hidden egg [and] then it's "Arkanoid" again to [collect another letter]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you [just, sort] of, go around [and around] I guess, or say there's around, uh, eight "Arkanoid" levels per larger level. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here I've got, uh, another [kinda] cool power-up there - at least temporarily. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Um... {You} [can sort] of jump these waves it'll keep the ball bouncing around. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 I guess these "Arkanoid" sections aren't really bad, but then they're [pretty] basic - nothing on level of Konami's "Nazo no Kabe...", for example. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, if you're wondering, what does it have anything to do with "Adventure Island"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's actually based on an animated series Hudson put out in the mid-1980s, featuring Takahashi and Honey. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's some promotional material for the game that shows the animated series characters (as well as a rather unnecessary up the skirt shot of Toshi Yuki Takahashi himself). 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 While I guess there's really nothing wrong with the idea of this game, in theory is "...Bugutte Honey" is really not very playable. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 The science rolling sections are really short (much shorter than typical level like a Platform game) and not well done at all. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The "Arkanoid" stages are [pretty] repetitive [and] the whole business of trying to get the right letters is kinda tedious. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I never finished the first level. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 But ya do play as Takahashi in some late levels, so maybe it gets a little bit better? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As it stands, I'd say this title is [pretty] disappointing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Oh, by the way, occasionally ya get this rather unpleasant hell level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 All the blocks are unbreakable and {it} takes forever to escape. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Um... Not mery -- very much fun, but I guess it -- it's almost kind of like, uh, the rest [of] the game [quite] frankly. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 12 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sunsoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, check this out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Whoo Sunsoft! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's [about] the [coolest] thing in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yep! It is the second "Nazoler [Land]" magazine game from Sunsoft [and] the Japanese publishing company, Sekaibunka-sha. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [first] game came [out] back [in] February, as ya may recall [from] a few episodes ago. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, also cool [is] the loading screen [and] the menu screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 See, it's, sort of, like having six [separate] FamiCom games. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 [If] only had they put this much [effort into] the actual games themselves. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, this issue starts off with the game, which I assume is m... -- int... -- meant [to] be called "Patrick". 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 [But], unfortunately, is rendered as 'Patalick' on [title] screen. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 [It's] a rather simple Puzzle Game where ya try {to} [get] all the squares in one color by flipping them one row or column at a time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm sure you've seen a variation on this game somewhere before. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He somehow changes from angel [to] devil I guess depending on the color that he's standing on. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Next up is a Quiz Game (a genre [that] would become [quite popular in] Japan). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Is this the, uh, first Quiz Game [we've] seen for a console system? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess that is, sort of, interesting. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Quiz Games would eventually (along with Mahjong Games and Dating Sims) make about 75% of the Japanese catalog [for] the Sega Saturn. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] various sorts of weird little minigames throughout this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... I like that weird, [sort] of, uh, glam death rocker lookin' dude. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Is] he actually giving you the finger? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now beyond "Patalick", I [suppose] the other, [sort] of, playable game on this is this one [right] here where [you're] this school girl character [that] uses [little] bombs to make her way down this level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, her, uh, [skirt] flies up whenever she drops down one level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Bombs look kinda like the bases from, uh, "[Fantasy] Zone", [for] some reason. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is [not particularly] well-designed, [but it] is reasonably distracting, I guess. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Because you're a girl, if you touch a rat, ya die. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 And because [this is] one [of] those magazine-style games, there's also the letters section (where, uh, where you simply read [letters - not] very [interesting]). 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 One thing [that's] a [little] strange is Sunsoft eventually had a [reputation for some] good games, but, uh, back then, they were [just] utter s--- merchants - realising crap like this or "Super Boy Allen..." or whatnot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, far, they do have one [of] the very worst track records of any FamiCom publisher. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hercules no Eikou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 12 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Originality is [not] a virtue we find in every game, especially this episode. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Seiken Psycho Calibur..." [is] the [first] game we've seen to openly [and] shamelessly ape "...Zelda", "...Hercules no Eikou" copies another [popular] FamiCom [title]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This does have a [pretty decent] musical theme however. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "...Hercules no Eikou" (or 'the Glory of Hercules') was [published] by [Data] East. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though it's [not] really clear who [developed the game]. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 [Data] East [only recently started] releasing regional [titles for] the FamiCom. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Prior [to] this in the "Tantei Jingūji Saburō" game, they start mostly [to ports of] older Arcade Games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It just] goes [to] show how much the FamiCom is changing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... We're seeing episodes [with only] a couple [ported titles and] the rest all being original games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 At any [rate], you may have figured [out that] "...Hercules no Eikou" bears more [than] a passing resemblance [to] 'Dragon Quest', [right] down [to] the style of character sprites, the menus, the world layout, [and] the general gameplay. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya talk [to] the townspeople, enter the shops, buy equipment, [and] then [set out in] the world [to] fight random monster battles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One nice thing [about] the shops is, uh, they [actually have] a [little, sort] of, portrait of the shopkeeper or the innkeeper (something we [didn't] see in 'Dragon [Quest', for] example). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though the guys all [kind] of look alike [and for] some reason they're all, [sort] of, posed with one hand sticking [out] towards you. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Now, one sorta cool thing [about] "...Hercules..." is [that your] character actually changes the appearance, um, based on the armor [that] he's equipped. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As we [can] see here, [I've] also [got] a [little] shield. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 W... -- [Another interesting] difference is the town [and] the [overworld are] on the same screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That is, the, uh, town and [your] character are life sized on the [overworld] map. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 In "Dragon Quest" the [overworld] maps were a [bit] more symbolically, uh, represented was sort of a, uh, [giant-size] character wandering over a map, representing [kind of your] travels all over the world. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "...Hercules..." is more [in] line [with] games like "Hydlide...", uh, with the way the [overworld] is presented. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 The [combat] is essentially same; even enemies take turns smacking each other. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing [about] this game is you will occasionally run [into] these, [sort] of, overly-powerful enemies [that] *quickly* kill you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... The early Japanese Role Playing Games seemed [quite] fond of that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... They [didn't] mollycoddle you like these games nowadays. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 The very first enemies you encounter, I guess, are the equivalent of the, uh, "Dragon [Quest]" Slimes. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 It looks sorta like the facehuggers [from] the 'Aliens' movies (as we [can] see here). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another rather [unusual] feature: your equipment, uh, takes damage with use. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya see the numbers drop often when [ya] use your sword - or you [actually] take a blow, then, like, the armor numbers [will] drop. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is [not] very common in Japanese *Role* Playing Games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Rather, it's something [that] we, uh, tend [to] see more [in] Western R.P.G. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Something we s... -- actually see a [lot] of nowadays, [for] example (take the new, uh, 'Fallout' game, for example). 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 I guess (depending on [your] feelings) it's a [bit] of added realism in the depth, or maybe it's just an extra annoyance. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, while this is clearly a "Dragon Quest" clone (in fact, it's the first honest-to-God exact "Dragon Quest" clone we've *seen*) um, it's *certainly* [not] the *last*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... [And] ya [might] be wondering, 'Is it any good?'. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's hard [to] say; I [didn't] really play [it] very much. 🍇

🟨🍪🍊🍓 The first "Dragon Quest" wasn't exactly an enthralling *game* [but at] least [it] offered something *new*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's certainly not the case *here*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] this game [doesn't] *seem* [to] be *too well remembered* there *were* some rather, uh, better known sequels [for] the FamiCom [and] Super FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *rather surprisingly* a new *entry* in the series, "Hercules no Eikou: Tamashii no Shōmei" was released for the D.S. [in 2008]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Here we are going into the inn to, uh, *heal up*; that'll restore your H.P. [but] won't actually, uh, restore [your] armor and weapons. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], you [can't get] very far [without] passing by the [first] boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Even [at] Level 4 I [got] killed rather easily so [it] seems [this] game is a [little bit] on the, uh, grinding-*intensive* side. 🍇🍌


🟨🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess [it's sort] of cool [to] see [Data] East take a bold step [in] releasing this game, uh, [it's] *really* [not] that interesting of a [title]. 🍇🍌
