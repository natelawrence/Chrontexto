👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 4 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 In this episode, 🍋 we'll be covering 🍊 15 games released between 🍋 June and August of 1985. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There will be a number of 🍋 unfamiliar titles this week. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of this week's releases 🍋 are Japanese-[only] titles, 🍊 and, uh, they're 🍋 mostly Arcade ports. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Remember, of course, 🍋 that, at this point, 🍊 the vast majority of the 🍋 non-Nintendo released games 🍋 for the FamiCom were ports, 🍊 either of Arcade games or 🍋 of Japanese Computer Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, we will be seeing 🍋 two games that appear 🍋 to be FamiCom originals 🍊 ("Honshougi..." and "Geimos"). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll also see the Japanese 🍋 debut of one of Nintendo's 🍊 more infamous accessories, 🍋 the Robotic Operating Buddy. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hyper Olympic 🇯🇵 // Track & Field 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 June 21 🇯🇵 // 1987 April [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Welcome to the first 🍋 game of this episode; 🍊 it's "Hyper Olympic" 🍋 by Konami. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a port of the 🍋 1983 Arcade Game, 🍊 which you might know 🍋 as "Track & Field". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing that's a little unusual 🍊 is that this game apparently 🍋 uses licensed music. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you notice, 🍋 the, uh, music playing here 🍊 is the famous "Olympic Theme" 🍋 by John Williams. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I assume that Nin..., uh, 🍋 Konami had to pay to 🍋 use that in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, unlike "Yie Ar Kung-Fu" 🍋 or "Antarctic Adventure", 🍊 this game was well-known 🍋 in both the U.S. and Japan 🍊 and was a [pretty] 🍋 substantial Arcade hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So I think getting this 🍋 title on the FamiCom 🍊 was probably a bit more 🍋 prestigious for Nintendo 🍊 than those first 🍋 two Konami titles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you played 🍋 this game in the arcades, 🍊 you'll probably remember 🍋 this being the game that 🍊 you, sort of, had to 🍋 pound on the buttons 🍋 with your hands furiously, 🍊 in order to get your 🍋 players to run fast. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I imagine this caused quite a 🍋 bit of stress on the machines 🍊 and, as I recall, 🍋 one of the, uh, machines 🍋 in a local arcade 🍊 had installed, sort of, 🍋 little rings around the buttons, 🍊 so you couldn't actually 🍋 pound on them quite so hard. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, this made the actual 🍋 game more difficult to play. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for the FamiCom version 🍋 (because there's [only] two 🍋 buttons on the controller) 🍊 you [only] actually use 🍋 one button to run. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] second button's used for 🍋 jumping and that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the FamiCom port looks [pretty] 🍋 similar to the Arcade version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The graphics aren't quite as good, 🍊 however there is a [pretty] 🍋 substantial difference 🍊 in that the original Arcade 🍋 version had six, uh, games, 🍊 whereas the FamiCom 🍋 release [only] has four. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Those would be 🍋 the 100 Meter Dash, the Hurdles, 🍋 the Long Jump, and the Javelin. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The running games on this 🍋 involved mostly just, sort of, 🍊 hitting the button to get 🍋 your player to run really fast. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The other games 🍋 (such as the, uh, 🍋 Javelin or Long Jump) 🍊 involve running and then jumping 🍋 and holding down your D-Pad 🍊 until your player 🍋 reaches a certain angle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Much of the challenge of 🍋 the game, for these events, 🍊 is, sort of, getting your 🍋 player at the right angle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then occasionally, there is 🍋 the little, uh, interludes, here; 🍊 the players just, sort of, run 🍋 around to the "Olympic Theme". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You don't actually do anything 🍋 yourself during these; 🍊 they're just, like, 🍋 little cutscenes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are these weird little 🍋 hidden bonuses throughout the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, on the 100 Meter Dash 🍋 if you finish with the exact 🍋 same time as your opponent, 🍊 this little teddy bear thing appears 🍋 and you get a bunch of bonus points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each of the events have 🍋 their own little hidden bonus. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for the 🍋 American release, 🍊 this was released under 🍋 the name "Track & Field". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And "Track & Field" actually has 🍋 eight events - not just four. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What actually happened is: 🍋 this game was not released 🍋 in the U.S. until 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At that point, there'd already 🍋 been a sequel in Japan, 🍋 called "Hyper Sports", 🍊 so they actually took both 🍋 "Hyper Olympic" and "Hyper Sports" 🍊 [and] combined into one game, 🍋 "Track & Field". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the U.S. version has the 🍋 extra four sports which are, 🍊 uh, Skeet Shooting, 🍋 uh, Pole Vaulting, 🍋 Triple Jump, and Archery. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The American version's 🍋 actually a bit easier 🍋 than the Japanese version 🍊 because you can actually select 🍋 which sport you wanna play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the Japanese "Hyper Olympic", 🍋 you actually [have] to 🍋 qualify for an event 🍊 before you can move on 🍋 to the next one. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Star Force 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 June 25 🇯🇵 // 1987 November [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // Tecmo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And here we have "Star Force". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a port of 🍋 Tehkan's 1985 Arcade Game 🍊 (also known as "Mega Force"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, this game 🍋 is a Vertical Shooter. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Star Force" was actually 🍋 developed by Tehkan themselves 🍊 (a company that would later 🍋 change its name to [Tecmo]). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game was actually published 🍋 by Hudson Soft, however. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll take a look at the 🍋 original Arcade version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, the FamiCom 🍋 actually does a [pretty] good job 🍋 of replicating the Arcade graphics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game also plays and feels 🍋 quite a bit like 🍋 the Arcade version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll go back, now, 🍋 to the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At the time this 🍋 game was released, 🍊 [Tecmo] was not yet 🍋 a FamiCom licensee, 🍊 so they couldn't release 🍋 this game themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, apparently, they 🍋 actually went with Hudson Soft 🍋 to actually release this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [Tecmo] is one of those 🍋 companies that's been around, 🍋 in some capacity, for quite a while 🍊 but didn't actually start 🍋 developing video games 🍋 until around 1981. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, they're 🍋 still around today; 🍊 they're behind such games as 🍋 "Ninja Gaiden" and the 🍋 'Dead or Alive' series. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Star Force" falls 🍋 very much into the school of 🍋 post-"Xevious" Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is [pretty] simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You really [only] have one weapon 🍋 (some sort of laser cannon) 🍊 not too much along [the] way 🍋 of, uh, power-ups here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There actually is a way you can 🍋 make your ship, uh, more powerful. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll actually see that right here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But there really aren't 🍋 any of those, uh, 🍊 special weapons power-ups 🍋 like you would normally expect 🍋 to have of later Shooters 🍊 (no Mega Bombs or 🍋 anything like that). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Back in 1984, 🍋 Shooters didn't really have 🍋 much of those kind of things. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, there is something sort 🍋 of like an end-of-the-level boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At the end of each level, you 🍋 actually have to destroy a target, 🍊 even though it's 🍋 not really difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, as far as old-school 🍋 Shoot-'em-Ups go, 🍊 yeah, I'd say "Star Force" 🍋 is a [pretty] good game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've dealt with 🍋 this boss-like creature, 🍊 you'll move on 🍋 to the next level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then it just, sort of, 🍋 repeats forever 🍊 (or so I would assume; 🍋 I never actually played the 🍋 game all the way through). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As usual, you get more difficult 🍋 enemies in later levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 these little things 🍊 shoot all kinds of 🍋 crazy bullets at you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the game controls [pretty] well, 🍋 it's reasonably fun, fast paced, 🍊 ...certainly a lot better than the 🍋 two Shooters that Jaleco released, 🍋 earlier in the year. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I've heard this game was actually 🍋 [pretty] successful in Japan - 🍊 not so much in the U.S., 🍋 even though it was actually 🍋 released in the U.S. - 🍊 a lot of the early FamiCam -- 🍋 FamiCom games weren't. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll take a look at the 🍋 U.S. version in just a second. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You know, it's interesting; 🍋 this game actually does 🍋 get relatively hectic 🍊 for a Shooter of 🍋 this early vintage - 🍊 much more so than, 🍋 say, "Xevious". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Xevious" was 🍋 much more sedate. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, this game is not 🍋 actually as good as "Xevious", 🍊 but it... does play 🍋 quite a bit different. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll look at the 🍋 American version, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The graphics actually are a little 🍋 different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... [A] few things have 🍋 changed, apparently - 🍋 nothing too major, however. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, I guess we'll say, as far 🍋 as old-school Shoot-'em-Ups go, 🍊 "Star Force" is actually 🍋 a [pretty] decent game! 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Elevator Action 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 June 28 🇯🇵 // 1987 August [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next up, we have 🍋 "Elevator Action", 🍊 a port of Taito's 🍋 1983 Arcade Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike a lot of these 🍋 early Taito ports, 🍊 this one was released in 🍋 the U.S.A, as well Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can hear, 🍋 this game contains a great 🍋 old-school-style soundtrack. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [There's] not too much 🍋 of a plot, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Basically, you play this sort of 🍋 red-headed pompadoured super spy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your job is to steal some plans, 🍊 and then get to the 🍋 bottom of the hotel, 🍋 and escape. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Along the way, 🍋 you'll face countless 🍊 Boris Badenov style 🍋 foreign agents 🍊 which you're permitted 🍋 to shoot, on sight. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can also shut [off] the 🍋 lights to make the room darker, 🍊 making it a little bit 🍋 harder for you to get hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] plans are actually 🍋 found behind those red doors; 🍊 you'll wannna collect all those, 🍋 in order to get a good score. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Notice the floors are numbered. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This, sort of, gives you 🍋 a general idea about 🍊 how far along you're 🍋 getting towards the bottom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this game came along 🍋 at a time when video games 🍋 were, sort of, getting away 🍊 from the single-screen 🍋 kind of game 🍊 (you know, games such as, 🍋 uh, "Pac-Man", for example). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Scrolling was becoming 🍋 a lot more common. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I think the idea behind 🍋 games like "Elevator Action" 🍊 is that the game takes place 🍋 in a larger world - 🍊 beyond what you can just see 🍋 on a single screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can [only] see a bit 🍋 of this world at a time, 🍊 however, the more of the game 🍋 you com... -- you complete, 🍋 the more you'll encounter. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Nowadays, of course, 🍋 this idea is very common. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, back in the early '80s, 🍋 scrolling was still 🍋 relatively new, 🍊 so it made games like 🍋 "Elevator Action", 🍊 seem sort of 🍋 interesting and different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Elevator Action" [was] 🍋 one of those early games 🍊 that, sort of, drew you 🍋 into a larger world. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The fact that the action 🍋 was so simple and repetitive 🍊 really made it all 🍋 that more appealing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even though the rules were simple, 🍋 there were still a number of things 🍋 that could happen in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as I mentioned, 🍊 once you get to the bottom 🍋 (to the, uh, basement, actually) 🍊 you jump in your little 🍋 sports car, zoom away, 🍊 and then the game begins again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, the next building 🍋 is a little bit different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And that's "Elevator Action" 🍋 in a nutshell. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, since "Elevator Action" 🍋 came out in 1983 in the arcades, 🍊 the graphics are [pretty] simple, 🍋 so the FamiCom was able to 🍊 [pretty] much accurately represent 🍋 the graphics in this game. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Field Combat 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 July 09 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Jaleco | Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next up, we have 🍋 "Field Combat" by Jaleco. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a port of 🍋 Jaleco's 1985 Arcade Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, oddly, this FamiCom version 🍋 actually looks an awful lot like 🍋 the original Arcade release. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There hasn't really been much 🍋 of a graphical downgrade 🍋 from the Arcade version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a little strange; 🍊 I mean, the Arcade version 🍋 looks like it came out more, 🍋 like, in 1982, rather than 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you think about it, 🍊 1985 was the year that games like 🍋 "Ghosts 'n Goblins" were coming out 🍊 (which, you know, looked about 10 🍋 times better than games like this). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this game might be 🍋 described as a Vertical Shooter, 🍋 but it's not really. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually more of a 🍋 "Commando" type game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no forced scrolling, 🍋 the enemies don't just whiz by 🍋 if you don't shoot them, 🍊 and everything's at a much 🍋 slower pace than most Shooters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Something that's a 🍋 bizarre little coincidence 🍊 is the prototype for 🍋 all these kind of games 🍋 (which was called "Front Line") 🍊 will actually be 🍋 released for the FamiCom 🍋 very shortly after this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there are several ways 🍋 that "Field Combat" differs 🍊 from your typical, uh, 🍋 Run-'n'-Gun type game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One of them: 🍋 Levels are actually quite short; 🍊 [it] has a number of, 🍋 uh, shorter levels, 🍊 rather than, like, 🍋 several larger levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is to get 🍋 to the very top, 🍊 knock out the big guns guarding it, 🍋 and then go through the gate. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've done that, 🍋 you'll go on to the next level 🍊 - or the next 'pattern' 🍋 (as this game calls them, 🍋 for some reason). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the really novel thing 🍋 about "Field Combat" is 🍊 they've taken a 🍋 concept from "Galaga" 🍊 and [pretty] much 🍋 turned it on its head. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Rather than your enemies having 🍋 a tractor beam they can use 🍋 to suck up your ship, 🍊 you are equipped, yourself, 🍋 with a tractor beam that you 🍋 can use to suck up enemy units! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you look on the 🍋 lower right hand corner, 🍊 you'll see that it actually 🍋 shows you which units 🍋 you have in reserve. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These are enemies that you've -- 🍋 basically that you've captured. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can call as many of these 🍋 as you like into combat 🍊 by hitting both buttons at once. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you've lost all 🍋 your reserve units, 🍊 you can then, uh, get more 🍋 by using your tractor beam 🍋 to suck up the enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, occasionally a U.F.O. will 🍋 come along and, as you can see, 🍊 he will spirit away, uh, 🍋 the friendly units that you have 🍋 on the -- on the screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, these unique features 🍊 (such as the ability to 🍋 capture enemy units 🍊 and then use them 🍋 against the enemies) 🍊 is, uh, something that, sort of, 🍋 separates this from the other 🍋 games in -- in the genre. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game certainly, uh, is 🍋 actually [pretty] fun to play - 🍋 at least for a little while. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's certainly not 🍋 nearly as bad as "Front Line" 🍊 which we'll be 🍋 seeing very soon. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Road Fighter 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 July 11 🇯🇵 // 1992 June 18 🇫🇷 🇸🇪
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 // Palcom 🇫🇷 🇸🇪 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is Konami's 🍋 "Road Fighter". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is actually the first 🍋 of two top-down Racing Games 🍊 that will both be 🍋 released in July. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 About a week later, 🍋 "Zippy Race" would come out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess they weren't afraid 🍋 of flooding the market 🍋 with top-down Racing Games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for some reason, 🍋 when you start the game, 🍊 you can hold down the 🍋 acceleration button 🍋 all you want, 🍊 but your car accelerates much 🍋 slower than all the other cars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, we call this 🍋 a Racing Game 🍊 but the idea really isn't to cross 🍋 the finish line before other cars 🍊 (or even to cross the 🍋 finish line before the timer) 🍊 but rather to win, uh -- 🍋 cross the finish line 🍋 without running out of gas. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you look down towards the 🍋 right, you'll see a fuel gauge. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is, uh, constantly going down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, it, uh, lowers 🍋 even when you're not moving. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, if you crash, 🍋 you lose some fuel 🍊 and then it continues to go down 🍋 even while you're still sitting there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, I guess the fuel gauge 🍋 basically is a timer, after all. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Keep [an] eye out there 🍋 for Konami Man 🍋 flying across the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, this game was the first 🍋 appearance of Konami Man. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He, uh, flies by occasionally 🍋 at random. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You get extra points if you 🍋 manage to, uh, stay alive 🍋 while he, uh, crosses the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... It didn't happen 🍋 to me, unfortunately. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The multi-colored cars that you 🍋 see are actually fuel cars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll want to collide with those, 🍋 while avoiding all other vehicles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you finish this race, 🍋 you'll move on to the next level; 🍋 there's four levels altogether. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After the fourth level, 🍋 the game simply repeats infinitely. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing that's a little 🍋 different about this game is, 🍊 it's *not* one of those games 🍋 where if you, uh, get hit by a car, 🍊 you'll automatically explode 🍋 or run off the road. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, if you do get hit, 🍊 you can actually recover by 🍋 pressing the D-Pad in the 🍋 direction that you're swerving. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like real life, 🍋 you can turn the wheel and, 🍋 uh, recover from a swerve. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The exception are the trucks; 🍋 you'll, uh, hit -- explode 🍋 automatically if you hit those). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, on, uh, this level, 🍋 for example, 🍊 the roads are so narrow 🍋 that you really have 🍊 almost no room to recover 🍋 from, uh, being hit by a car. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's, uh, so little space 🍋 that you're almost, sort of, 🍊 knocks you directly 🍋 off the side of the road. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you hit the 🍋 side of the road, 🍊 your car will, uh, crash and 🍋 you'll, uh, lose some fuel. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll see this here 🍋 in just a second. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you get all the way 🍋 through all four levels 🍊 (as I mentioned earlier) 🍋 the game will simply repeat. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing you might be 🍋 thinking about this game is 🍊 it looks an awful lot 🍋 like "Spy Hunter". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And unfortunately, it does sort of 🍋 s... -- play like "Spy Hunter" as well, 🍊 but without the various guns, 🍋 and weapons, and power-ups, 🍋 and that sort of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, I think the first 🍋 time I played this game - 🍋 when I saw one of the trucks 🍊 I thought, 'Oh, well; I'll go ahead 🍋 and line myself up behind the truck, 🍋 and go inside, and get a power-up.'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, no; [it] 🍋 doesn't work that way; 🍊 the trucks are just, 🍋 uh, regular cars. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another obstacle are 🍋 the oil patches 🍊 that will send you, sort of, 🍋 careening off in one direction. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, yes, this is 🍋 not really a bad game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's reasonably enjoyable 🍋 for what it is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It plays kind of like 🍋 a dumbed-down version of 🍋 "Spy Hunter", unfortunately, 🍊 but, uh, it's certainly 🍋 not as bad as "Zippy Race", 🍊 which we'll be seeing 🍋 in a few moments here. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Warpman 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 July 12 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is Taito's "Warpman" - 🍋 a port of their 1981 Arcade Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Originally, this game was known 🍋 under the titles "Warp & Warp", 🍋 and just plain "Warp Warp". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why the name change? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, we'll discuss that 🍋 in just a moment. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you take a look at 🍋 the original Arcade Game, 🍋 you might think, 🍊 'Hey! This looks an awful lot like 🍋 a goofier version of "Berserk".'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, basically it is but 🍋 there is a difference, however. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game starts off with you just 🍋 running around, shooting guys. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, if you enter the 🍋 Warp Zone in the middle 🍊 (while it's flashing), 🍋 you will suddenly enter 🍋 the second screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the second screen, 🍋 you run around 🍊 blowing up guys 🍋 with little bombs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, hey! That's an awful lot 🍋 like "Bomberman", isn't it? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's quite possible that 🍋 "Bomberman" was based on "Warp Warp"... 🍊 or it could just be a coincidence. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this version of 🍋 the game for the FamiCom, 🍊 "Warpman", has been graphically 🍋 retooled, as you can see. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The basic gameplay 🍋 is still the same; 🍊 you start off running 🍋 around, shooting guys. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When the galaxy starts flashing, 🍋 you enter into it, 🍋 go into the second zone, 🍊 and then you run 🍋 around planting bombs. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You can actually see the galaxy 🍋 flashing here, now. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, you [only] have a few seconds 🍋 to step into it before it stops. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a few other changes that 🍋 have been made to this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some additional enemies 🍋 have been added. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can actually, now, 🍋 get upgrades to your weapon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a blaster you can get 🍋 that'll, uh, make your gun 🍋 more -- more dangerous - 🍊 and there's, uh, upgrades to 🍋 bombs you can get, as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Despite these minor differences, 🍋 it's primarily the same game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I don't know that anyone was 🍋 screaming for an N.E.S. port of 🍋 this particular old Arcade Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I assume that the 🍋 release for the FamiCom 🍊 had something to do with the 🍋 new popularity of "Bomberman" 🍋 on Japanese computers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Warp & Warp" actually beat, 🍋 uh, the FamiCom "Bomberman" 🍋 to the shelves by a few months. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Bomberman" would be released for 🍋 the FamiCom in the near future. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe Taito was just trying to, 🍋 sort of, re-establish their claim 🍊 to being the, uh, first ones to 🍋 create a game of this nature. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, the new title 🍋 kind of indicates, uh, 🍊 the need to compete with 🍋 "Bomberman" as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just saw the 🍋 bomb upgrade there, 🍊 but the level ended 🍋 before I could grab it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, while there's nothing 🍋 really wrong with this game, 🍊 it is, unfortunately, 🍋 sort of destined to remain 🍋 a historical curiosity, 🍊 rather than a playable game 🍋 like "Bomberman". 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Zippy Race 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 July 18 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Irem
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our next game, here, is "Zippy Race" 🍋 - a port of Irem's 1983 Arcade Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is actually the first 🍋 Irem release for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game was also known as 🍋 "MotoRace USA" or "Traverse USA". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, either of those [names] 🍋 is more appropriate, 🍊 because this game 🍋 certainly is not very 'zippy'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, this game seems less 🍋 like a c... -- cross-country race 🍊 and more like 🍋 being stuck in traffic 🍊 behind a bunch of little old ladies 🍋 on a Sunday drive. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The cars in this game are 🍋 actually [pretty] aggressive; 🍊 as you can see here, 🍋 they *really* don't wanna 🍋 let you get around 'em. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What this means is, 🍋 when you need to pass a car, 🍋 you'll have to slow down 🍊 and, sort of, very carefully 🍋 make your way around them 🍋 to avoid getting hit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, and -- on the, uh, 🍋 right hand side of the screen there, 🍋 you'll see a fuel gauge. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your fuel supply 🍋 is constantly decreasing; 🍊 but, of course, 🍋 there are occasionally, uh, 🍋 extra fuel pickups you can get. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, they're 🍋 [pretty] far and few between 🍊 and they're placed in such a way 🍋 that if you don't know where one is, 🍊 you'll probably miss it 🍋 by driving right by. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And to make matters worse, 🍋 your fuel isn't replenished 🍋 at the end of each level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All these factors 🍋 sort of conspire 🍊 to make "Zippy Race" 🍋 a less-than-fun game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing about this game 🍋 that's a little unusual is that 🍊 once you get to a certain point 🍋 near the end of the race, 🍊 the perspective will suddenly change 🍋 from an Overhead view to 🍋 a Behind The Vehicle view. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If anything, this new perspective 🍋 makes getting around vehicles 🍋 even more difficult. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, this section of 🍋 the race is [pretty] short. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You're [only] riding, uh, 🍋 for a few more minutes here 🍊 before suddenly you 🍋 reach your destination. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, we're driving 🍋 from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The next round will have you, 🍋 uh, racing towards Houston. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The objective, of course, 🍋 is to drive all the way... 🍊 through -- 🍋 across the entire country. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually a bit of a shame. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, the idea of a 🍋 cross-country race on motorcycle's 🍋 actually [pretty] interesting. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, this game is, uh -- 🍋 the whole concept is -- 🍋 sounds a bit more fun than, 🍊 uh, the other Racing Games 🍋 released on FamiCom, at this point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's really too bad this, 🍋 uh, wasn't better realized. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as I mentioned, 🍋 this is the first, uh, game 🍋 published by Irem for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They did the Arcade 🍋 version of "Kung-Fu", 🍊 but Nin... -- Nintendo actually 🍋 released that title, themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Irem' originally stood for 🍋 'International Rental 🍋 Electronic Machines'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sometime in the late '70s, 🍋 they decided to start 🍋 making Arcade Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of their early games 🍋 were, sort of, you know, 🍋 typical product of the era - 🍊 "Space Invaders" rip-offs 🍋 (that sort of thing). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably their first really good 🍋 successful game was, uh, "Kung-Fu" 🍊 (or "Spartan X" 🍋 [as] it was known in Japan). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] came out in 1984. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Irem eventually 🍋 sort of specialized in 🍋 Shooters and Beat-'em-Ups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably the, uh, most 🍋 well-known series by Irem 🍊 is 'R-Type', starting with the, 🍋 uh, 1987 Arcade Game of that name. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Irem continued to release 🍋 Arcade Games until the mid-'90s 🍊 and, of course, you know, 🍋 they also continued to make, 🍊 uh, games for home consoles, 🍋 such as the FamiCom. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Door Door 🇯🇵  ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 July 18 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Chunsoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Enix 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This rather cute little 🍋 opening scene and music, here, 🍋 belongs to "Door Door". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Door Door" is notable 🍋 for a couple reasons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, it's the first 🍋 title published by Enix. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Secondly, it was actually [an] 🍋 enormous success in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game then paved the way 🍋 to a number of later huge hits 🍋 from Enix, such as "Dragon Quest". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object of this game is 🍋 to capture all the monsters 🍋 that appear on each screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You do this by luring them 🍋 towards an open door. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If they're headed in the right 🍋 direction, they'll walk into it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can then shut it behind them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Each door has a little 🍋 black handle on it; 🍊 you can [only] open the door if 🍋 the handle is facing the right way. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, a lot of 🍋 these doors have two handles, 🍊 so you can open 🍋 them either way. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of later levels have [only] 🍋 doors with one handle on them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yes, and if you touch one of 🍋 the little bombs, you'll explode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The little pieces of candy 🍋 are good for bonus points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the monsters have to enter 🍋 the door going the right direction. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, I've opened 🍋 this door to the right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The monster has to walk 🍋 into the door to the right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If he's coming the wrong direction, 🍋 he'll just walk on past it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once the monster's inside, 🍋 you need to close the door. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The doors can [only] be opened 🍋 and closed each way once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later levels actually contain 🍋 more monsters than doors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This means you'll have to trap 🍋 several monsters at once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Otherwise, 🍋 you'll run out of open doors 🍋 before you run out of monsters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 These sort of games 🍋 (like "Flappy" or "Door Door") 🍊 really seemed to resonate with 🍋 Japanese audiences, at the time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These games were mostly 🍋 strategy-based - not skill-based. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Door Door" doesn't really 🍋 require fast reflexes, 🍊 so much as the ability to 🍋 think a level through 🍊 and be able to plan 🍋 your course of action. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not sure why these 🍋 games were so popular. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe the FamiCom was introducing 🍋 video games to an audience 🍊 [who] hadn't really 🍋 played them so much before. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After all, the FamiCom was being 🍋 marketed in Japan as a 'Family Computer' 🍊 - that is, something 🍋 for the whole family. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, how does this 🍋 game actually play? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it was certainly 🍋 a well-designed game; 🍊 that's for sure. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The levels are well thought out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The characters are 🍋 original and cute. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The protagonist has 🍋 a bit of personality to him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Notice the way he, sort of, 🍋 taps his foot impatiently 🍋 when he's not moving. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess this is the first 🍋 video game character, 🍋 you know, with 'attitude' 🍊 (sort of like Sonic 🍋 in later years). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing you might not like 🍋 about the game is the pace. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character doesn't exactly 🍋 haul ass across the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, 🍋 he moves quite slowly, 🍊 especially when going 🍋 up or down ladders. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Playing this game, 🍊 you really wish there 🍋 was some way to, sort of, 🍋 speed him up a bit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then there's the matter of 🍋 the general structure of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like a lot of games in this era, 🍊 (for example, 🍋 "Flappy" or "Wrecking Crew") 🍊 you basically have one level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you complete it, 🍋 you go on to the next level, 🍋 which is usually sort of similar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then you sort of 🍋 repeat until infinity. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game technically 🍋 has 50 levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you get to the last one, 🍋 then the whole, uh, thing 🍋 starts repeating. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The levels get 🍋 consecutively harder, 🍊 but they don't really change 🍋 that much throughout the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This may irritate modern gamers 🍊 who are used to more 🍋 variety in their games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, at the time, 🍋 it was standard, 🍊 so this really shouldn't 🍋 be held against "Door Door". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this type of game 🍊 (you know, the, uh, 🍋 'single-screen, uh, but 🍋 many different levels') 🍊 will disappear [pretty] 🍋 quickly on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By the way, this game is 🍋 not a FamiCom original. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually a port of a game 🍋 that was released slightly earlier 🍋 by Enix, for Japanese computers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I should also point out: 🍋 this game was developed 🍋 by Koichi Nakamura. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He and his Chunsoft development 🍋 team would later go on to 🍊 such games for Enix, 🍋 such as "Dragon Quest". 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Arabian 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 July 25 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sunsoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sun Electronics 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is "Super Arabian" 🍋 by Sunsoft. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the first Sunsoft 🍋 game for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is an advanced port 🍋 of an Arcade Game from 1983, 🍋 called "Arabian". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, I believe 🍋 the original Arcade Game 🍊 was actually published 🍋 by Sun Electronics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sunsoft is, like, a special, uh, 🍋 home console video game division 🍊 that had not yet 🍋 been created in 1983. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Sunsoft eventually 🍋 became known for making 🍊 some [pretty] good games 🍋 for the FamiCom 🍊 (for example, "Master Blaster"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However "Super Arabian" is 🍋 *definitely not* a good game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Quite frankly, 🍋 playing "Super Arabian" 🍊 I'm really reminded of playing, 🍋 like, an old Atari 2600 game! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The gameplay is very simple 🍋 (just sort of running and jumping). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The graphics are very bland. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's really not much to 🍋 recommend this game to anybody. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the game starts off 🍋 harmlessly enough; 🍊 the first screen is no big deal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, once you get 🍋 to the second level, 🍊 you start encountering 🍋 a few gameplay problems. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why is it so hard to jump and grab 🍋 ahold of a vine, for example? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, by the time you get to the 🍋 third screen, all bets are off. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think there are seven levels 🍋 for this game altogether, 🍊 but I have never been able 🍋 to get past the third one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If anyone out there actually has 🍋 played this game all the way through, 🍊 you have a lot more 🍋 patience than I do. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By the way, if you cor... -- collect 🍋 the letters in the correct, 🍋 uh, order and spell the word, 🍊 you'll get, like, a bonus. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example: 🍋 The second level, we 🍋 have to spell 'horse'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, coming up, here, 🍋 we have the very ugly and 🍋 very difficult Level number 3. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Something that's a little odd is, 🍊 notice that when he jumps he 🍋 actually has a sword in his hand. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If this guy is armed with a sword, 🍊 why does he keep attacking 🍋 his foes by kicking them? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All these little crows and things 🍋 look kind of like little pink worms 🍋 are coming after him, 🍊 yet he'll [only] kick them, 🍋 for some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, at this point in the game, 🍊 "Super Arabian" becomes 🍋 a Platformer of the most annoying 🍋 and unplayable variety. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I tried this for a little while 🍋 but lost patience. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It seems impossible to actually 🍋 jump on the little flying carpets 🍊 without falling right 🍋 through them at times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This level, in particular, 🍋 seems very, very poorly 🍋 designed and thought out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Note that there is a second 🍋 difficulty level on this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have to collect the 🍋 letters in a certain order 🍊 (and you actually can't see 🍋 them until you grab them). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This doesn't really make the 🍋 game any more fun, however. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, this is definitely not a 🍋 promising start for Sunsoft. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later they would come up with games 🍋 with some really great graphics 🍊 but... Man! ...this is 🍋 definitely not one of them! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you combine the ugly graphics, 🍋 the, uh, poor controls, 🍊 the bad hit detection, 🍋 and the general 🍋 unplayability of this game, 🍊 you actually have 🍋 one of the worst games to 🍋 come out for the FamiCom so far. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Block Set 🇯🇵 // Stack-Up 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 July 26 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here we have "Stack-Up" 🍋 (or, as it's actually called on 🍋 the title screen, "Robot Block"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first thing you might notice 🍋 is that Nintendo actually 🍊 got a bit creative with 🍋 the menus on this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For the first time, 🍋 they really seem to be, sort of, 🍋 uh, trying to put a unique menu, 🍊 as opposed to, sort of, 🍋 the standard template 🍊 of the, uh, logo and 🍋 then the options below. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Stack-Up" is the first of 🍋 two games released to be used 🍋 in conjunction with the R.O.B. 🍊 (the Robotic Operating Buddy). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was a basically toy robot 🍋 that plugged into your Nintendo 🍊 and, uh, allowed you to 🍋 play some games with it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This particular game 🍋 required the use of these 🍋 stackable colored discs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The other R.O.B. game, "Gyromite", 🍊 required little spinning, 🍋 uh, gyroscope-type deals. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, unfortunately, this, uh, video 🍋 can't really show the actual 🍋 gameplay of, uh, "Stack-Up". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That would require, you know, a 🍋 video of the actual robot, itself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The, uh... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What you see on the N.E.S. screen 🍋 is really [only] part of the game, 🍊 but what it actually involves 🍋 is giving commands to R.O.B. 🍊 to move the little blocks 🍋 from one stack to another. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's several different 🍋 gameplay variations; 🍊 like, in the first one, 🍋 you, uh, enter commands 🍋 one at a time, 🍊 then the robot moves them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the next gameplay variation, 🍊 you actually enter 🍋 in all the commands 🍊 and then -- 🍋 (once you're done) 🍊 then the robot will 🍋 carry out the commands. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's... -- Furthermore, there's 🍋 something called 'Bingo', 🍊 which is available for 🍋 both one or two players. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The main problem with this game 🍋 is it's not really much of a game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's almost more of 🍋 [an] interactive toy, 🍋 rather than anything else. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suspect that people that 🍋 purchased the version of the 🍋 N.E.S. that had R.O.B in it, 🍊 were perhaps a little disappointed 🍋 when they actually got this home 🍋 and started playing with it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But I don't really think that was 🍋 quite the idea behind R.O.B . 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think it was really more of 🍋 something to entice young people 🍊 into buying the deluxe N.E.S. set, 🍋 rather than anything else. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I think the main purpose of R.O.B. 🍊 was to make the N.E.S. 🍋 in the United States look 🍋 less like a video game console 🍊 and more like some sort of 🍋 interactive toy system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As a result, R.O.B. became 🍋 probably the most infamous 🍊 of the various accessories 🍋 Nintendo released for the N.E.S. 🍊 that were, uh, released 🍋 with much fanfare 🍊 and then, uh, not really 🍋 supported that much. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suspect that most people who 🍋 purchased R.O.B., back in the day, 🍊 probably fooled around with it 🍋 for a little bit, 🍊 and then went on to play more 🍋 interesting games on the Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo's main strength was, 🍋 after all, making great video games 🍊 - not making gimmicky 🍋 things, such as R.O.B.. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Front Line 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 August 01 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Released a mere three weeks 🍋 after "Field Combat", 🍊 we have "Front Line". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Keep an eye out for 🍋 this part right here 🍊 where the demonstration mode 🍋 shows you actually winning a level... 🍊 because you'll 🍋 probably never see that 🍊 while you're playing 🍋 the game in real life. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's hard to imagine anyone 🍋 actually having the patience 🍊 to play this thing all the way 🍋 through to the end of a level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, when you put 🍋 this g... -- game on, 🍊 probably the first thing 🍋 you'll notice is the 🍋 really *appalling* graphics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Look at the way 🍋 your character *runs*!) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then, of course, 🍋 there's the incredibly 🍋 annoying repetitive *music*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, this game was 🍋 released by Taito, 🍊 but it's certainly not the 🍋 best thing they've ever done. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, this game is a terrible, 🍋 horrible, unplayable mess. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, it's also 🍋 historically important, 🍊 because this *was* one of 🍋 the very first of these, uh, 🍋 vertical Run-'n'-Gun type games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These games generally have 🍋 you playing some sort of 🍋 unstoppable super soldier 🍊 battling an entire 🍋 army worth of foes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Arcade Game originally 🍋 came out in 1982 🍊 and it didn't really 🍋 look any better than this; 🍊 the graphics were [pretty] awful. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I'm not 100% sure, 🍊 but I think the Arcade version 🍋 may have had a rotary control. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This would have 🍋 made the game very similar 🍋 to the later "Ikari Warriors". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A rotary controller would 🍋 certainly make the game 🍋 a lot easier to play. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One of the problems is 🍋 simply how difficult it is 🍊 to actually, uh, 🍋 control your character. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You use the D-Pad 🍋 to both move and to aim. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can shoot in eight directions, 🍋 but it's very easy to, sort of, 🍊 shoot in the wrong direction or 🍋 to move in the wrong direction. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you have to move your 🍋 character in the direction 🍋 you want to shoot your gun in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This exact same problem would 🍋 plague the N.E.S. release 🍋 of "Ikari Warriors", 🍊 which is also not a very good game 🍋 (at least for the Nintendo). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is interesting, 🍋 if just for historical reasons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It sort of set the rules 🍋 for this entire genre. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, you have the tanks 🍋 that you can jump into. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If the tank gets hit, 🍋 you have to jump out 🍋 before it explodes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of these elements were used 🍋 in later much better games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's really a shame 🍋 this game is so awful! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Looking at this video, 🍋 it doesn't really look that bad, 🍊 but if you actually sit down 🍋 and try to play it for real, 🍊 you'll probably, uh, 🍋 really start hating it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess this game 🍋 scores points for realism. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of games like "Commando" 🍋 make, uh, war seem 🍋 like a lot of fun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game definitely doesn't. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe that was the whole idea 🍋 behind the game; I don't know! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, unfortunately, while 🍋 this is an interesting game, 🍊 we're gonna have 🍋 to put "Front Line" 🍊 in the same category of 🍋 FamiCom games as "Formation Z" 🍊 - games which are 🍋 virtually unplayable. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Tower of Druaga 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 August 06 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is 🍋 "...Tower of Druaga" by Namco 🍊 - a port of their 🍋 1984 Arcade Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, of all the games we'll 🍋 be seeing in this episode, 🍊 "...Tower of Druaga" is 🍋 certainly the most interesting. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, 🍋 note that it actually has 🍊 a detailed plot described 🍋 in the introduction. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you read through this, 🍋 you'll see that with its, uh, 🍊 kidnapped princesses, 🍋 golden armor, crystal rods, etc. 🍊 this game introduces a lot 🍋 of themes and plot points 🍊 that'll be used in 🍋 later Fantasy games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, this is the 🍋 first Fantasy-themed 🍋 game for the FamiCom 🍊 and the Arcade version 🍋 is one of the very first 🍋 Fantasy games ever in Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the object of the game is 🍋 to scale the tower, floor by floor, 🍊 until you reach the 60th floor, 🍋 where you battle Druaga. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's certainly nothing 🍋 original about this plot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, it's basically 🍋 the same as the old Computer 🍋 R.P.G. game, "Wizardry". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the execution of 🍋 the game places it squarely 🍊 in the tradition of 🍋 Arcade Games like "Pac-Man". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The maze is given a top-down view, 🍋 while the characters are given 🍋 a side or frontal view. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The characters are in, sort of, 🍋 a foreshortened perspective, 🍊 which would later become 🍋 standard in Japanese R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You advance from floor to floor 🍋 by collecting the gold key, 🍊 then killing any monsters in your way, 🍋 and advancing to the exit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You then repeat until 🍋 you reach the 60th floor. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if all this sounds 🍋 rather dull and repetitive, 🍊 well, yes, it definitely is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But... what makes this game 🍋 interesting and different 🍊 is that every level 🍋 contains a hidden item. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A certain action 🍋 must be performed 🍊 in order for a 🍋 treasure chest to appear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Collecting the treasure chest 🍋 will then give you an object. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On early floors, 🍋 the requirements are actually 🍋 usually something [pretty] simple, 🍊 such as killing a 🍋 certain number of monsters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, as you go 🍋 higher up in a tower, 🍊 the requirements become 🍋 much less obvious. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, the game seems to take 🍋 a certain sadistic pleasure 🍊 in making the requirements 🍋 unusual and slightly arbitrary. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, in later levels, 🍋 you might have to, like, 🍋 touch a certain wall, 🍊 or even do something strange 🍋 like hit the Select button 🍋 on your controller. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Some treasures, such as 🍋 the Shoes found on Level 2, 🍋 are very helpful. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Shoes will increase 🍋 your speed, for example. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Others, such as the various 🍋 swords and shields you'll 🍋 collect later in the game, 🍊 actually don't do 🍋 anything by themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, they are necessary 🍋 to getting better treasures, 🍋 later in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While this game 🍋 doesn't seem like much, 🍊 it was enormously popular and 🍋 enormously influential in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, Nintendo would 🍋 take this basic concept, 🍊 improve on it vastly, 🍋 and release it as 🍋 "...Legend of Zelda". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, the concept of 🍋 finding various sorts of 🍋 useful objects and power-ups 🍊 became quite ubiquitous 🍋 in console video games 🍋 in the near future. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, Japanese R.P.G.s 🍋 made extensive use of this idea, 🍊 but also Platformers 🍋 and Action Games 🍊 like "Castlevania", 🍋 "Metroid", etc., etc. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even Mario can power-up 🍋 by collecting mushrooms! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And something else that's 🍋 very interesting is that 🍊 this game transfers 🍋 the players' interest 🍊 from the ostensible goal 🍋 of defeating the wizard 🍊 to that of co... -- uncovering 🍋 all the game's secrets. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "...Tower of Druaga" introduced 🍋 gamers to the mindset of 🍊 fetishistically collecting 🍋 hard-to-find objects 🍋 in video games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This idea carried over 🍋 into all genres - 🍊 not just Japanese R.P.G.s, 🍋 but even straight-ahead 🍋 Action Games 🍊 like the 🍋 'Grand Theft Auto' series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Rather than playing games 🍋 just for pleasure or 🍋 trying to get a high score, 🍊 the object was now to 🍋 'complete' the game 🍊 by finding every secret 🍋 or hidden item. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, oddly, this game was a [pretty] 🍋 big success in Japanese arcades. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, this idea 🍋 for a video game 🍊 really seems much more suited to 🍋 consoles, rather than Arcade Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, more than any other game 🍋 released on the FamiCom so far, 🍊 "...Tower of Druaga" really points 🍋 towards the future of console gaming. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this game was not 🍋 released in the United States, 🍊 but in Japan, 🍋 the '...Tower of Druaga' franchise 🍊 is actually considered to be one 🍋 of Namco's more famous series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This really, sort of, underscores 🍋 some of the differences 🍋 between Western and Asian gamers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Japanese gamers really seem to, 🍋 sort of, have the patience to, 🍊 sort of, grind their way through 🍋 a long and repetitive game 🍊 in order to get some kind of 🍋 ultimate reward at the end. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are a lot of 🍋 things that make this game 🍋 not very enjoyable to play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It really doesn't seem 🍋 to play fair with you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, in the later levels, 🍊 a lot of wizards will be able 🍋 to cast spells across the room. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They often seem to mat... -- 🍋 materialize right next to you 🍋 and suddenly zap you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know how many times I 🍋 was suddenly zapped by a wizard, 🍊 right as I was entering 🍋 the door to exit the room. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, Gilgamesh takes 🍋 an excruciatingly long time to 🍋 sheath and unsheath his sword. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if you were to sit down and 🍋 actually tried to play this game 🍋 through, from beginning to end, 🍊 I can't see you'd probably 🍋 have a very enjoyable time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Still, its influence on the 🍋 Japanese gaming culture 🍋 was huge and undeniable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even the character's name, 🍋 'Gilgamesh', looks forward to 🍋 the Japanese R.P.G. tradition 🍊 of taking names and places 🍋 from various world 🍋 mythology and religions 🍊 and, sort of, inserting 🍋 them willy nilly 🍋 into a Fantasy setting. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The basic combat mechanic 🍋 (using a sword and a shield 🍊 and killing monsters 🍋 by running into them) 🍊 was reused in "Zelda" a few 🍋 months in the near future. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, 🍋 Japanese R.P.G.s, 🍊 such as "Final Fantasy" 🍋 and "Dragon Quest", 🍊 owe a huge debt 🍋 to this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, even [though] this game 🍋 is not actually very fun, 🍊 its influences can be felt 🍋 [pretty] much everywhere 🍋 in the gaming world, 🍊 right on down to 🍋 the present day. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Astro Robo SASA 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 August 09 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Mass Tael Ltd.
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this rather unusual 🍋 little game is known as 🍊 "Astro Robo SASA" 🍋 published by ASCII. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In this game, you play a 🍋 very small little robot 🍊 (or perhaps a guy wearing 🍋 some kind of armored suit) 🍊 with an unusually large gun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not sure what he's 🍋 trying to compensate for 🍊 but this gun has 🍋 so much kick-back, 🍊 you can actually use it to f... -- 🍋 shoot yourself around the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Firing it down will allow 🍋 you to fly up in the air, 🍋 defying the laws of gravity, 🍊 and then you can fire it 🍋 from side to side, in order 🍋 to get you around the screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is to collect 🍋 those energy tanks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing you don't want to do 🍋 is to accidentally have an 🍋 energy tank drop to the ground. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you have an energy counter; 🍊 you will see that at 🍋 the top of the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every time you fire a shot, 🍋 you lose one unit of energy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hitting an enemy will 🍋 cause you to lose more. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You can replenish energy 🍊 by collecting one 🍋 of the energy tanks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you don't have 🍋 any lives in this game; 🍊 you simply play until 🍋 you run out of energy 🍊 and then it's Game Over. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the object is, more or less, 🍋 to collect the energy tanks 🍊 while losing as little 🍋 energy as possible 🍊 (therefore firing off as few 🍋 shots as possible and not 🍋 getting hit by the enemies). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Altogether, there's 🍋 around 16 levels to this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They start off at, 🍋 uh, in the field 🍊 and then move on to, like, 🍋 some sort of Air Force, 🍋 uh, base or something. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually you go into, 🍊 uh, a wa... -- warehouse, 🍋 an undersea se... -- sequence, 🍋 and finally into outer space, 🍊 which again is why they 🍋 call this "Astro Robo SASA". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this game is 🍋 actually a little difficult. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing about it is [that] 🍋 your energy tanks do not 🍋 [replenish] between each level, 🍊 which means that 🍋 basically for each level 🍊 you have to collect 🍋 more energy than you use. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This means playing very carefully, 🍊 starting from [the] 🍋 very beginning level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you do not collect enough 🍋 energy in the early levels, 🍊 you won't have enough to 🍋 actually complete the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game was published by ASCII, 🍋 which was a well-known 🍋 Japanese computer company. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Since the late '70s, they were 🍋 publishing a rather popular 🍋 Japanese computer magazine 🍊 and were a manufacturer 🍋 of hardware and software. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were one of the 🍋 companies that helped create 🍋 the MSX computer standard. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And sometime in the early '80s, 🍋 they started publishing 🍊 Computer Games for the MSX 🍋 and eventually the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This particular game 🍋 was developed by 🍊 a rather obscure company 🍋 called Mass Tael Ltd., 🍊 but I really don't 🍋 know anything about them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For better or worse, 🍋 the success of the FamiCom 🍊 is going to see a lot of 🍋 untried companies attempting 🍊 to throw their hat into 🍋 the video game ring. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Honshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 August 10 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Random House
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by SETA 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this game is 🍋 called "Honshougi: 🍋 Naitou Kudan Shougi Hiden" 🍊 (which apparently translates 🍋 something along the lines of 🍊 'Orig... -- Original Shogi: 🍋 Naitou Nine Step Secret Shogi' 🍊 - or something 🍋 along those lines). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is by a 🍋 company called Seta. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, they actually 🍋 have their little logo, 🍊 uh, plastered th... -- 🍋 right there on the screen 🍋 for the entire game! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The name 'Seta' stands for 🍋 'Super Entertainment 🍋 and Total Amusement'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, unlike a lot of 🍋 the other companies 🍊 that were developing 🍋 games for the FamiCom, 🍊 they were actually a very 🍋 new company - founded in 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is one of their first 🍋 (or possibly even 🍋 their very first) title. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They did a number of 🍋 titles for the N.E.S. 🍋 as well as, uh, Arcade Games 🍊 and they really seem to, sort of, 🍋 specialize in things like this, 🍊 um, as well as Pachinko machines 🍋 and that sort of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm [pretty] sure 🍋 they're still around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, like 'Mahjong' and 'Go', 🍋 'Shogi' is a Japanese game; 🍊 it's actually considered to be, 🍋 sort of, the Japanese 'Chess'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You're playing against 🍋 an actual computer, here; 🍊 he has, sort of, 🍋 electronic claws for arms. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Each player takes turns 🍋 moving a piece. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The pieces up front 🍋 are the infantry. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's other pieces as well 🍊 (various sorts of 🍋 generals, horses, chariots 🍋 - that kind of thing). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The object of the game is to 🍋 capture the main general. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you're thinking, 🍋🍓 'Wait a second! 🍇🍊🍓 This game is 🍋 obviously just 'Chess'! 🍇🍊🍓 This is just a 🍋 rip-off of 'Chess'! 🍇🍋🍓 What were they thinking?🍇', 🍊 well, that's not 🍋 exactly quite true. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Rather, 'Chess' and 'Shogi' 🍋 are actually descended 🍋 from the same ancestor game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This ancestor game, 'Chaturanga', 🍋 originated in ancient India. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, it [spread] 🍋 West and became 'Chess' 🍊 and [spread] East and 🍋 became games like 'Shogi'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, the actual rules and 🍋 moves are, you know, somewhat 🍋 different than European 'Chess'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the game is a bit 🍋 difficult for Westerners 🍊 because it uses, uh, Japanese 🍋 *characters* on the pieces, 🍊 rather than individual *shapes* 🍋 - the way we do it, um, 🍋 in, uh, Western 'Chess'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I really can't say if this game is 🍋 any good at playing 'Shogi' or not; 🍊 I don't play the game, myself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But it certainly, 🍋 uh, is kind of cute 🍋 with its little robot opponent. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose, if you're a 'Shogi' player, 🍋 you might want to try this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is, uh, definitely has 🍋 a little place in history 🍊 as being the first 🍋 'Shogi' game for the N.E.S.; 🍊 many more would follow. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game was surprisingly not 🍋 released in the United States, 🍊 as is the case with, uh, most of 🍋 the 'Shogi' games for the FamiCom. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gyro Set 🇯🇵 // Gyromite 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 August 13 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once we're done listening 🍋 to that great little 🍋 opening musical theme there, 🍊 you'll see that we're 🍋 playing "Gyromite" 🍊 (or "Robot Gyro" as 🍋 it's called in Japan). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Actually, the title screen 🍋 here says "Robot Gyro". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's because the U.S. cartridges 🍋 were basically exactly the same 🍋 as the Japanese cartridges. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Gyromite" is the second 🍋 and last game to use R.O.B 🍊 (the Robotic Operating Buddy) 🍋 for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this game, R.O.B is 🍋 set up to pick up and drop 🍊 two spinning 🍋 gyroscope-like disks 🍊 that rest on a 🍋 blue and red pedal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What this will do 🍋 is open and shut 🍊 the blue and red columns 🍋 that you see in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In this game, 🍋 you're chased around by 🍋 little lizard creatures, 🍊 however, you can, uh, cause 🍋 them to temporarily stop 🍊 by dropping a turnip 🍋 in front of them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They will then eat the turnip 🍋 and you can make a getaway. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The actual object of 🍋 the game is to collect 🍋 all the pieces of dynamite 🍊 hidden throughout 🍋 an individual level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You are, once again, 🍋 playing Professor Hector. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each level is usually 🍋 a few screens in size. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you use these little green 🍋 ropes to, uh, go up and down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And that's [pretty] much 🍋 all there is to, uh, this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The main appeal to this game 🍋 (or rather the main challenge) 🍊 is using the R.O.B. to actually open 🍋 and close the red and blue pillars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've completed a level, 🍋 you'll go on to the next level, 🍋 which is slightly more difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is actually similar to 🍋 a *lot* of games on the FamiCom 🍊 (such as "Wrecking Crew", 🍋 for example). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One of the cool things 🍋 in this game is 🍊 you can actually squish 🍋 the little lizards 🍊 by, uh, closing a 🍋 pillar down upon him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this game isn't 🍋 really that great, 🍊 but before we judge it (or 🍋 R.O.B.) too, uh, too severely, 🍊 remember that R.O.B. was not 🍋 really intended as something that 🍋 Nintendo was going to support. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As far as I know, it was 🍋 mostly intended to be 🍊 sort of a marketing gimmick for 🍋 the N.E.S. in the United States. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I really don't think that 🍋 Nintendo had great plans for R.O.B. 🍊 and then just sort of 🍋 forgot about him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Rather, I think they needed 🍋 a little something extra 🍊 that they could use to help sell 🍋 the N.E.S. to American consumers 🍊 (and, of course, also to 🍋 electronics retailers, as well). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They really wanted to 🍋 make the N.E.S. look 🍋 less like a video game system 🍊 and more like some kind of 🍋 new and unusual toy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The fact that the N.E.S. 🍋 contained a robot and a 🍋 g... -- Zapper gun inside 🍊 really made it stand out 🍋 from other systems 🍊 (like the Atari 2600, 🍋 for example). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once consumers were 🍋 hooked on the N.E.S., 🍊 there was really no 🍋 need for such gimmicks 🍋 such as R.O.B any longer. 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Geimos 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 August 28 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Wixel
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And here we have 🍋 "Geimos" by ASCII - 🍊 credit to the rather 🍋 obscure Wixel Corporation; 🍊 we'll discuss them 🍋 in just a second. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing that is 🍋 unusual about this game 🍊 is that, 🍋 as far as I can tell, 🍊 it's actually an original 🍋 for the FamiCom! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, as you may have noticed, 🍊 there haven't really been 🍋 very many of those, so far, 🍋 not published by Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, the [only] other 🍋 two games that were, uh, 🍋 not ports of something else 🍊 for the FamiCom before this 🍋 were, uh, a 'Mahjong' game 🍊 and the 'Shogi' game we 🍋 saw just a second ago. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every other item 🍋 has been either 🍊 a port of a Arcade Game 🍋 or a Computer Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, if this is 🍋 the way that FamiCom originals 🍋 are going to look, then... 🍊 that's probably not 🍋 really a good thing, 🍊 because this game is 🍋 actually quite terrible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, it's certainly 🍋 very unpleasant to look at. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's one of these 🍋 pseudo-3D Shooters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were a few of these 🍋 around at the time, 🍊 like "Exerion" 🍋 was another example. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This one is... maybe 🍋 even worse than "Exerion"; 🍋 it's really hard to say. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing about these games 🍋 is the, uh, the graphics 🍋 are so... limited! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game actually came out around 🍋 the same time as "Space Harrier". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you look at "Space Harrier", 🍋 here, you see that, 🍊 'Wow! It's got gigantic sprites; 🍊 it actually takes up 🍋 the entire screen.'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By comparison, this game has 🍋 very limited playing space 🍊 and the little, uh, creatures 🍋 don't really get that much bigger 🍋 as they come to you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, certainly 🍋 if you had this game at home 🍊 and then you went the Arcade 🍋 and played "Space Harrier", 🍊 you'll probably be 🍋 sorely disappointed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It does actually have a -- 🍋 I guess a decent-sized boss, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, quite frankly, 🍊 some of the graphics 🍋 in the background 🍋 really aren't that bad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Look there; you'll see a 🍋 gigantic planet in the background. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, parts of it look kinda cool, 🍊 but it's still not 🍋 a very good game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, about this Wixel company 🍋 that actually developed the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, no one really seems 🍋 to know much about them, 🍊 but apparently some people 🍋 think they actually might 🍋 somehow be connected to 🍊 the infamous Micronics 🍋 development company. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Micronics was, sort of, 🍋 known for making some of 🍊 the very worst games 🍋 on the N.E.S. 🍊 and unfortunately, we will 🍋 encounter them a few times. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Beyond that, there's really 🍋 t... -- not too much to say 🍋 about this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Compared to contemporary 🍋 Arcade Games like "Space Harrier", 🍊 this really shows off the, uh, 🍋 limitations of the N.E.S. hardware. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Super FamiCom would 🍋 end up being much better 🍋 at this sort of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was really not 🍋 the FamiCom's speciality. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is also 🍋 an early example of 🍊 a small independent 🍋 development company 🍊 releasing a game for the FamiCom 🍋 that's really not very good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll actually, unfortunately, 🍋 be seeing quite a lot 🍋 of this in the future. 🍇
