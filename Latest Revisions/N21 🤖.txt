👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 21 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Welcome to "Chrontendo Episode 21", the special all-Konami episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, not really but with three big games, Konami totally dominates this episode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are actually several good titles this time around from folks other than Konami. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it's impressive how Konami, more than any other third-party publisher, completely owns the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Counting these three games, that makes about 26 titles for the FamiCom since Konami started putting out games for the console in 1985. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it wasn't until February 1986 (with the release of "...Goonies") that they really started releasing games that weren't just Arcade ports, with exploration-heavy Action Adventure Games becoming their forte. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the end of the year, the we're putting out games designed for the U.S. market. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, let's get going with game that you old-school N.E.S. fans will probably remember. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Highway Star 🇯🇵 // Rad Racer 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 07 🇯🇵 // 1987 October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Square 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Square 🇯🇵 // Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's something we haven't seen in a while: a cartridge published by Square! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They've been focusing most of their energy on the D.O.G. label for the FamiCom Disk System. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But here we have "Highway Star" - a Racing Game (one have to choose between two cars - not too many Racing Game at this time would let you do that). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Square must been making some kind of deals with Nintendo since "Highway Star" was released very quickly in the U.S. in October 1987 by Nintendo themselves as "Rad Racer". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, the U.S. box art shows a speedometer in Miles Per Hour, but the game itself uses Kilometers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and just like Square's earlier "3D World Racer" there's a 3D option which requires the tinted glasses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It is rather curious; supposedly Square was this unsuccessful little Japanese publisher teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, but yet they were having their games licensed by Acclaim and Nintendo for U.S. release. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Regardless, "Rad Racer" is a very cool Racing Game, which takes a [pretty] big page out of Sega's "OutRun". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have a similar in-game map of the track as well as a checkpoint system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to reach each checkpoint within the allotted timeframe or the game will end. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Getting to the checkpoint will add about 45 seconds to your timer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like "OutRun", on the Game Over screen it'll show your progress on the map, so you can see how far you got on that particular course. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I'd say the biggest idea of borrowed from "OutRun" is that the roads are not flat; they have hills and dips. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This not [only] adds to the realism, but also a bit of additional challenge because you can't always see what's ahead of you if you're climbing a hill. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I'll point out the obvious. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Rad Racer" is a great looking game with lots of variety of courses, which tend to be famous locales (San Francisco, Los Angeles, Athens, the Grand Canyon). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Check out how great these night scenes look; they're very impressive looking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The other cars can be a little aggressive and can sometimes be difficult to pass up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hitting a car often Kazuto flying towards the side of the road. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like in "OutRun", if you do take a crash, your car will flip over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One little touch not found in most other Racing Games: Turbo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Pressing Up on the D-Pad will give you some additional speed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this needs to be used very carefully, though it is quite useful for passing cars. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, Racing Game isn't worth jack s--- if it doesn't have good controls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the controls in "Rad Racer" work [pretty] much perfectly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you think back to last episode, we had that Rare game, "Slalom", which controlled like a nightmare. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While "Rad Racer" isn't incredibly hard, you do have to drive [pretty] carefully and cautiously. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you go around corners too fast, it's very easy to wreck. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, you will need to show a bit of aggression when dealing with other drivers at times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There haven't really been too many 3D-style Racing Games FamiCom so far and overall "Rad Racer" is certainly the best of them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it is still a lot of fun to play. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was produced by what I would assume to be Square's, a team saccucci Komatsu and Gabelli (the same guys who have done "3D WorldRunner"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I assume that "...World Runner" and "Rad Racer" were Square's most successful games up to this point. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Bomber King 🇯🇵 // RoboWarrior 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 07 🇯🇵 // 1988 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // Jaleco 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah yes, the often reliable Hudson. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've not cared for most of the Hudson games we've seen lately. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They seem to be going through the typical FamiCom sequel drama, releasing weird sequels to popular games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We saw that awful, "Takashi Meijin" spin-off game a few months ago and now have "Bomber King", the forgotten sequel to "Bomberman". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather nice animated intro, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Planet goes through some sort of terrible ecological catastrophe and then "Bomberman" flies into the rescue. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S. Jaleco (of all people) released it as "Robo Warrior". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hudson's name isn't found on the title screen, though the Hudson bee can still be found in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S. version, your characters a cyborg named Zed and the first thing you do is you pick up some supplies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Funny how video game characters are always so poorly equipped for their missions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You always just dropped off and they'll know where were the gun and one slip of ammo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You think they would give you, you know, some bombs maybe? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You are "Bomberman", after all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, what's the best way to save a planet from environmental destruction? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, blowing up a lot of trees, of course! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! Just like in the first game He had a car Mostly blowing stuff up and looking for bombs and power-ups. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, Hudson decided to modernize the style of gameplay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You now have a Life Bar, lots of different items to use, bosses to fight, and instead of taking place in a series of maze-like rooms, you now have a whole world to explore. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As in the standard 'Bomberman' games, your worst enemy is yourself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your own bombs can kill you quite quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Bomber King" is not a leisurely game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You run on batteries or something and your power is constantly decreasing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You would think that a civilization that's mastered intergalactic travel would be able design a cyborg with a battery life of longer than five minutes... but apparently not. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The secret to this game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A.B.B. (Always Be Bombing). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This being a Hudson game of a certain vintage, there's all kinds of hidden items you have to find. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This level will loop over and over again until you find that chalice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Yeah, I know. A chalice!?). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you see that pool there? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That'll give you some bonus goodies, but you have to bomb the wall multiple times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In order to find the exit to this level, you have to find the key (which, of course, is hidden inside one of those trees). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here's another secret: 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see how that one rock is kind of a little bit different than the rock rocks around it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You blow that up, and you'll find one of the bonus rooms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, you have to bomb the right statues in order to actually collect the goods. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game doesn't really seem to have much of a following nowadays, and I can, sort of, see why. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It can be tough and does have, like, a 'needle in the haystack', sort of, vibe to it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You got to just keep bombing everywhere until you find the items that you need. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are a lot of things to bomb at every level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not really the same to those who are, sort of, used to the leisurely type of exploration that's found in "...Zelda". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, occasionally, you'll find these weird little cave levels are for power-ups and enemies, but you need to use candles to see anything. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is crazy! A robot using candles? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shouldn't you have, like, a built in headlight or something? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! There's the Hudson bee, right there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It is telling that Hudson, sort of, abandoned the 'Bomberman' franchise for a few years after this, before eventually returning to the more classic style of gameplay with "Bomberman 2". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Overall this is a [pretty] good game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If I have any complaints, it seems that your battery life just runs down too darn quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, it is [pretty] easy to screw up while you're laying a bomb and blow yourself up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, that's almost always how I died in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For those who have never played this game, I would definitely recommend giving it a try. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Miracle Ropit's Adventure in 2100 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 07 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Micronics 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by King Records 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I thought "Bomber King" was a [pretty] nice looking game, but we now enter the realm of the truly god damned ugly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Miracle Ropit's Adventure in 2100" from King Records and Animation 20. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 King Records Japanese record label owned by the mega publisher Kodansha, whom we've encountered before. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Among the many, many artists they've had were The Peanuts, those singing twins from the 'Mothra' movies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those of you familiar with obscure Japanese FamiCom games may have noticed another game of theirs with an absolutely amazing title: "Jesus Dreadful Bio Monster". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As for Animation 20, I have no idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As far as I know, this isn't based on anime or anything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Miracle Ropit" is a typical and uninteresting Platformer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I get feelings of nostalgia for "Pocket Zaurus" when playing this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But well that game was a product of Tose, "Miracle Ropit" is from the good folks at Micronics (which explains its utter lack of quality). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You play as a cute little girl wearing some sort of armored robot suit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Getting hit will force you out of the suit and a second it will kill you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also a constantly ticking timer that kills you wear it runs down. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like the Micronics port of "Athena", you don't get any indication of what's happening when time runs out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No animations don't fall down and die or anything fancy like that; it's just Blam, you're back at the beginning of the level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, we have the typically bad game design, goofy enemies, thoughtlessly designed levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Things don't make much sense (like cave entrance that knock you down when you try to approach them). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I got hit, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I love how the music changes completely and suddenly whenever you become the little girl. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's one scary-looking dog. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a look at some of the examples utter stupidity found in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To get past that door there you have to jump up in the air, shoot at once, and then jump up and down on the middle and the rightmost block. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Don't jump on the left block because it'll kill you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here's what happened some time runs out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you weren't keep an eye on the timer, you'd probably be like, 'Did I finish the level? Why am I back on Level 1 again?'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you gotta love stuff like this; you enter that teleportation cave and... it just, for some reason, kills you when you come out the other side. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's another one: 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 Getting hit while on a platform will cause you to jump out of the suit and unavoidably land in the water. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, sometimes even the platform itself will just disappear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, this is a horrible mess of a game and really [pretty] much par for course for Micronics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of all the games episode, this is the one I'd probably advise you definitely do not play. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Elnark no Zaihou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 10 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Towa Chiki 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, let's keep going with the terrible games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next out of the gate is "Elnark no Zaihou" (or '[???] no Zaihou: Treasures of Elnark') - a rather puzzling Action-Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really sure how to best describe "Elnark...". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe it's the world's worst "...Zelda" clone? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, rather than giving us anything interesting to look at "Elnark" provides a boring title screen and a few pages of text describing the backstory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Something about looking for some lost temple in the jungles of South America. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is kind of weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Indiana Jones' ripoffs CMEs were the order of the day for this episode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Published by toa cheeky (whom you might recall from that really unusual Sherlock Holmes game, or homes run around shooting random people on the streets of various British cities and travels around the U.K. by train). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The developer is a shadowy unknown entity. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently their fingerprints have also been found on some Taito games, namely "Mirai Shinwa Jarvas" (that horrible R.P.G. from "Chrontendo ... 19", where you wander around some medieval fantasy world in your astronaut outfit). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And actually this game does share surveys certain aesthetic sensibility with that game If you look at the crappy character animation and the weird, ugly backgrounds on this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, they may have been involved in "Takeshi notos enjo" (that insane Takeshi Kitano game). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's really some resume. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, anyone who's ever loaded up the ROM on this, it's probably said, 'Well, okay, so you walk along the riverbanks shooting monsters until you die. Very nice.'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Entering those tunnels you occasionally come to will warp you to some other part of the riverbank, but it just seems to repeat over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But no, there actually is a trick to this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to use your 'magical stone' to find the hidden way out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Pressing B will occasionally cause a screen to flash. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... But sometimes hitting B in just the right spot will allow you to cross a bridge or into another area. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You do Pick up why I call them power-ups but there's little shields that sort of increase your light/dark meter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's the fairies and little vials of potion that increase your (well, I assume 'P' is for) power. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well eventually after, sort of, going through all this about a million times, you will eventually come to a boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will then enter a hidden temple, find some items, fight another boss, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of the imagery of this game is taken directly from "...Zelda" (like the potions that restore health, and the fairies, and so on). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the whole light/dark bar thing - I'm not really sure what exactly that does. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Elnark" is, sort of, like you gave a very vague description of "...Zelda" someone who had never seen the game and said, 'Hey, make me something like "...Zelda"'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Only] the incredibly curious or masochistic should actually try playing this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, no, I recorded the video for this and then about a week went by and it was now time to record the audio. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I was looking at the Games name in my list of games that I was doing the audio for, I remember thinking, 'You know what? I know I just played this a week ago, but I cannot remember anything about it.'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It wasn't until I actually started loading up the video that suddenly my memory was refreshed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess that should give you an idea of just how memorable this game is. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Saint Seiya: Ōgon Densetsu 🇯🇵 // Les Chevaliers Du Zodiaque: La Legende D'or 🇫🇷 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 10 🇯🇵 // 1992 January 19 🇫🇷 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose | Hect Entertainment 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🇫🇷 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow! First we had a game from our good buddies at Micronics and now Bandai and Tose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you know, this game could be a lot worse. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Saint Seiya ogon Densetsu" is a crazy R.P.G. title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, that's right, Bandai goes R.P.G. - or actually in, sort of, a hybrid turn-based R.P.G. and a side-scroller. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As many as you know, "Saint Seiya" is a long-running and very popular manga anime series created by Masami Kuru Mata. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it was relatively new back when this game came out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in the West, it's known as Knights of the zodiac. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The plot concerns these various orphans who are sent around the world to train to become cosmic warriors (one based on each of the constellations). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then, of course, various dramatic things occur. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, since this is based on the zodiac, you need to start by entering in your birthdate. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And your stats will be based on your astrological sign. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game starts you off with [pretty] much no story introduction, and absolutely nothing will make any sense whatsoever to someone who's not familiar with the series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, maybe that's a little unusual, but really nothing compared to just how weird the actual gameplay is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you face off against another character, you have a menu that gives some options (including 'Talk', which often net to some bonus Cosmo Points which are, sort of, like Action Points). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You use some of the Cosmo Points every turn. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, what you do is you fill up your meters (attack, defense and so on) and then select whether you want to do a Hit or Kick attack. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure if there's really much of a difference. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when being attacked, you can choose to defend by parrying or dodging. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this might sound, sort of, sophisticated and maybe a little bit strategic, but it's not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Battles are really just, sort of, the push the B button, except to actually fill up the meters and then push the button. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, [only] major characters are fought in turn-based battles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your standard run-of-the-mill enemies are actually faced in kind of like Scott side-scrolling Beat-'em-Up sections. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I mentioned this game was released in Japan (oddly enough in Europe in French). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a fan translation here, which gives you a [pretty] good idea of, sort of, what's going on, though I don't think this is actually gonna make the plot any more comprehensible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, when you are facing regular enemies done "akoto new kin"-style - just walk up a bunch of. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the enemy AI (is that we ignore the call this) is probably about the worst in any game in human history. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They literally just stand there while you're punching them and basically walk right into your punch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Can also hit the punch button multiple times It's like a little projectile So you don't really have to get that close to most of the enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You kill these guys for Experience Points and then, sort of, like in western R.P.G.s. you distribute the points between your attributes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't have any, like, levels that actually increase your stats automatically. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, when you're not finding enemies, you can travel to other locations and search out other characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The chick with a purple hair (over she is) her peers whenever you do this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Usually the other character will tell you what to do next. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, I'm going to enter the mansion here and get some instructions to fight in a tournament in a Coliseum. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You actually have to do a little bit of this in the games we're wandering around, kind of, I don't know what the "...Zelda"-style looking people actually talk to you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Turns out the Colosseum, like literally is the Coliseum. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you face some more turn-based battles, and then fight some more normal enemies to get experience, talk to more folks, and move around, and so on so forth. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After getting to a certain plot point, the places you can travel to will change so you can move on to new areas. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, you know, in many ways, "Saint Seiya" is [pretty] terrible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A battle system that sort of complicated but not really at all deep. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The side-scrolling sections are incredibly boring. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And a lot of the incidents from the cartoon are just, sort of, stuck in there was really no explanation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, you know, I do, sort of, admire Bandai for kind of going out on a limb. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a unique idea - turn-based R.P.G. meets a Beat-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are [only] really been a handful of turn-based R.P.G. is released to the FamiCom so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess Bandai was getting a little cutting-edge for this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently someone stoled your armor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot of the plot of this game seems to involve special armor. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are some annoying parts like here, my life is very, very low But when I go to the hospital, the doctors never, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's the [only] way you can pull up your Life Bar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There aren't any, sort of, special items as far as I can tell so here you're [pretty] much stuck. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No idea why the doctor is not showing up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Number one trend we can, sort of, see here is that even publishers like Bandai who, you know, I guess, sort of, mostly is kind of rushed games on the market. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Their games actually are slowly getting a little bit better. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Tose which started out on the FamiCom accommodating horrible, horrible games like that newcomen game is evolving things that are a guest, sort of, approaching playability. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in places the game doesn't really look that bad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like look at the background graphics in the cave scenes, for example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess we're slowly, sort of, seeing things kind of come together for companies like Bandai and Tose. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Almana no Kiseki 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...Episode 21" [pretty] much belongs to Konami. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, let's start with the first of three Konami games, "Arumana no Kiseki" (or "Almana no Kiseki" as the title is usually anglicised). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have Konami's now patented introductory cutscene, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Evil forces steal this magic stone, turning the people of this exotic land into stone themselves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You must find the stone and defeat the forces of evil. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you've noticed the cover to this game, you will certainly figure out the inspiration. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your character is a rather thinly-veiled 'Indiana Jones' imitation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The cover art almost makes this look like an official Indiana Jones game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami was apparently using an artist capable of painting the style of Drew struzan (the guy who did so many of those '70s and '80s movie posters). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, Konami couldn't give you a character a whip; they already used that another game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you start off with throwing knives but you can collect pistols, bombs, and miscellaneous conveyors of death and destruction. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the gimmick in "Almana no Kiseki": 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your character can jump a little, but in order to move from platform to platform you need to employ a grappling hook and rope. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, does this remind you of another game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's not exactly a coincidence. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Almana..." is clearly derived from an earlier Konami game, "Rockin' Rope". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This 1983 Arcade Game had a similar adventure type guy who has a very similar system for moving around on the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Rockin' Rope" was designed by Tucker Fujiwara who shortly thereafter left Konami for Capcom, where he became one of the great video game producers - behind such titles as "Ghosts 'n Goblins", "Mega Man", "Breath of Fire", "Resident Evil" and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes, and in 1987 he designed a game called "Bionic Commando". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, "Almana..." doesn't quite reach "Bionic Commando"s level of greatness. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First and foremost, the controls are not nearly as effortless as they should be. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since most of the game involves shooting climbing ropes, you would really want the climbing mechanism very easy-to-use, but that's not always the case. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing that is incredibly odd involves jumping and shooting your grappling hook. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Frequently, you'll need to give it a bit of elevation and have the hook land in just the right spot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, you would think to do this by jumping and then firing your hook while in midair. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But trying this will [only] result in failure and frustration. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Kind of like trying to jump on this platform, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, the jumping controls aren't very good as well.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead, to this you have to actually fire while on the ground and then jump as the hook is moving through the air. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This (defying some basic laws of physics) will cause the hook to jump upwards as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let me tell you, if you plan to play this game the first thing you'll need to do is make sure to get used to the, uh, firing then jumping. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's completely counterintuitive, but that's just the way it works. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, that was the first boss by the way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Scene takes place on little raft, but the whole, sort of, raft thing is kind of wasted. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It doesn't really involve any kind of interest in gameplay - mostly a, sort of, standing on it and shooting the boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another problem is the way that you'll your hook will fruitland land too close to the wall and firing out a ledge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If this happens, you won't be able to climb up on the ledge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But instead, you'll just, sort of, do like a little dance in the air and then you end up having to climb back down the rope. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This can get [pretty] frustrating and scenes where you have to do a whole lot of shooting of rope climbing up them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like here, for example, where you're being shot at by spears. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, watch what happens when I try to climb up, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oops, put the hook in the wrong spot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, the, sort of, weird controls make platform elements a little bit more frustrating than you would like them to be, and you should expect to die quite a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While you don't automatically die when you fall, it's [pretty] easy to land on an enemy or a sphear or something when you make a mistake. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than enemies, you'll find other hazards like, uh, various sorts of traps and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There'll be the occasional jet of flame that sort of shoots out of nowhere to fry you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Up here we have a [pretty] good example of how to use the jumping mechanism. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fire and then immediately jump afterwards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It does look kind of weird and does take some getting used to. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, another area where all mana is a little lacking is the bosses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They really aren't too interesting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, some of them look cool (like that dragon, for example) but they can be spammed [pretty] easily by using the red sphere weapon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It damages everything on the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm sure you can defeat them by other means, but I found it just a bit too tempting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, all your ammo is limited, so why not use the regular weapons on the regular enemies and the powerful weapons on the bosses? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I'm not really that fond of the fact that your weapons all have limited ammo (even the basic knives). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nowadays, of course, a lot of games have finite ammo (even for the most basic weapon) but "Almana no Kiseki" has infinitely resawning enemies and they respawn very quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They come, sort of, constantly streaming out of those little, uh, doorways that you see all over the place. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while this is a very linear game, there are various goodies to be found while exploring. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I think the limited ammo thing made me play a bit more cautiously since I was so concerned about running out of ammo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess I wish I had like a whip or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the positive side, "Almana..." is (you know, [like] [pretty] much every Konami game) really cool-looking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But again, what's with all the giant skulls? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Someone that Konami must have some sort of skull fetish. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though really, it's not See, Konami isn't just simply churning out a bunch of "Castlevania" clones. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But rather experimenting and playing around with a genre, resulting in games like this one and "Getsufuu Maden". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While this is certainly perfect, it definitely does try to be different. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Majou Densetsu II: Daimashikyou Galious 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next up in our incredible Konami spectacular episode: "Majou Densetsu II: Daimashikyou Galious". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, Konami shows their talent at creating really awesome title screens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's a cool logo, for sure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'But wait', you say, 'margins so to where is number one? I recall no such game.'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, there's a reason for that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Dragon Slayer" IV" (from the last episode) the earlier game wasn't released on FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nope! "Majou Densetsu (I)" (also known as "Nightmare") was an M.S.X. title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember, Konami was a big supporter of the M.S.X. computer format, and put out both ports of Arcade and FamiCom games as well as the original titles for the system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Nightmare" was in 1986 release and looks very similar to Square's "Kings Knight". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both came out the same year, so it's hard to say who was ripping off whom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, "Nightmare" is a [pretty] simple ground-based Shoot-'em-Up, and not particularly enjoyable today. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By 1987, much had changed in the land of game design. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Therefore, "Majou Densetsu II" (originally released for the M.S.X. as well) is a much more modern game - a side view Hack-'n'-Slash setting a huge maze-like castle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much like "...Goonies II", the emphasis is on exploration, finding items and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the crazy thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The 'Nightmare' games had a Hebrew theme to them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While adding Jewish or Christian religious figures into R.P.G.s became trendy in Japan in the '90s, "Nightmare" had them all beat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bosses all have Hebrew inspired names like Elohim, hakoah, and hamelech. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The final boss is a giant horned demon wearing a priests robe and across. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, some of the other names are taken out of Greek mythology. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Nightmare III" another inex title took this further and was actually subtitled "Shalom". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first two 'Nightmare' games were released both in Japan and in Europe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, it is perhaps a bit more well-known than a lot of M.S.X. [only] games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, back to business, here's the FamiCom version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This introduction explains how Aphrodite and Milan are looking for their unborn infant who was somehow kidnapped from Heaven. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How is that even possible? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As was the standard practice that FamiCom release has been reworked. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The general idea is the same but the level of all been redesigned. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main castle has been made smaller, and there are fewer sub-levels, but each of the sub-levels have been made even bigger. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are consequently also fewer bosses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you may have noted, the map there looks kind of similar to the map in "...Goonies II" incidently, what we are playing here is a fan-translated version, which makes navigating the menus and shops considerably easier. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The layout is very "...Zelda"-like with this main castle serving as a hub - with entrances to various dungeons scattered throughout. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You make your way through the dungeon, fight a boss, and then go back to the main castle here, and then repeat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This being a Konami game, you get a wide variety of enemies in each level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You collect experience from killing enemies (which will increase your Life Bar) and gold coins (for buying things in shops). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Notice the, uh, little, sort of, skeleton-like enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you hit them they will come back to life in a few minutes, kind of like in "Castlevania". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so you talk to the bearded white-haired wise guy, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And he'll go ahead and let you go to the first sub-level or dungeon or whatever you want to call these. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's a lot of crosses in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Don't think Nintendo of America would have approved of this, as is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing about "Majou Densetsu II", there's like a lot of items (items you both find in treasure chest and items that you have to buy in shops). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the important ones is a magic sword which So prior to break those up different colored blocks that you see here in, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, you'll need to find a map in each level as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The maps will show you where you are but won't really tell you how to get from place to place. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also find different sorts of weapons, items for increasing your defense, items that'll make the bosses easier to beat - you know, that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is a [pretty] involved game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The levels are [pretty] big and can be a little tricky to navigate your way around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, getting to that this shop. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You, sort of, have to jump down, avoid landing in the water, and land on that particular block in order to go in, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Definitely not easy to find even with the map.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One unique feature: 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can switch back and forth between apparati and popl on at any time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite being simple palette swaps, they have slightly different attributes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes, in order to fight the boss, you first need to go to the room to find a spell to summon him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bosses in this game are a bit shy, I guess. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They don't just appear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You first half to find the spell, then make your way to the summoning room, and then cast the spell; then they'll appear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Check out these awful birds. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're actually much worse than the Medusa heads and "Castlevania"; they're really impossible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'd say that "Majou Densetsu II" is a [pretty] successful game, uh, though (much like "...Goonies II") I think the level suffer from a bit too much sameness. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you are fans of straightforward sideview dungeon crawling, uh, check this game out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here's the first boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's easier to actually summon them, ah, standing on the ladder because being the button Don't actually cause you to jump and so on slow you down. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy looks a lot like the bone dragon from "Getsufuu Maden". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The [only] way I was able to defeat him was by standing directly underneath him to, uh, hit him over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's [pretty] difficult to take out if you actually try to hit him to the front. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I should point out that fans of the series seem to like the M.S.X. version better than the FamiCom version, so that's definitely worth checking out, as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, it's too bad "Nightmare III" was never-released in English, because that game looks very cool and has some absolutely crazy-looking bosses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the way, in case anyone is wondering, these games have no connection whatsoever to the videogame-themed British T.V. show, "Nightmare" (even though there was another game called nightmare based on that show released around that time). 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Mahjong 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You gotta love those colorful logos in these Namco games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hot on the heels of "Family Stadium", "Family Jockey", and "Family Boxing", it's "Family Mahjong". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And interestingly, there is a copyright to Nihan Busson on title screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Terrifying disembodied hands operate the dice-rolling machine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so this is clearly Mahjong game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, like I said last episode, I'm not really going to spend too much time on most of these things. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I will say this "Family Mahjong" is unique among the other Mahjong games for the FamiCom so far, because it features an extensive training mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right, "Family Mahjong" will teach you how to play Mahjong, which is a somewhat complicated game and has many many, many regional variations. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what effect fantastic idea, a game for the whole family! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather than having the kids rescuing Princesses or whatever, let's teach a little bit about gambling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With a bit of practice, anyone can embark on a path that leads to hanging out in gambling dens and owing money to gangsters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, there are the standard play options as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You choose your character (to which are cute girls). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which leads me to another point: Nihan Bussan's credit in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure if this was developed by them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, by the way, we also know Nihan Busson by the name Nichibutsu, mostly known for early Arcade hits like "Crazy Climber". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, by the mid-'80s, they had begun to focus a lot of energy on Arcade Mahjong games (tons of Mahjong games!) many of which featured sexy girls in them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, they really, sort of, pioneered the whole 'play a game of Mahjong and see a girl take off her clothes' genre of Arcade Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, what is Nihan Busson's connection to this game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As far as I can tell, it's not an Arcade port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I really don't know. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess is it secret to everyone. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mito Koumon 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow! There's a lot of speech in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, what would an episode of 'Chrontendo' be without games based on existing IPs? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It would be nothing, I tell you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, we have one here for you now. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Mito Koumon" (the first licensed game from Sunsoft) based on an extremely long-running television show on the main nichi Broadcasting System. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The intro here actually replicates the T.V. show's theme music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there is an incredible amount of text and dialogue in this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, compared to almost any other R.P.G. or adventure type game the N.P.C.s just go on and on and on! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so what does this actually about? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Mito Koumon" takes place in 17th century Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the main character is actually based on a real person. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tokugawa Mensa Cooney - a daimyo (or feudal lord) who disguised himself as a commoner and takes on bad guys, and gangsters, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Mito Koumon" has been on the air, like, literally forever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was ancient when this game came out, and it's still on today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hell! It probably started when we took when he was still alive as a series of woodblock prints. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the map screen travel; you travel around various Japanese cities in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, what, sort of, game is this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess it's a graphical Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It reminds me a bit of Towa Chiki's 'Sherlock Holmes' game, in that it plops you down in some sort of Japanese city and you run around killing the locals and stealing their sweet sweet loot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But some characters actually want to talk instead of fight. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It also reminds me a bit of Konami's "Gonbare Goemon", with the three quarters view and the fact that it seems too bad to kill the ladies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I should point out the combat is very awkward in this game and it's actually difficult to fight people. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Often you have to hit them and then step back. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise, when you're hitting them, they'll just walk right through you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, you have to do lots and lots of talking with the various characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I will admit I could not get very far in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Major issue for me was the female ghost which keeps chasing after me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems to be impossible to avoid and will strip steadily bring your life once latches on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seems to become a theme with Sunsoft as to their earlier games (also set in historical Japan), "E key" and "Taito coaches on tsugi", had a very similar enemy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there's a lot of items here including some washi transform you into another character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, the pinwheel will turn into this guy who can jump and throw projectiles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Among the various things you can do is to actually jump into that building there and, uh, go up in the attic and, sort of, take a look what's going on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even though, probably some kind of plot point will actually happen to do that at the right time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, there are lots of buildings and, uh, to enter and to talk to people. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot of these actually do use speech samples. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There're the typical shops and there's this, uh, noodle joint, here, which you can buy food to restore your health. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Something you'll probably need a lot because you tend to get hit a lot wandering around and there's a damn ghost as well.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you know, um, I guess this could be, sort of, a solid game; it's hard to say. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think the language barrier is kept it [pretty] much unknown in the West. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems like a [pretty] complicated game; you have quite a few items to collect, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the fact that you can actually transform into other characters with their own special abilities make this kind of seem like a long, distant predecessor of "Killer Seven". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, altogether, another rather unusual game from the inscrutable Sunsoft. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Air Fortress 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 17 🇯🇵 // 1989 September [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory | Live Planning 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL 🇯🇵 // HAL America 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, first of all, let me just say the Air Fortresses themselves look [pretty] cool. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 From HAL Laboratory, we have "Air Fortress". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the U.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the title screen, they didn't even bother to remove the Japanese characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, unlike the rather elaborate intros of HAL's "Eggerland" or "Gall Force", here we get the lazy man's intro, the plain text scroll. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Amusingly, the protagonists name is 'Hal Bailman' who's 'a specially trained person'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's nice. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mr. Bailman's job is to blow up all eight Air Fortresses and save the world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like "Metroid" times eight. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, why are those things called Air Fortresses? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, these things are floating in space where there is (you know) no air. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the intro is actually a little weird, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have what appears to be, like, a typical starcraft, which then, sort of, fades into you riding on some kind of like personal spacecraft (like a space jet ski or something). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Air Fortress" has some very nice looking backgrounds; much like "Star Soldier" there's lots of space scaffolding. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Too bad the actual sprites aren't cooler looking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Okay', you say, 'Well, this is clearly a Horizontal Shoot-'em-Up (kind of ripping off "Gradius").'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First time you play this you might think, 'Geez, you know, there really isn't a whole lot of action going on here.'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 True, but "Air Fortress" isn't really a Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those segments are just to prepare you for the real meat of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than avoiding enemies you just grab energy and bombs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Though it is satisfying to be able to actually finally blow up those floating slabs from "Xevious".) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this little shooting section, you enter the fortress. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And now the game becomes vaguely "Metroid"-like - or maybe a little like Capcom's "Section Z". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It mostly involves making your way through the fortress which consists of rooms and corridors, connected by elevators. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can fly or walk but, whenever you are moving, your energy starts dropping. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Standing still will replenish it, but getting hit will permanently decrease your energy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the issue most folks have so far; "Air Fortress" seems too easy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Shoot-'em-Up sections are very basic, and the on-foot parts are really a piece of cake, and you can take tons of hits before dying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is certainly true, uh, up to a point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the fortress, your goal is to destroy the boss (which are these, sort of, generator like things) much like "Section Z" or that 'Gundam' game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you move on to the next fortress. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are even even branching paths at some points, kind of like in "Section Z". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Air Fortress" was developed and released by HAL and even got a U.S. release - one of the very few original HAL games to be released in the U.S. for the N.E.S. (the 'Lolo' games being the other notable ones). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was co developed by Live Planning, who were involved in a few other HAL titles, but otherwise seem [pretty] obscure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, while "Air Fortress" does start off very easy (and you might be concerned about the lack of challenge) it definitely does pick up as you progress. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Shoot-'em-Up sections get more enemies and you'll have to try harder to pick up all the energy and bombs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is the occasional power-up such as, uh, temporary invulnerability, but you wonder, 'Why bother shooting enemies?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They don't really seem to give you points or anything. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can really just avoid most of them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, the on-foot sections do start becoming a little tough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enemies start taking a lot of hits to kill, and will often shoot a barrage of bullets that home in on you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In many cases, it is really impossible to avoid getting hit repeatedly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your energy can be drained [pretty] quickly in the later levels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Right, here, for example, it's kind of difficult to actually walk out of the elevator without getting hit by a whole lot of bullets. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This, sort of, thing makes us feel a bit cheap at times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Air Fortress" is a good game but a little disappointing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess you consider the, sort of, games that HAL would eventually go on to release. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Valis The Fantastic Soldier 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Telenet Japan 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tokuma Shoten 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Mugen Senshi Valis" or "Valis The Fantastic Soldier". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Right off the bat, whatever you think of the quality of the game It has some [pretty] seriously fantastic music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, hell yeah! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is just one of several versions of the first "Valis" game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was originally released on December 1986 on the P.C.-88, M.S.X., and X1 computers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This right here is the P.C.-88 version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, [pretty] awesome music and starts off with some anime-style character portraits. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bad news? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, this game isn't very good (super choppy scrolling and, uh, general ugliness of the in-game graphics). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Computer versions of "Valis" are all [pretty] damn hard to play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These Computer versions were published by Telenet and developed by Wolf Team (Telenet's developer). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They were a company that became [pretty] damn prolific during the 16-bit era. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, they developed a game called "Tales of Phantasia". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And most of them ended up working for Namco (and are now known as Namco Tales Studio). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, here's the M.S.X. version here (again, not very good-looking). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other members eventually split off to form, uh, TriAce (of "Star Ocean" and "Valkerie Profile" fame). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As far as I can tell, all these Wolf Team-developed Computer versions are [pretty] similar. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so going back to the FamiCom, here, it has this rather subtle (auto almost done minimalistic) intro where Yuko obtains the Valis sword. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other versions of the Valis game seem to revolve around Yuko's friend, Riko, getting mixed up with some kind of magical demonic over theme, but I don't really see much of this in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The action looks a bit cleaner on the FamiCom version, but it's still barely playable, due to the fact that your character handles poorly and enemies come pouring out from both sides. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Regular enemies are a huge pain in the ass, but the bosses in this game - Good Lord! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the first one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bosses all move in a simple pattern. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It doesn't really take too long to figure out, but they take forever to kill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, this guy takes, like, 100 hits to kill so really, fighting bosses consistent forming the same movement pattern over and over again for like two, three minutes and then making sure you don't screw up even once. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you do, make sure don't let him get too far away from you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise, he'll actually wrap around the screen and hit you from behind. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, seriously, is that fair? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and if this guy wasn't bad enough, there is an identical one immediately behind him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when I say you can't get even once, here's the thing; you start this game with five Hit Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Regular enemies take away one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bosses (which there are three in the first level) take away two. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are no refills that I know of. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you die, you restart from the beginning. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, getting hit once per boss equals Game Over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, the bosses often just suddenly appear - no fanfare or warning. Just, 'Blam!'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Take a look at this guy coming up, here; he just comes flying in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can guarantee you'll get hit the first time you reach this part of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, extremely long, repetitive boss fights is one of "Valis"' major failings. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, after you get through the first level, you enter the fountain and you get some special Gold armor and are then transported into magical fairy land, where do you need to collect these Phantasm jewels by defeating various bosses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are also various houses scattered around here that talking to people inside will give you hints and important items and that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (This guy gives you a better sword.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this FamiCom version was published by Tokuma Shoten (the big Japanese publisher) who'd previously released "Lot Lot", "Exed Exes", "Ghostbusters", and "Labyrinth". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Odd company, but who developed this version is actually a bit of a mystery. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The layout of the level is completely changed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom version uses, sort of, a layout like "Ganbare Goemon!...", or "touch mystery of triangle" or "St Sega". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The levels scroll left and right, but at various points there are intersections which you can enter (which moves you to a connecting street). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, starting with Level 2, the layout becomes increasingly enormous and maze-like (making it very difficult to find your way around). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are tons of intersections and since most of the scenery looks the same, you'll find ourselves getting lost and wandering on circles most of the time, so have fun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and make sure that you don't get hit by an enemy more than a couple times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm actually playing a hack of the game that gives you a full white bar from the get-go. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will transform the game from impossible to barely playable. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe I'm being just a little too hard on this game, since I'm comparing it to the superior Genesis version and the vastly superior completely rewrote P.C. Engine version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it looks [pretty] good and, compared to the other stuff we've seen, it's actually -- it's really not a bad game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kiki Kaikai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, Taito! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Come on, dudes, make up for that horrible R.P.G. game last episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, this, sort of, puts Taito back in my good graces (a little bit). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's one of those quirky Japanese games with a Shinto theme, "Kiki Kaikai: dotu hin" - which is in fact, the first game in the series that we know in the West as 'Pocky and Rocky'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Any 'Pocky and Rocky' fans out there? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, Rocky's not in this game; it's solo Pocky action. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least we have an introduction to this game, unlike "Jarvis". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seven Japanese Shinto gods have been captured and you must save them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is illustrated a bit more dramatically in the intro to the original Arcade version, seen, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taito had not really gotten the hang of making original console games, at this point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess it's a good thing so I guess it's actually very much a, uh, altered Arcade port. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the original Arcade Game is a ground-based Shoot-'em-Up with a no forced-scrolling (sort of halfway between a regular Vertical Shooter and games like "Commando" or "Ikari Warriors"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You fight your way through a level, reach a boss, then defeat it to free one god. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The enemies are all 'yokai' (Japanese spirits). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your character is called 'cyo Chan' in the Japanese version of these games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade Game was ported into the M.S.X. computer systems and eventually the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But for the FamiCom Disk System release, Taito gave it a major overhaul, as we've seen happen with more and more Arcade ports. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll notice the Arcade version has quite a bit of action (a lot of sprites on the screen at one time). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is, sort of, a 'scary title screen' theme going on in this episode that will fire up the F.D.S. and here we go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, when you see this version, the wonder, 'huh, where's all the enemies?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Funny thing - Taito decided to take almost most of them out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you'll see in this version, "Kiki Kaikai doto hin" is more of an exploration-based Action Game than a Shooter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your projectile weapon (which, uh, seems to be mini ofuda scrolls - or maybe omamori) are unlimited in the Arcade version, but they're very finite, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start out with 50. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And these are little scrolls that have prayers written on them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also have a melee weapon of sorts - a rod with strips of paper attached to it, which is used in the ohare purification ritual. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both of these objects are particularly good for keeping away harmful spirits. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you can't just simply start blasting away to enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It makes more sense to use your scrolls [only] when necessary, and instead use the wand or just avoid enemies entirely. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, hitting enemies with the wand will give you some extra scrolls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can take multiple hits in the FamiCom version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your health is determined by the number of onigiri you have in the upper right-hand corner. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and touching that little statue like we did a moment ago will actually refill your health. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some reason those little triangular rice balls seemed to be a symbol for health and our health power-ups a number of Japanese games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, once you've collected enough scrolls, you'll can enter the boss area. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However it will cost you 50 scrolls, so make sure that you have enough to actually fight the boss afterwards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will need a [pretty] good stock leftover in order to actually take out the boss because they require a lot of hits. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy seems [pretty] easy, but really the main thing is simply to have enough ammo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing about these bosses is you can't play fire them at an angle, so you have to get right underneath them to shoot them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, after you've taken care of the first guy, you will then need to find the next boss, repeat, and then so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are these rather weird little Bonus Rounds that appear right after the boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They actually involved you walking around on clouds and trying not to fall into the invisible holes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After the boss, your maximum health will also increase. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are really no levels in this game per se. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just one large world with lots of intersecting paths going every which way so there's really a lot of wandering about. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I've stated before, Taito is definitely the big Arcade Game company that seems the least committed to console games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is [only] their second FamiCom game in 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And most of their previous releases were simple, straightforward ports have older Arcade titles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Kiki Kaikai" is not fantastic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The schooling is rather shaky (which is unusual for a FamiCom game). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game world is just too big and empty (You never really have a good idea of where you're going). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But Taito is at least starting to show some promise. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Lode Runner II 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Irem 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we have another F.D.S. game from Irem: "Super Lode Runner II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You may recall that "Super Lode Runner (I)" was released in May 1987 and was, in fact, a port of the Arcade Game known sometimes as "Lode Runner 4". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To make matters a bit more confusing, this is simply "Super Lode Runner" with new crazy hard levels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, right off the bat, this game does not screw around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually quite easy to die within about the first five seconds. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As it starts you off with three enemies coming directly at you with really no way out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's just the kind of game that "Super Lode Runner" is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The secret is actually to position yourself just right so that enemies behave in a certain way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can actually get past the one on the right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But obviously this game was not really aimed at casual "Lode Runner" players. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, as you might recall, Irem had the rights to "Lode Runner" in Japan and were releasing new 'Lode Runner' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure if the levels are taken from any of the earlier Brøderbund games or if Irem actually designed them themselves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, it is, I guess, in some ways, a bit surprising to see Irem putting out mostly quickie stuff, unrelated to either big Arcade titles at the time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "R-Type", for example, had just come out in the arcades, but never actually had a FamiCom release. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've covered all the previous 'Lode Runner' games, so you probably remember how to play this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to run around collecting the piles of Gold. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will cause a little ladder to open up so you can move on to the next level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Avoiding the monsters (who Irem have completely redesigned) they look a bit different than they were in the original Hudson or Brøderbund games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can make them fall in a hole by doing a whole year to your left or right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is sometimes easier in theory than it is in practice. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the funny thing is that this being the fourth 'Lode Runner' game, this actually makes 'Lode Runner' the franchise with the most titles on the FamiCom so far (unless you count those 'Family Trainer' gains from Bandai or Namco's Stanley Sports Games). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yes, and this is, in fact, the last load for game for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dracula II: Noroi no Fuuin 🇯🇵 // Castlevania II: Simon's Quest 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 28 🇯🇵 // 1988 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, it's time for Konami game number three (and definitely the most well-known of this episode's games) "Dracula II: narrowly no foolin", the sequel to "Akumajou Dracula", and one which is not used the word 'Akumajou' in the title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a direct sequel to the first game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite being destroyed by Belmont, Dracula's tool poses some sort of threat, and you need to take care of him once and for all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, in the West, we know this game as "Castlevania II: Simon's Quest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, we do get a much lamer, less bloody title screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, since this is 1987 this is 'Castlevania' with an R.P.G. twist. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, Konami took 'Castlevania' in a "Zelda II..."-style direction, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's another black sheep title in the franchise, and one which remains odd and baffling to this day. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In true "Dragon Quest"-style, you start off in a town full of N.P.C.s, a church to heal in, a few things to buy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Right off the bat, "Castlevania II" shows its weird side. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These towns are like these multi level affairs (usually waterways along the ground). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right; you can actually drown in "Castlevania II" in the town if you're not careful. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You feel more like the, uh, you're in the streets of Venice, then some Transylvanian village. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The N.P.C.s gives some confusing advice (more on that in a bit). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you can buy the White Crystal (which is a vague mysterious object) that is unhelpfully described in the manual as 'a source of magic power'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, a few minutes in the game defies your expectations for the first time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might still be looking around the town, trying to figure out what your first objective is, when suddenly night falls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (It's funny every night is a horrible night to have a curse around here.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All the townspeople are gone and the doors locked (even the church) and then terrifying green zombies are everywhere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you leave the town, the normal countryside monsters have increased in strength significantly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the standard R.P.G. rules (towns are safe havens from harm) is completely tossed out the window. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I mentioned that "Castlevania II" is a bit like "Zelda II..." at least in the world structure - a series of towns and dungeon-like castles, separated by stretches of road populated by enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, there's no overWorld Map, so it's not always that easy to find a way around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most towns are kind of tricky to find. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another notable thing: the music, it's amazing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Take, for example, the track that plays while Simon outside in the daytime: "bloody tears" (This the Japanese version, by the way). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sounds a little different due to the different sound hardware. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Strangely, the music in "Castlevania II" is composed by Kenichi matsubara, rather than canoe yo Yamashita who did the first one. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually will come to a castle we're in the first of the Dracula's Relics is capped. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I know; you killed him in the first game and buried underneath the castle, but somehow has various body parts ended up in these castles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, you think you're stuck here, but that's actually what the White Crystal is for. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmm. Isn't that obvious? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, you can jump on the platform and actually enter the castle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 These castles are a bit less linear than these similar environments in the first game, and you will always need to find an old guy somewhere in the castle who's selling these rather overpriced wooden stakes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to, uh, collect those in order to get Dracula's relics, for some reason. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there are, uh... -- The controls are a bit tricky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like in "Castlevania (I)", The jumping is difficult. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This occasionally becomes problematic (like in this sequence here). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have these almost impossible jumps and you can't wait control your character in midair. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, as you may have gathered, "Castlevania II" is a quasi-R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have Experience Points, and money, and quite a few items to find your buy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In "Castlevania (I)", you [pretty] much upgraded your whip immediately. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Here, you have to buy better whips throughout the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yes, and Dracula's relics serve some sort of function if you actually equip them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, the manual doesn't tell you what those functions are. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, going back to the weird things in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... There're not bosses found in every castle and they're handled much more differently than the first game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While they are large and decent looking, there's really not much strategy involved - just button mashing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And compared to the first game, they're all very easy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... But here's the crazy thing; watch this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You encounter Death, but you can walk right past him; you don't actually have to fight him unless you want the sub-weapon he drops. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are so many bizarre and maddening things in this game (here, for example, a dead end). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you equip the right crystal and then kneel down, you can somehow actually pass underneath the lake. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That doesn't really seem to make a lot of sense, when you think about it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or here, for example, you can wander around forever in this castle and not get anywhere because you need to jump through the fake wall. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, "Castlevania II" is full of the most absurd secret patches requiring you to perform some sort of arbitrary action or equip something in order to be revealed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As mentioned, the manual gives you virtually no clues about using the various crystals not required to get through the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the N.P.C.s - they often give you this rather bizarre, irrelevant, and incomprehensible advice - like 'the graveyard duck'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what is up with this woman? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, and many things they say are actually completely false; they will actually lie to you about what you need to do. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's another bizarre one that seems to have no bearing on the game whatsoever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This turning of standard video game practices on its head was also found in another Konami game released around this time, "Metal Gear". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also get some very bad advice in that game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Castlevania II" might be thought of an early attempt as, sort of, a postmodern video game - one that is aware of the rules and tropes down to these kind of games, but the little league breaks them in order to disorientate the player. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bosses and enemies often present little challenge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have a Life Bar and three lives but dying isn't a serious setback. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it makes sense to deliberately die at points (especially after you're Leveled Up). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, you get some rather bizarre interaction with the N.P.C.s, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Castlevania II" is a very good-looking game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's wonderful use of color and atmosphere and check out your spectacular flaming whip that you eventually get. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The music is obviously fantastic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The monsters are creepy like these guys (here you are in a graveyard). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's all very, very cool. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you cross this very long, empty bridge, you'll enter the final castle, and you'll get you'll get some very spectacular, spectacular, gloomy hypnotic music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That track is [only] called "within these castle walls". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This level is entirely devoid of enemies, other than Dracula himself (who turns out to be a much easier final boss than in the first game). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, many things in this game seem wrong. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The most difficult thing about the game is finding your way around the game world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the story doesn't really make much sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, Simon is inflicted with some sort of vague curse by Dracula and can [only] be cured by bringing him back to life and killing him a second time? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And how exactly this burning Dracula's body parts resurrect them? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Isn't fire traditionally unhealthy for vampires? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And unless you've finished the game super fast, the epilogue has Simon dying even though he's defeated Dracula. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, what's going on here? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And is that Dracula's grave? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seems weird that you'd want to give Dracula the courtesy of a funeral and a nice headstone. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, it's difficult to know what to make of "Castlevania II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's very weird and disorientating, but this must have been done deliberately. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's almost avant garde the way it messes with the player (though not to the extent of "Takeshi no Chosenjou"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, not everyone likes this game, but just like 'Super Mario', '...Zelda', and so many others. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After the first sequel, the 'Castlevania' series returned to its roots and released a series of games ('Castlevania's "III", "IV", "Rondo of Blood", and "Symphony of the Night") that make up the Golden years of the series. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Transformers: The Head Masters 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Zap Corporation 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Takara 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, we've just got one more to cover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the fine 'Chrontendo' tradition of ending the episode on a really crappy game, it's a new 'Transformers' game from Takara! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hurray! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully you'll all remember "Convoy no Nazo" from December 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, Transformers The headmaster's is a lot like that game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Convoy no Nazo" was bought by ISCO. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But "...Head Masters"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, no one seems to be in a hurry take credit for this one. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is surprisingly an F.D.S. game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I suppose you can save your progress in the unlikely event that you actually play it more than once. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This looks like a couple earlier games, uh, "Daiva" (that oddball game from teeny software you select your planet then go to like a lame side-scrolling Shooter sequence) or maybe "Galaxy Odyssey" (where you select the planet and run around all sorts of sub sub sub "Metroid" Space Station). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also the game takes big chunks from the "Macross", "Hot Scramble", game and "Thexder". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you get these awesome side-scrolling Shoot-'em-Up sequences (much like "Convoy no Nazo") but with two big differences. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can't transform into a robot, first of all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Now, wait a second', you say, 'this is a Transformers game that does not let you transform?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, you're actually stuck in vehicle mode; {that} makes perfect sense. 🙄 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the way, there you just may have seen me collect another Transformer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, you'll see them flying above-head, you can shoot the ship that's carrying them that way you can actually switch back and forth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This makes the game a bit easier, I suppose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, these boss sections are horribly annoying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can [only] shoot at a 45 degree angle, so you can't really aim or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you take the boss out, we'll move on to the 'inside the base' sequence. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned earlier, this game, sort of, resembles the 'Macross' game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the way, "Head Masters" is based on the Japan-[only] "Transformers Animated Series". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The follow-up series has the absolutely amazing name of "Transformers Super God Master Force". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's certainly sounds impressive. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, while this is not as bad as "Convoy no Nazo", it is still [pretty] terrible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I get this a bit more playable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, the enemies don't like, sort of, dive right at you like you did in the first game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You actually have a Life Bar so it's like you're gonna get like, sort of, killed every two seconds like in a "convoy". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, it is a really boring game, especially the segments where you're playing in vehicle for. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is definitely one to avoid. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 21 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, sorry about that 'Transformers' game, but lousy games are just part and parcel of this whole project. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But next time we have a really great Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And naturally it's from... Konami. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami, why must you be so consistent? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also the little scene first in Korean one of Japan's longest running R.P.G. series, a fondly remembered "...Zelda"-style Adventure Game, and a game from Nintendo you probably have never heard of. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not to mention another game based on line of robot toys, and yet another 'Family Trainer' game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh my God. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Will those 'Family Trainer' games never stop? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At any rate, I will see you then. 🍇🍌
