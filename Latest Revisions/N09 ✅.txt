👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 9 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah, yes. Welcome to "Chrontendo Episode 9"! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We're going all the way back to summer of 1986. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo [of] America is busy promoting its still relatively new Nintendo Entertainment System, and they will release one game, "Gumshoe", in the United States that was never released in Japan! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, in July of 1986, Sega releases its Sega Master System in the U.S. as well, thus extending the Nintendo/Sega rivalry to the U.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, this episode, we'll see Hudson Soft release a great Shoot-'em-Up for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Konami will continue to release some [pretty] good games for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And Namco will step up to the plate with a rather "...Zelda"-esque R.P.G. game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, finally, we'll see three original games from Nintendo themselves - which is an unusual occurrence at this point in the FamiCom's lifespan. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 B-Wings 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 June 06 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And our first game this episode is Data East's "B-Wings". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is a Vertical Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a port of Data [East's] 1984 Arcade game, and they've actually added some things for this FamiCom version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, you can actually select from quite a wide variety of power-ups here at the very beginning. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some of these are quite a bit more useful than others, as you can imagine. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Throughout the game, you'll have the opportunity to change power-ups occasionally, and if you get hit, you can actually lose your power-up and be stuck with the, uh, rather lame laser cannon that's the default. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the Arcade version, right here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {This is} not bad music on the Arcade version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I actually haven't received any power-ups yet. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You start off with nothing at all; you have to shoot them down and collect them later, as is standard for most Shooters. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The whole idea of choosing your power-up at the beginning is interesting, but, uh, the execution on this game doesn't really quite pull it off very well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This actually reminds me a lot of "Argus" with all these various sorts of floating objects here that you have to either blow up or get out of the way. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Some power-ups are more useful than others, as I mentioned. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes it'll, sort of, give you a hint, like giving you a power-up, um, that will actually come in very useful [in] the next section. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, here, all these little tiny things kind of come flying at you, and this thing which, uh, sort of, shoots off very short rays in all directions will help you get through this next section here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This was the first game that Data East themselves released for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some of their other games had come out, uh, by other publishers such as "BurgerTime", for example. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But they would end up becoming a re... -- reasonably prolific creator of FamiCom games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They would release a lot in the United States as well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They had some U.S.-[only] titles, so we'll be seeing the name Data East quite a bit from now on. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here I have the fire power-up, which is pretty useful for dealing with, uh, this boss, as well as all the missiles that come at you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} sort of, a shame that the, uh, first game on this episode is so mediocre. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, oddly enough, {the} next game we'll be looking at, "Star Soldier", is also a Shoot-'em-Up, and it's substantially, substantially better than this one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, I'd say it's probably really about the first, you know, one of the best Shooters on the FamiCom so far, {if} maybe not *the* best. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... So, here we are, sort of, finishing off the boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I} hope you're not expecting a big explosion or something like that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} looks like he just lost power. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, yeah, um, it's pretty much your average typical Shoot-'em-Up of this era. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Star Soldier 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 June 13 🇯🇵 // 1989 January [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // Taxan 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, oddly enough, our second game this episode is also a Shoot-'em-Up, "Star Soldier" by Hudson Soft. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And as it turns out, this game is vastly superior to "B-Wings". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, I would probably go so far as to [say] this is actually the best original Shooter for the FamiCom yet. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Star Soldier" is, sort of, theoretically a sequel to "Star Force", even though that game was not actually designed by Hudson. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, this game would have later sequels as well, which are quite well-known, such as "Stup..." -- "Super Star Soldier" and, uh, "Soldier Blade". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Star Soldier" really does seem to embody a lot of the elements that, uh, make up a good Shooter (at least a good console Shooter). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, you have a variety of power-ups, including, uh, well, you see, where there we can fire both forwards and backwards. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Later, ya get, like, more of, like, a -- a spread shot that goes all around you as well as shields. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Occasionally, you'll get a power-up that will explode everything on the screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And of course, you have a wide variety of en... -- enemies, and lots of things to shoot at, and lots of ways to get extra points. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of the bosses; actually, it's really not bad looking for a game of this vintage. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly enough, there is a timer on the bosses. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you don't defeat 'em within 30 seconds, you actually have to do the entire level again. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, some people might find this to be pretty frustrating. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And also there are numerous hidden items as well in "Star Soldier". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, you'll, uh, be shooting and uncover something that, uh -- a letter shape that [will] give you some kind of power-up or bonus points. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We'll actually see a couple of these during the gameplay video. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's hard to say what makes this game, uh, so much better than a lot of the other Shooters we've seen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! There's a 'Z' right there; I missed picking it up, but you can see it right as I, uh -- I hit it just a little bit too late. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, here is the, uh, the spread shot here, and here is the -- the big boss that, uh, appears every so many levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's actually relatively hard, and, quite frankly, the, uh -- the spread shot is not quite as effective in taking him out -- (or) taking the bosses out as the, uh, straight-ahead fire is. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you can hit a couple times, uh, you'll be reduced down to the, uh, the double fire, which is much more effective for taking out bosses. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, unlike a lot of those older games, uh, "Star Soldier" just feels right. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Has a lot of firepower, a lot of things to shoot, lots of different kinds of enemies;, sort of, strange things appear (like the eyeballs and whatnot). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing that might take a bit of getting used to is {the} fact that you can go both above and below the various floating platforms in space. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Not everyone seems to understand this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... I was reading, I think, one [mention] {of} this game, and they actually thought that was, like, a problem in the [emulation], but you can actually control it by pressing Up or Down right before you, uh, pass something. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The going underneath platforms can actually {be} very helpful. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Sometimes there are areas where there's pretty heavy enemies (um, ones that, like, move very fast, for example, and difficult to dodge). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you just go underneath the platform right before that particular enemy appears, you'll find it to be quite helpful. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, all in all, I'd say that "Star Soldier" is a great game, perhaps the best Shooter on the FamiCom other than "Gradius". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is certainly, uh, Hudson Soft taking perhaps the first steps in becoming one of the best Shooter developers on the consoles (the other one, of course, being Compile). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, this is certainly, uh, kind of where it all started for Hudson Soft. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Makiamura 🇯🇵 // Ghosts 'n Goblins 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 June 13 🇯🇵 // 1986 November [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom | Micronics
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Released the same day as "Star Soldier" is Capcom's "Makiamura", or "Demon Village" (known in the United States as "Ghosts 'n Goblins".) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game opens with the infamous cutscene of Arthur lounging in the graveyard with his girlfriend, Princess Prin-Prin, in his underwear. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 What exactly is going on here? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We'll never know. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When Prin-Prin is kidnapped by a demon, it's up to Arthur to traverse the demon village and get her back. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the original Arcade version, right here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, what needs to be said about "Ghosts 'n Goblins"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's an all-time classic, that's for sure - one of the games (along with "Commando" and "1942") that put Capcom on the map. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game was designed by Tokoro Fujiwara - the same guy who developed "Commando" and "Mega Man". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When "Ghosts 'n Goblins" hit the arcades in 1985, it immediately made gamers take notice, not [only] for its great graphics but also the game's sense of style and humor. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps more than anything else, the game had really cool level design and character design and animation (not to mention it was incredibly hard). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If, by some chance, you managed to make it all the way to the last level, you would find yourselves transported back to the beginning of the game and have to go through the whole thing again in order to get to the ending. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} game was quite a hit and was converted to a number of different systems. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When this one came out in 1986, it was almost certainly the best-looking "Ghosts 'n Goblins" at this time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, how does it compare nowadays? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, the graphics are pretty ugly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {In} terms of the gameplay, well, once again, this game was ported by Micronics, the same company who did "1942", "Exed Exes", "SonSon", and a few other disastrous Capcom conversions. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While this version does look a lot like the Arcade version, it actually plays a bit differently. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, this guy is *harder* in the FamiCom version than in the Arcade version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Why would they wanna make the game harder, I wonder? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game just does not control nearly as well as the Arcade version; {it} just sort of feels a little bit weird. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Technically, the game does not look nearly as bad as some other Micronics titles, but, uh, certainly there would be better versions of this released in the future. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this game actually sounds pretty decent. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Ghosts 'n Goblins"' famous theme music actually makes it pretty much intact here (much better than the horrible, uh, annoying rat-a-tat-tat soundtrack of, uh, Micronic... -- Micronics', uh, "1942"). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess we can say about this, uh, FamiCom "Ghosts 'n Goblins": it's certainly the best thing we had at the time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game is actually more difficult; the controls are a little stiff (just feels a little weird playing it); um, there is some sprite flicker but not really too much slow down. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess the bottom line is that in 1985 "Ghosts 'n Goblins" was {a} state of the art Arcade game - something the FamiCom simply could not reproduce accurately. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On the plus side, this (I believe) is actually the last game that Capcom hired Micronics to port. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the future, they'll be doing all their, uh, FamiCom versions themselves - with, uh, hopefully much better results. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Chinese 🇯🇵 // Kung Fu Heroes 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 June 20 🇯🇵 // 1989 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nihon Game
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // Culture Brain 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is "Super Chinese" - a game with [an] incredibly strange name (thankfully changed [to] "Kung-Fu Heroes" for the U.S. release), not to mention a very annoying soundtrack and, uh, sound effects. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This guy is supposedly some kind of Kung-Fu master, but why is he always making noises like a barking dog? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, this game was published by Namco but was actually developed by a company called Nihon Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, in the credits, they refer to themselves as Micro Academy, and later they would change their name to the even worse Culture Brain. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess they had a thing for really weird-sounding names. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There were a couple {of} sequels to "Super Chinese", uh, and they were all actually quite a bit different. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They, sort of, went more in a R.P.G. game, uh, mode a little bit later in the series. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, let's take a look at this very first game here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You play this, sort of, Kung-Fu master dude; you wander around {and} you beat up people. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is simply a series of, uh, single-screen levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The object of each screen is to keep killing people until you, uh -- there's a certain number of people [that] we have to kill, then you exit the screen and go on to the next one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, you, uh, will bust open a rock and find a secret, uh, passageway to a bonus level, which we saw just a second ago. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You have a few different attacks; you can punch, you can do a very handy little flip jump. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (I've just completed the first level here, as you can see.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the game is actually done, sort of, in a very strange kind of a top-down but three-quarters view. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing about this game is that hit detection is a little weird. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a lot of times when it looks like I'm actually hitting something, but I'm not. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, occasionally, this guy will come along. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... If he does appear, uh, I wouldn't advise you try to fight him. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Just run and hide because he'll kill you pretty easily. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [then] the level resumes to normal. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game actually does have a few very minor R.P.G. elements. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You see the little fist up at the top, there? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's kind of like your strength. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you [can ya need to] really, sort of, uh -- need [to] keep busting open blocks [and] try [to] find various little, sort of, power-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some are temporary, but others will actually permanently increase your strength. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, in this level, you need to be a strength of three in order to kill the, uh, various enemies walking around (these guys wearing buffalo hats, for some reason). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, I just found a power-up; now I'm able to dispose of them with my fists. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this game does play a little strangely; it sort of feels weird. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, the hit dissection -- hit detection seems very strange at times. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It is a bit of a repetitive game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, you'll get, like, another kind of power-up there, like there's, like, little fireballs you can throw. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can also collect those little, uh, 'E' icons and do, like, some kind of, like, superkick, which I actually don't really find very useful. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 “Culture Brain" eventually released this game in the United States themselves in 1989, by which time it must have seemed impossibly old-fashioned. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They would go on to create better games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sqoon 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 June 26 🇯🇵 // 1987 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Home Data
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This next game is "Sqoon" and right away, take a look at this title screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a topless mermaid holding a glowing crucifix. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 How exactly did this one slip past Nintendo's censors, I wonder? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game was published by Irem, but actually developed by a company called Home Data ({the} same guys who did "Penguin Kun Wars"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And while that game was pretty fun, I find this game to be not fun at all. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's very similar to "Choplifter", of all things, which is kind of odd because "Choplifter" was released for the N.E.S. on {the} same day as this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, right away, if you move your ship over the cross, you can get a extra life. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So the story here is that N... -- Neptunians have invaded Earth and have caused all the oceans to rise, and it's your job to save mankind. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And quite frankly, looking at the State of New York City there, I'd say it's probably maybe a little too late. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, I don't know what's going on with the hit detection in this game, but I've looked at that little sequence there when I tried to bomb that little, uh, prison, and I saw my missiles go right through that prison several times, and it did not register a hit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Something about this game is just weird. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I don't know; I just can't stand playing it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Maybe it's the annoying enemies, maybe it's the way that whenever you go down to, uh, bomb a base, suddenly a huge wave of enemies comes and hits you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... The object is really just like "Choplifter" (or maybe even "Defender") - move along, kill everybody, when you come across some prisoners being held in [little] underwater bases, bomb it, grab them before the sharks eat them, and then, uh, take 'em to the little floating island up ahead. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You have a fuel gauge which gets refueled whenever you, uh, bring prisoners into the little floating island. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I don't know, just everything about this game, sort of, screams, ya know, [that] they didn't really put a whole lot of effort into it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... I tried playing it for a little bit, but just (I don't know) -- I just could not get into this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe other folks will have better results. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I re... -- I really don't know. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Let me tell ya; the fact that Irem has released this game and "Spelunker" really makes me, uh, not have too much respect for them, based on the stuff they've released for the FamiCom so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gumshoe 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 June 06 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, we have another historical moment coming up here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is "Gumshoe". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Take a moment to read this "Spartan X"-like letter. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is another kidnapped girl-type game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The object is to find these, uh, five diamonds called the Black Panthers. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, what makes this game unique and historically interesting is that this is the first game that has [only] been released for the N.E.S., not for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was released in the United States in June of 1986; {it was} never released in Japan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, while the FamiCom has had the release dates (the exact release dates) documented very well, this isn't really the case with the American N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [when] we're looking at U.S.-[only] games (Oh, I got the first, uh, diamond, right there.) -- when we're looking at U.S.-[only] games, we'll usually [only] have the month and the year, not the actual date. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Why was this game not released in Japan? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well -- Well, remember that Nintendo was trying to use the [existence] of the Zapper to help sell the new N.E.S. system. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I think they simply needed more Zapper games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In Japan, I think they had pretty much given up on the whole Light Gun idea, but in the U.S., it was still a major selling point. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And of course, remember, at this time, there were really not that many games available for the N.E.S. in the United States, where -- while there were plenty available in Japan, so I guess Japan simply didn't need this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, how do you play it? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, uh, you don't control this guy directly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He simply walks along in a straight line, and you use the gun to either shoot him and get him to hop up in the air or to shoot projectiles coming towards him. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Shooting the bird will give you some kind of power-up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this case, when your overcoat is, uh, pink, he can take one hit before dying. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 What you wanna watch out for are things like birds, flying bottles, cars, bombs, those little skull things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Colliding with one of those will kill your guy.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this case, because I have the, uh -- I had the pink overcoat, I was able to survive one hit. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you get to the end of the level, you will find, uh, some sort of, uh (well, in this case, it's) an elevator to take you on to the next level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then, of course, we've gotta find, uh, (well, I guess we've gotten two so far) we gotta keep finding those damn diamonds. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, {it's} sort of a fun little game - a little different. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... {It} kinda [reminds] you of the can-shooting thing in "Hogan's Alley" ([only] the entire game). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... {It's} perhaps not the best Light Gun Game on the N.E.S., but it certainly could be a lot worse. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Choplifter 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 June 26 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Jaleco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 From Jaleco we have "Choplifter". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And yes, this is a port of the antique American PC game, originally from 1982 in the Apple II Computer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We've definitely seen some old Apple games be ported to the FamiCom, at this point, but why they chose to do this particular game, I really don't know. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was quite popular when it first came out, but it had already been ported to pretty much every single system you could possibly think of. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Honestly, I think by uh, 1986, even slide rules had this game ported to it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The object (if you're really not familiar with this game) is very much like "Defender". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You, uh,  fly a helicopter, go around, blow stuff up, and try to rescue the hostages. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yes, this game is not merely about mass murder. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [only] reason you're actually killing people is because you wanna rescue those hostages [which] are being held captive in some unknown desert nation. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The controls of "Choplifter" are a little bit weird; you use your D-Pad to move u... -- move up and down and then move from side to side. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You actually have to use the B button; I believe it is to, uh, turn your helicopter around. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hitting the B button once will turn it a, uh, 90-degree angle. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once you've got the first batch of hostages safe and sound, go out and do it again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While I guess this game seemed pretty impressive, in its day, I don't really think it had aged that well in 1986, much less in 2008. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The shooting is pretty simple. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, quite frankly, you can avoid a lot of the gunfire simply by flying at the top. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, you have to do a little bit of dodging and swerving. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... {That'} not to say {the} game is really easy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The fact that your airplane (or rather) -- your helicopter controls so slowly makes the game a little frustrating, quite frankly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess just compared to the kind of Shooters that were coming out at this time (such as "Gradius"), this game just seemed absurdly old-fashioned and really not too terribly fun to play. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But you never know; maybe you'll have some fun with it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Me, I -- I personally don't really care for this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If they're releasing games like this for the FamiCom, then what's next? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A port of "Oregon Trail"? 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kanshakudama Nage Kantarou No Toukaidou Gojuusan Tsugi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 July 03 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is from Sunsoft, and the title is usually known as "Toukaidou Gojuusan Tsugi", though the actual title, as you see here, is a bit longer. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In this game, you play a fireworks maker who, for some reason, has to journey from Kyoto to Edo. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, along the way, you will naturally encounter a lot of ninjas. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This first level here is just, sort of, an introductory level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As a fireworks maker, your weapon of choice is little explosive bombs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, as you can see, since the bombs travel in an arc when you throw them, it can be rather hard to hit an enemy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Probably the best strategy is to actually jump while you're throwing the bomb. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or you can try throwing a bomb right before an enemy touches you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once you get past this very short little level here, you move on to the real game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, this game is actually based on the 53 stages of the Tokaido (which is a major Japanese road that's been around for quite some time), which links Edo and Kyoto. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In Japan, this road and its various [stations] are quite well known, um, so the ti... -- game's title would have quite a bit of cultural significance for a Japanese gamer (not so much for, uh, Americans). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, this is a pretty simple jump and, uh, throw stuff kind of Platformer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That guy actually has a gun, so it's best to avoid him. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, you'll cr... -- have to, uh, jump over a river or something like that. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game actually [only] has 21 stages. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... So apparently, not every single stopping point along th... -- to the, uh, Tokaido Road is actually covered in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 What we're looking at here is actually an unofficial English translation, just so we can, sort of, read the, uh, between-level inner titles. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {I'm] not really sure who developed this game, if it was Sunsoft or if they used an outside developer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's not exactly bad, but it's not exactly exciting either. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's, uh, pretty much a standard Platformer for the time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I believe this is, uh, not actually an enemy, {but} rather a woman (perhaps a prostitute) {who} sort of, latches herself onto you). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly enough, there's a very similar type of character in the game "Ikki", which we saw earlier. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A little later, you'll see, like, a female ghost that chases after you and probably wants to do something similar. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While playing this game, you will occasionally collect Gold coins or various other objects, but I haven't really figured out what exactly they're for. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I will admit, there are certain elements of this game which are still a mystery to me. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you take a bit more time playing and, sort of, looking into it, you might get a bit more out of it than I did. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Babel no Tou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 July 18 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, we have a lot of Puzzle Games this episode, and this is the first one, "Tower of Babel", or just "Babel" as the screen says, or "Tou no Babel" as it's usually referred to in Japanese. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a game in which you move around little pieces of staircases and try to get to the exit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This first level is actually more difficult than it looks; it involves a little trick of climbing over one staircase and then grabbing it from the other end (something that's actually not immediately obvious when you're playing this game). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Various little bonus items will appear from time to time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game was developed by Namco, and it's [reasonably] long. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There are 64 levels altogether, and (as you can imagine) they get quite difficult by the end. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game falls into a category that I tend to call "Sokoban"-type games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Sokoban" is an earlier Japanese Computer Puzzle Game, and it seems to have inspired a lot of, sort of, similar ideas such as this one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As a rule, "Sokoban"-type games usually involve moving around some sort of blocks or similar objects, trying to clear passages, and, uh, move things around. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And usually there's some kind of, uh, physical obstructions that keep you from moving anywhere. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like in this case, it's, for example, well, gravity is, sort of, an obstruction as well as, uh, the various stairways and vines. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And there's usually some sort of rule as to how you can or cannot move things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In "Sokoban" itself, you can push but not pull cartons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this particular... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (I -- I died there; you cannot, uh, jump off a ledge while holding a block because it'll crush you.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this [particular] game, you can [only climb up] the stairs from one direction. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In this level, there's actually that sort of, uh, little monster face there that you have to get rid of by touching the light switch. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So you need to first build a staircase to the light switch, and then, uh, after that's taken care of, you can exit the little hole there when the monster face disappears. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game does eventually, uh, bring in moving enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, there's no timer on this, but you do have Power. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Basically, your Power goes down when e... -- every time you lift a block, so you [only] have a finite number of lifts. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the first, uh, level with {a} moving enemy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, I've made a terrible mistake there, and there's really no way to avoid him once he gets you in a corner like that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can crush an enemy by dropping a block on his head. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We'll try that the second time here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing about the later levels is these levels we're looking at here basically all exist simply on one screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The later levels are much longer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, you can never see the entire thing on one screen, so this makes it kind of difficult because you won't always know what's above or below you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Therefore, you, sort of, have to, uh, move around the screen, plan your course of action, and (once you've, sort of, explored the whole thing) then try to figure out how to get through; [you will] probably lose [a couple] lives doing this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, here's a good example right here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I saw if I could drop a staircase down there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, unfortunately, when I go down to see what's at -- what's down below there, I find there's nothing but a bunch of spikes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is one of those where the solution is [sort] of hidden in plain sight. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, if you're a fan of Puzzle Games like this, I'd certainly recommend giving this a try. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But {it} looks pretty nice, probably more engaging than "Flappy", which is an earlier "Sokoban"-type Puzzle Game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, we'll see a couple more of these things {a} little {bit} later on [in] the episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Volleyball 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 July 21 🇯🇵 // 1987 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo | Pax Softnica
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the fourth release for the Nintendo FamiCom Disk System, "Volleyball", published by Nintendo themselves. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though this is one of those unusual instances where they actually used an, uh, outside developer, a company called Pax Softnica. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They would become almost like a second-party developer for Nintendo; and made quite a few games, such as, uh, well, "Mother" is one of the most well-known ones. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, you select either the Easy mode, the Training mode, or the Real Game mode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You also choose whether you wanna play the female or the male version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 With the female teams, the ball moves a little bit slower, so it's a little easier. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When your team members go red, that means they're activated, and those are the team members that you're moving when you use your D-Pad. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Basically, it selects the team members closest to the ball. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a reasonably cute little game; Nintendo seems to, sort of, be following a pattern here of releasing, sort of, major games, alternating with games like this that probably didn't take as long to develop [and] perhaps, uh, well, a lot of them are actually Sports titles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They actually have another big game coming up later this episode, which we'll be seeing very soon. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} not a real big fan of this game: it kinda reminds me of Nintendo "Tennis" - just on a slightly larger scale. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah, here's the screen where ya select your gender and which team you want to be. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The team selection will determine the difficulty of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Volleyball" definitely takes some getting used to. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In order to do well at all outside of the Training mode, you'll have to learn how to spike the ball. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This requires having one person, sort of, toss it up in the air, another person run beneath it, jump up, and then spike it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is actually, uh, a bit trickier than it sounds. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I was, sort of, practicing for a little, [but] never really got the hang [of it] very good. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, note that in the actual Game modes (as opposed to Training modes), the other team will spike the ball almost all the time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Ah! Ya see it right there.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it's actually, uh, quite difficult to defend against the spike, simply because it comes down so fast. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I've never really mastered this game... or didn't even really [come] close, {to} tell ya the truth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's, uh, not that bad on the Training Mode, but get to the actual Game Mode with, like, a more difficult team, and you'll find yourselves pretty much constantly being hit with spikes. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh -- And the [only] way you're really gonna be able to score points against the other team is by learning how to master the spike yourself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, you'll really need to practice at this game if you wanna have any fun at it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ganbare Goemon! Karakuri Douchuu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 July 30 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once again, we have a new title from Konami. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And just like "...Goonies", this one is also an original created especially for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is "Ganbare Goemon!...". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is probably not familiar to most folks in the West, but this is actually the first game in a long-running series by Konami. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 'Ganbare Goemon!...' games have been released on many systems, the most recent being the Nintendo DS. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The Goemon character in this game is actually based on a historical person, Ishikawa Goemon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He was a 16th-century Japanese thief, supposedly a sort of Robin Hood-like character. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He was apparently executed by being boiled alive in hot oil, and Japan has a kind of bathtub (a goemonburo) named after him. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The first game in this series is actually an Arcade game called "Mr. Goemon". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was a side-scrolling Beat-'em-Up, as you can see here (very little like this game on the FamiCom). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [only] title to re... -- bl... -- be released in the West is "Legend of Mystical Ninja", which is a reworking of the first 'Goemon' game for the Super FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Since the first "Ganbare Goemon!..." game was never released in the U.S., we'll take a look at an unofficial English translation to make things a little easier. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 What sort of game is this? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess you might say it's a side-scrolling Platform Game combined with elements of "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Each level consists of several interconnected, uh, streets. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes they take place in [the] cities; sometimes they take place outdoors. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I've just found a, uh, hidden passage there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's numerous, uh, hidden passages concealed in every level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Finding these passages is very important because they always have very helpful items concealed in them - for example, the pass. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You actually need to collect three of these passes to complete the level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, every level contains a shop which you can use to enter a special maze. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There'll always be one pass, as well as some, uh, bonus points hidden in the maze. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These are first-person mazes, but luckily they're not too annoying, and you can find a map somewhere in the maze without too much difficulty. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! There is the map right there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This first maze is actually quite simple. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once you've found the pass, you wanna go ahead; make sure you didn't miss any bonus items and head on out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, if you can't find all the passes, you can buy them in shops. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can also buy other helpful items, such as armor, healing items, all kinds of things in the shops. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, you can definitely see this game owes a certain amount to "...Zelda", such (it is) as the shops to go in to buy items {and} the fact that you're always collecting money. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this case, you collect money by jumping over or near the various little pots scattered around the level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The enemies don't drop any money. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Other things you can find in the pots or, uh, items that will sort of speed you up and the little, uh, lucky cap thing will allow you to have a slingshot, as opposed to your standard-issue weapon, which is a pipe. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll encounter various enemies throughout the game; policemen, thieves, samurais, ninjas (of course), and even Japanese demons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I've got my three passes, so now I head to the end of the level, and I'm off to the next level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, I've got to celebrate by spreading money among the common people first. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, the historical Goemon was supposedly a Robin Hood type guy who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This guy doesn't actually rob anybody; he mostly just finds money laying around in the streets. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Some of {the} levels here actually involve a bit more platforming type stuff, like this one has, uh, falling rocks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Ah! There's another hidden passage.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can buy candles, which will allow you to find the hidden passages easier but, of course, the candles are quite expensive. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (There's a healing item.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The platforming elements in this game are very light. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The sea levels don't actually involve any platforming at all. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [the] levels that do have some platforming are usually pretty simple. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Probably the most annoying are levels which take place at sea. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There'll always be some point where ya have to jump over a bunch of little islands. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Here's one of the sea levels, right here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a little bonus item - a, uh, Konami Easter Island-style head, there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Most of the challenge of this game is avoiding the enemies and making sure you find all the necessary items before the timer runs out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The levels aren't usually too large. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 At most, usually, uh, the early ones are around 2, 3, 4 levels high and then, you know, a number of screens across. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here's some of the island hopping I was talking about. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You] can't really control how far you jump, so you, sort of, have to gauge the jumps very, very carefully. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this game is pretty interesting in, like, a "...Zelda"-light / "Super Mario Bros."-light kind of style. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The later games in this series were quite different! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They actually started developing a very unusual sense of humor and became, uh, much stranger. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you've ever played, uh, "Legend of the Mystical Ninja", you'll know what I mean. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Regardless, the first "Ganbare Goemon!..." game is still pretty interesting. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Solomon no Kage 🇯🇵 // Solomon's Key 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 July 30 🇯🇵 // 1987 July [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tecmo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, right away on this game, we see the title screen violates Nintendo U.S.A.'s prohibition of religious symbols. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a Star of David clearly seen there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Yes, this is "Solomon no Kage", a port of [Tecmo]'s 1986 Arcade game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was still a relatively recent game when the FamiCom version came out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I believe the Arcade version was a... pretty reasonable hit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This thing was ported to many, many systems. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, it's actually quite nice looking; take a look at those dragons in the background there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Just like [Tecmo]'s "Mighty Bomb Jack", this game was eventually released in the West as well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, the FamiCom version can't quite live up to the Arcade version, but it's still a -- a reasonably fun game to play. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, the object here is apparently, you're this little wizard fellow who is invading the actual tomb of Solomon himself in order to obtain Solomon's key. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have to find your way through (uh, is it 64 or 65 levels?). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Each one you have to find a key which will open up the door, and then you must escape without being killed by any of the enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's also countless little hidden things here, as well as a bell on every level that you can collect. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you hit that, a little fairy will come out, and collecting that fairy will give you a fireball. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Since you don't normally have any, sort of, offensive weapons, the fireball is quite useful. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 How you actually get around is the sort of, uh, tan color or brownish, red-orangish blocks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Those can be destroyed using your magic wand. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can also use your magic wand to create blocks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Thus, you can, sort of, create little, uh, stepladders {and} destroy blocks that are in your way. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The gray blocks are mostly indestructible, but occasionally there are, sort of, secret gray blocks that can be destroyed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you progress through the levels, the enemies, uh, get consistently more and more difficult, and you have {to} be quite clever to avoid them and to make your way to the key without being killed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, I've, sort of, accidentally trapped myself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, I sort of actually could have gotten out of that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, here I'll try a, uh, slightly, uh, better attempt at getting through this level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game almost reminds me a little bit of "Sokoban"-type games in the sense that you're, sort of... well, rather than moving blocks around, you're destroying them and creating them, but the idea is, sort of, similar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But I suppose that really the game this resembles most is "Lode Runner". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Instead of digging little holes, you can d... -- uh, destroy blocks [that] your enemies can, uh, fall into. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, like "Lode Runner", this game is hard! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, you can jump up one space; that makes the game a bit easier. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These first few levels are pretty simple, but the game actually ramps up in difficulty pretty quickly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And when it comes right down to it, "Solomon's Key" is actually a pretty difficult game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, if you have the patience to get through these "Lode Runner" type games, you actually, uh, might enjoy this one quite a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For folks who don't like these Puzzle-type Games, you'll probably be pulling your hair out pretty quickly on this one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Namida no Soukoban Special 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 July 30 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ASCII
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the third and final Puzzle Game we'll be seeing this episode is "Sokoban" itself - or rather, "Namida no Soukoban Special" (which means something along the lines of 'Tears of the Sokoban Special'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 'Sokoban', itself actually means something like 'shopkeeper' or 'warehouse worker'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 'Special', here, is intended to indicate that this is a, uh, updated version of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Please note, this is a FamiCom Disk System game coming out just one week after "Volleyball". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That must certainly be a first for the F.D.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Furthermore, this is actually the first non-Nintendo F.D.S. title; this was released by ASCII. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I suppose this game is something of a turning point for the F.D.S.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 After this, games would be released on a regular basis by all kinds of publishers, as opposed [to] just one Nintendo title coming out every month. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There will actually be a lot of F.D... -- F.D.S. games released during the rest of the year, uh, probably about two dozen or so, at least. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, how do ya actually play this game? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, basically, there's a series of, uh, single-screen levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You play the little guy who works in the warehouse who pushes around the packages or the boxes or whatever you wanna call those things. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You can actually hit the Select button to get a better view of the screen, as opposed to the excruciatingly small screen that is the default. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the object is to get all the, uh, boxes lined up on those little dots. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can push a box, but you can't pull it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, it's quite easy to get yourself trapped. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, occasionally, you'll hit a -- like, a -- like, a special item (like I just got a magnet a moment ago). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Earlier, I believe I picked up what might be a ball of thread. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These can be used one time and give you some sort of special ability (like the magnet will pull a box towards you). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The thread (or whatever it is) will actually allow you to grab a hold of a box and move it around in different directions. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, there's, sort of, a, uh, timer; there's a score which constantly goes down the longer you play. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, if you're thinking, 'Hey, wait a second! I can just put the game on pause and then examine the playing field and figure out how to do it.', well, no, you can't. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hitting the Start button will actually, uh, quit the game... or rather quit the level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 With "Namida no Soukoban Special" I suppose if you like these kind of games (you like these little Puzzle Games that involve moving something around), you'll probably like this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's reasonably fun, reasonably addictive. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There's quite a few levels; I'm not sure exactly how many, but, uh, more than enough to keep you occupied for quite some time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, Puzzle Game fans should take a look at this one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Valkyrie no Bouken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 August 01 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The first release in August is "Valkyrie no Bouken". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The full title of this in English would be 'Valkyrie's Adventure: The Legend of the Key of Time'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is one of the few games that asks you to enter in your zodiac sign and blood type. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Valkyrie no Bouken" is, sort of, intriguing because this is perhaps the very first obvious "...Zelda" clone. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Remember that "...Zelda" had come out in February; this game was released in August. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, while this game does take a lot of elements from "...Zelda", it also borrows a lot from R.P.G.s, even American, uh, Computer R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, what I'm going to do here is, sort of, break down the ways this game takes items from "...Zelda" and the way that it takes item from existing FamiCom or Japanese R.P.G.s and sort of, compare and contrast. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is actually, sort of, midway between "...Zelda" and an R.P.G. like "Hydlide". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 First of all, you roam the overworld occasionally running [into] dungeons, uh, just like "...Zelda" - or "Hydlide", for that matter. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you can find, uh, scattered throughout the world, uh, more powerful swords, weaponry, that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Just like in "...Zelda", you have healing items, including red and blue healing items. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That thing, by the way, (that little beaker) is actually a poison antidote. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And just like "...Zelda", this game revolves around some sort of magical MacGuffin, called the 'Key of Time'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Apparently, the main villain [of] this game actually came [out] of a giant grandfather clock, and you've gotta use the key of time to put him back in because he's terrorizing the land. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And like "...Zelda" this game has no dialog boxes at all. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The combat system in this game is very much like "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Monsters appear as you move into an area, and you use your button to swing your sword and hit them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Ah, there's a Health Potion I received right there.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, the combat is quite a bit more difficult than in "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your weapons don't have any sort of ranged attack, and the monsters tend to appear surrounding you completely and then converge upon you pretty quickly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is especially annoying when monsters, uh, shoot fireballs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Whereas in "...Zelda" you are usually able to dispatch monsters one at a time: here, they tend to gang up on you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In addition to the "...Zelda"-like elements, this game also has a few things that people who [have] played "Dragon Quest" or "Hydlide" might find somewhat familiar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, it has Inns and Shops. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There you have the inn, which I'm entering right now. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is a little unusual in the sense that you can Level Up [only] while resting in bed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can get Experience Points and then, once you hop into the inn, uh, heal yourself, and rest, you will then, uh, Level Up. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you saw there, this game does have Experience Points, Hit Points, and Magic Points, much like "Hydlide" and "Dragon Quest" and most R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, you'll find that this game has treasure chests. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And much like 'Dragon Quest', you will sometimes need a key to open them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another R.P.G.-esque s... -- feature is that you can sometimes make extra cash by finding items in treasure chests and then selling them at the Shop. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, if you go to the far left, you can, uh, choose an item to sell. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, I bought a Long Sword; now, I'm selling my Short Sword. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And a lot of the items can actually be found, both in Shops and hidden in [treasure] -- treasure chests as well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Valkyrie no Bouken..." also has a continent-style world, much like "Dragon Quest". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "...Zelda", where you can get to the final castle, uh -- or the final dungeon as soon as you start the game if you really want to, you cannot immediately access the continent where the main villain lives. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to, uh, find a ship and the whale in order to, uh, get there, which takes some -- some time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But overall, the plot to this game is very similar to "...Zelda", "Hydlide", and "Dragon Quest". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You need to mostly roam around, fight monsters, build experience, and then occasionally find some sort of item, which is necessary to proceed further in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another R.P.G.-esque thing that was not found in "...Zelda" but is found in this game is the use of Magic. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have both Offensive and Healing spells. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, you can throw fireballs; you can also cast Heal on yourself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the Heal spell is not nearly as effective as you would hope. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, despite all these ideas being borrowed from existing games, "Valkyrie no Bouken..." does introduce a few new things -- these things that were not found in "...Zelda" or in earlier console R.P.G.s - for example, the boat. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Later 'Dragon Quest' games would lead a -- would l... -- uh, use a ship, but there was certainly nothing like this in the first one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "...Zelda" had a little raft, but you couldn't really use that to explore around the ocean freely like you can in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Something that would find its way into 'Final Fantasy' [games] was tents that would restore both your health and your magic. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, these tend to be very rare in the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can't just stock up on tents like you can in "Final Fantasy". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Something else that would turn up in 'Final Fantasy' and later 'Dragon Quest' games was negative character statuses that last beyond, uh, just the battle that you're fighting. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this game, you can actually be poisoned - both by enemies and by touching things like cactuses. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You need to use the, uh, Poison Antidote in order to cure this; otherwise, your Health will very quickly drain away. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, negative statuses become a very big factor in later R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you just saw there, there are little warp gates around the world [that] you can use as, kind of, shortcuts. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, later 'Dragon Quest' games would have something very similar. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another -- Another way that "Valkyrie..." differs from "...Zelda" and prior R.P.G.s, uh, was the fact [that] there's absolutely no hints whatsoever in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, there's absolutely no dialogue. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's hardly any text at all. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But at no point will you run into any little helpful N.P.C.s that'll give you, uh, helpful hints as to where you're going. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's really no N.P.C.s at all, other than the guys you see running the Shops. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And this leads into my next point, which is this game is needlessly difficult and frustrating. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I certainly wasn't able to finish this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I was able to finish "Hydlide", amazingly enough, but this game proved too much even for me. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I Leveled Up quite a bit but still found myself being killed when I actually tried to enter a dungeon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Much of the problem seems to be the lack of balance between how much damage you can take and how much you can heal yourself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The monsters in here seem to do about one-fifth of your Life Bar every time you get hit by a fireball. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your Healing spell can restore about one-fifth of your Life Bar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, it uses so much magic you can [only] use it three times. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, the Healing Potions [only] restore a tiny bit of your life. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Because inventory space is so limited (you can [only] carry eight items), you really aren't able to stock up on Healing Potions before you enter a dungeon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Whereas "...Zelda" would have monsters that would sometimes drop hearts or even fairies and "Hydlide" you were able to generate your health by standing still, there's nothing like it in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When you enter a dungeon, you really are going to have to, uh, basically simply avoid being hit by monsters (difficult when they're sending all those fireballs at you). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Furthermore, unlike "...Zelda", "Hydlide", and "Dragon Quest", there's no way to completely heal up for free. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can stay in an inn, but it's absurdly expensive by, uh, console R.P.G. standards. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In "Dragon Quest", killing one or two monsters would usually generate enough Gold to stay in an Inn. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this game, it costs you around one Gold piece to generate one unit of Health, and you usually (well, at this point, I think I have around 130, uh, Hit Points, so far). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most of the monsters [only] drop between 1 and 10 Gold pieces when you kill them (let's say an average of around five). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, a lot of times, you'll go into battle, get beat up, and come out with [only] around maybe 50 or 60 Gold pieces. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I often found myself with not enough Gold to actually heal up completely, much less buy better items at Shops. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess the [only] way to play this game is to either keep Leveling Up until ya get even into the first dungeon or simply become so good at avoiding enemy fireballs that you can, uh, fight monsters without taking any damage. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Either way, I was not really having much luck at this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess I'm gonna have to say the lack of balance in this game makes it pretty much unplayable, aside from just being boring. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, this game was a big hit in Japan and spawned several sequels, which are better than this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess in the long run, this game is a lot like "Hydlide". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 While it's very fascinating to look at the game and chart, sort of, the progress of console R.P.G.s, it's not much fun to actually play it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Metroid 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 August 06 🇯🇵 // 1987 August [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our last game this episode is the big, big one: "Metroid". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this game starts off with some of the best ever music for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I have to admit the Japanese title screen is probably a bit cooler than the Western one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you can save your game too! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the Western version for the N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It uses passwords rather than a game save. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 For those [of you who've] never played "Metroid", it is one of the great games of the 8-bit Nintendo. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's basically a side-scrolling Platformer; you run, jump, {and} shoot enemies, but there is a sense of exploration, as per "...Zelda". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The plot of "Metroid" is actually quite similar to the movie, "Aliens". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You play Samus Aran, a "Space Hunter" whose job it is -- is to beam down to this strange planet and wipe out a race of dangerous aliens called Metroids. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One of the first things you'll notice when you start playing the game is you'll probably run into a dead-end pretty quickly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In order to get past that wall, you'll need to obtain the first power-up in the game, which is actually found to the immediate left of where you started. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This, sort of, sets up the basic, uh, pattern of the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You explore until you can't anymore, and then you need to find some way of getting past the various barriers that keep you from getting further. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the game structure is somewhat similar to "...Zelda" in the sense of needing to find special items in order to complete the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This first power-up here will allow you to transform yourself into a little ball and roll underneath various obstacles, like that very first one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 After you've taken care of this, you'll still find that various doors are locked. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In order to get past them, you'll need to find the Missiles and actually blow the doors up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Blue doors can be opened by a single shot with your blaster, but red doors require five Missiles in order to open them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, you need to find Health Tanks that increase your maximum Hit Points as well as the better weapons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, some of the weapons, such as the Ice Beam, actually serve a dual purpose. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Not [only] are they useful against enemies but you'll n... -- actually need 'em to get to certain parts in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Still, like pretty much all interesting video games, "Metroid" did have some predecessors. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like, for example, this game seems very similar to the old Atari 2600 "Pitfall II..." game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like "Metroid", "Pitfall II..." had both horizontal and vertical scrolling and had a huge cavern to explore. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, there were some items to collect like the mountain lion, Quickclaw, that you could see early on {in} the game, but you couldn't get to [until] much later. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Metroid" takes these ideas much further than "Pitfall II...", but the basic ideas were already present in "Pitfall II...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, this game was really not that old; it was released in 1984, [only] two years before "Metroid". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Still, when "Metroid" came out, the vertical scrolling did seem pretty novel at the time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have these, sort of, very long, tall vertical corridors that you have to go up and down. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was almost, sort of, like taking "Super Mario Bros." and adding an extra dimension to it - that of height, as well as distance. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, "Metroid" has no real stages; it's more or less one continuous, seamless whole. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Thus, "Metroid" (more than "Super Mario Bros.") ...it gives you the feeling [that] you're actually, sort of, exploring an actual concrete developed world. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There are several different sections in "Metroid", which are actually accessed using elevators. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But these don't really feel like discrete levels because you do have to go back and forth between different sections all the time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another thing that "Metroid" utilized quite a bit (um, just like "...Zelda") was the idea of backtracking. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, from "...Zelda" we have the idea that there's countless secrets to be found in the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you obtain the bombs, you're able to bomb your way through hidden passages in floors and walls. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some of these are necessary to progress in the game, whereas others are simply shortcuts. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Much of the time spent playing "Metroid" will be spent wandering around this world, looking for ways to get past the various obstacles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Despite the fact [that] there is a lot of exploration involved, "Metroid" isn't really a nonlinear game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You do have to accomplish things in a certain order in order to make any progress. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Like right now, for example, I'm looking to get the High Jump Boots. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This will allow me to jump a little bit further up and, therefore access areas I couldn't have earlier. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Until I've, uh, got these boots, there are other important objects that I can't get - and a lot of areas that I can't actually get to. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Metroid" actually does impose a certain sort of linearity upon the player, though it often doesn't really feel that way when you're playing it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Metroid" actually does require you to be pretty clever when going around this place. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It is pretty large, and it's very easy to get lost. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And a lot of the secret passages are really not that easy to find. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, I'm bombing my way through a shortcut to a new area. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Super Mario Bros." and "...Zelda", "Metroid" is not a Shigeru Miyamoto game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was actually designed by Gunpei Yokoi, the legendary Nintendo employee who also designed the Game Boy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The co-designer of the game was a younger designer named Yoshio Sakamoto. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sakamoto is probably the real creative force behind the "Metroid" games, and he would actually design most of the later "Metroid" games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And "Metroid" definitely is a well-designed game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The color scheme is great, considering the FamiCom's limited color palette. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A lot of games seem to have, sort of, ugly garish color schemes, but definitely not "Metroid". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I think the, uh, sort of pure black background actually does help a lot. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, unlike most prior Nintendo games, the character of Samus is, sort of, designed in a more or less realistic proportion. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Samus, sort of, looks and moves like a real human being, as opposed to, uh, the short stubby characters of '...Mario...' and "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Metroid is really one of the earlier attempts on the FamiCom to, sort of, portray a human being in a semi-realistic fashion. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the music by Hip Tanaka is superb throughout. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another great thing about the game is that, even though you have to get items in order to proceed, there really aren't any generic, like quest-type items like keys. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Everything you obtain has an actual purpose to it (other than just unlocking the door). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Missiles will help you get through doors, but they're also very good for fighting enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These aren't things you just, sort of, use once then never have to worry about again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, here we're coming up to the first boss, and he's actually quite simple; you can, sort of, stand right in front of him, sort of, blast away, using either your Missiles or your regular gun. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have to defeat two sub-Bosses, Ridley and Kraid, and then you can move on to the last level and fight the main boss, the Mother Brain. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've defeated Ridley, you actually get a much higher Rocket storage capacity, so there is actually an advantage obtained by defeating the bosses. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I can now carry up to 99 Rockets, which is quite helpful, [because] some of these purple doors actually take 10 Rockets to open. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And some of the tougher enemies will actually take several Rockets to be killed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, again, this game does have a certain debt to "...Zelda" with your main goal [to], sort of, find the boss and kill them - and your goal before that to be, sort of, to get an... -- powerful enough to actually stand a chance of defeating the boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In "Metroid", this is mostly done by collecting Health Containers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can get up to, I believe (well, um, in this case, I have about 500 Health Points), and I can now hold 200 Rockets. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So I'm now ready to take on the actual Metroids, themselves, which are found on, sort of, the last relatively short level of the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These final few passages here are actually the most difficult in the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Metroids are a bit tricky; you have to use your Ice Beam to freeze them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you can blow them up with the Rockets if you want, but that probably just really wastes Rockets. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's better probably to simply freeze 'em and then jump over them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Finally, after dodging lots of lasers and the little red fire circles, you'll meet the Mother Brain, herself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 She doesn't actually fire at you, but it is difficult to find a place to stand and get a shot at her. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have to fire Missiles at her until she explodes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But those little fire rings and lasers make, uh, life pretty difficult for you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If I do have one complaint about "Metroid", it's the fact that when you get knocked off into a pool of lava, it's actually very difficult to jump out, for some reason. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Almost every single time I die in this is game, it's because I've been -- fallen into a pool of lava. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you fall into that little pit of lava right in front of Mother Brain, you're pretty much doomed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, I'm now firing off the last few shots, and, uh, Mother Brain is about ready to blow up here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But! There's an additional little touch; you have to now get out... of the base before it explodes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a timer going off, and you have to, sort of, jump up a bunch of little, uh, difficult-to-navigate, uh, platforms and get out safely. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And "Metroid" may be one of the very first games to offer multiple endings. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Depending on how fast you finish the game, will depend on which ending you get. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you get through the game in a reasonable amount of time, Samus will remove the helmet and reveal that she is, in fact, a woman! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, if you complete the game very, very quickly, she'll actually strip down to, sort of, like, a bikini. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is an interesting idea (using sex to reward a gamer for, uh, good gameplay - certainly not the last time this would be done). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the whole idea that this -- your character was actually a female was, sort of, like, the -- the big surprise ending at the time (though, of course, nowadays, it's comm[only] known). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, if you play through the game again, you'll play Samus - but this time in, sort of, like, a leotard suit - as opposed to her actual spacesuit. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once you finish the game, you get a rather lengthy, uh, credits (again with a lot of uh, strange pseudonyms used for the programmers). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, what was the overall legacy of "Metroid"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, it helped popularize Science-Fiction themes in Platformers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Most Platformers at this point had, sort of, been, uh, having cute little Fantasy or Historical Japanese themes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It helped popularize the concepts of, sort of, a free-roaming world, backtracking, and a certain amount of non-linearity. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And really nothing in "Metroid" was new, per se, but this game certainly took all these elements together and packaged them in a *very* appealing way. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once again, "Metroid" - one of the all-time great games for the FamiCom! 🍇🍌
