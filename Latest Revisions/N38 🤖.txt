👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 38 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This episode we inch closer and closer to the end of 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've now reached December. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what's in this episode? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How about the massive enormous "Chrontendo 1988 Computer Game Round-Up", our quick run through the highlights of the Year in computer gaming. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Besides that, we have (drumroll please) Japanese Adventure Games, Military Strategy Games, Board Games, the usual stuff, and an action classic from Tecmo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Mahjong II: Shanghai he no Michi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nihon Bussan 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright folks, let's make This one brief "Family Mahjong" to. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh my goodness, another Mahjong game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What a surprise. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namco is original "Family Mahjong" came out back in August '87. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one has some fancy new options. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually like the neon option menu. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a railer old play a game of Mahjong option, as well as Mahjong tournament, and now Mahjong Grand Prix. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have options to turn on or off the various rules in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can also turn off the background music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this looks just like every other Mahjong game we've ever seen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll point out this is a one-on-one version of Mahjong, as opposed to the standard for player Mahjong. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It appears this game was felt by Nihan Busson, a.k.a. Nichibutsu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They were actually well-known for making a lot of Mahjong Arcade Games at this point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Grand Prix mode has a face off against this series of opponents. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You actually have steps in this mode (for example, luck, stamina) and there's a menu to buy or sell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the influence of R.P.G. is in crept into Mahjong games at this point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally they find room to squeeze in some cheerleaders here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've seen quite a few of Namco Stanley Sports Games so far, but the series seems to be petering out for the time being. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might be happy to know that there is not gonna be a "Family Mahjong III". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jaaman Tanteidan - Matonarikumi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, it's the first F.D.S. game this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is one of those games where the very first thing you see is the instructions to flip the disk. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the device that gave us "...Zelda" and "Metroid" and "Castlevania", now gives us gentlemen Tinto, Hayden Martin boomi from Bandai, (a.k.a. the sequel to omo ecurie temptation how to glue me which we saw back in "...Episode 29"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Wait a second', you say, 'I can't remember Oh Curie 10 paid and how to me?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it was based on an '80s Toei T.V. show, and was from the mind of shotaro ishino Maureen, who is basically like the Japanese Sid and Marty Krofft. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The show it was a bunch of kids running around trying to catch some sort of a serious mask, master thief. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Jesus, where are these kids, parents? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, Mom, I want to go out and find this guy who runs around town wearing a Gold mask and a cape. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, Sunny be back by dinnertime. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's like letting your kids spend the night at Michael Jackson's house. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So after a few minutes of loading screens and menus, the game starts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it turns out to be one of these games, this, sort of, top-down Adventure Game where you run around town interacting with N.P.C.s using various objects. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you have a little command menu and you get some special items to use. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, I give a lot of s--- to Japanese Adventure Game to the "Portopia" mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there was also this sub-genre, the top-down Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've seen a few of these like kid a Princess Imagineer back in the six, which looks just like this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or there was Sunsoft some, you know, common series, a bit more action in them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or Qian cheesy to that Chinese vampire game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are all titles which are, sort of, like Adventure Games, [only] the top-down format. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Generally you spend a lot of time running around town talking to people. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's kind of like those fetch quests and R.P.G. that takes place entirely inside a village. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to run around, like get an item, and give it to someone else. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like a whole game of that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this game, you can switch between various team members, all of which have different inventories. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't really know what all these items do, but doesn't look real exciting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The back of this game seems almost completely forgotten in Japan, so it must be [pretty] obscure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know if there's anything about this game that recommends pursuing it any further. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Chuugoku Senseijutsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Aicom | Sanritsu 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm really sorry folks, but the worthless crap is just not going to stop this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, to Goku sensei Tutsi, a weird little title from Jaleco, apparently developed by a calm, but sound rich whose name is also in there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what exactly is to cocoa since they do to. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why it's Chinese astrology. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is not a game but rather, sort of, a fortune telling simulation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this wise old guy with the gigantic eyebrows are going to tell you your fortune. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start by entering your name and date of birth, and the game can take up to 10 different individuals information. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you've done that the cartridge will peer into your future and give you some valuable info. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For entertainment purposes. This is done using little cutscenes and whatnot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's take a look at marriage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm going to guess this is not good. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'd be concerned but I didn't actually enter in my real birth date. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is apparently someone else's fortune. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is your fortune for professional prospects. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All kinds of interesting stuff can be learned here like your lucky numbers, Lucky foods. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe you remember a similar NGS game called taboo designed by Rare. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is, sort of, the same idea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Putting this in video game form seems, sort of, unnecessary. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I guess if you want to get your fortune read, you don't want to read it a boring book or something mopping this card instead. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kaettekita Mario Bros. 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here's an oddity that you might be interested in "kind of Mario Bros." (or "the return of Mario Bros."), a somewhat rare and very strange variation on "Mario Bros." released on the FamiCom Disk System writer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note the copyright to nega tawnya. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who are they? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, this cutscene might just explain a few things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! it's an ad for another tenean Fried Rice Seasoning. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And after this, you get to play good old-fashioned "Mario Bros." game we covered way back in "Chrontendo Episode 1" for those with bad memories. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was the port of the Arcade Game, which was the 'Mario' game that appeared in between "Donkey Kong Jr." and "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So why was this particular variation made? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know, Nintendo and nakatani, and had been doing various promotions together for a while. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Check out this ad for nakatani Enza Mario printers peach branded silicone cards and seasonings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This cutscene seems to be promoting the ohtsuki Nori rice soup seasoning. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was their flagship product, I suppose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The thing was, there have actually been some subtle changes made to the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mario himself handles differently. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 His jumps are, sort of, more in the modern "Super Mario Bros." fashion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the turtle sprites have also been changed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original N.E.S. "mario bros." had these oddly shaped turtles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One brand new thing is this weird little minigames in a slot machine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can play this to win extra lives. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Was that the "Final Fantasy" music? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously this was never released outside of Japan, but a game called "Mario Bros. classic" was released in Europe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was based off this version, not the older "mario bros." that came out Japan and the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, was missing all the cutscenes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, this is officially the strangest 'Mario' game yet. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Anticipation 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's anticipation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's an undated U.S.-[only] game from November 1988. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is this aimed at adults? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, look at the imagery. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Read kissy lips, the kind of shoes that are normally referred to as fuck meals, a phallic looking trumpet, and a rather suggestively spilled ice cream cone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Throw in a class a black, white and gray logo and you have what appears to be, sort of, a naughty game for grownups. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, this game was designed by Rare. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Rare has never had a problem with having a big gap in appearances in reality. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just check out any of the titles and covers to any other old Computer Games and you'll see what I mean. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They are masters of misdirection. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anticipation is like a Western [only] release from Nintendo designed for the U.S. market. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's a board video game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But not anything like all those Japanese game lifestyle games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, it's more like a Pictionary type game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is a board and most of the action takes place on the draw screens where the computer starts writing something, any to guess what it is, using a setup suspiciously familiar to Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, use the D-Pad to sculpt the word. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you get it right, they'll move forward on the board the number of spaces shown on the die. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the idea of trying to guess what the computer is drawing is it's an interesting idea, but it doesn't really work perfectly in practice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What's this, for example? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Carpet, Moran some sort of beetle? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Computer knows. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I see; it's a space invader. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, anyone could have guessed that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first player to get the answer right, we'll get the color of the square that was landed on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoever gets all four colors moves up a level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, much like the enormously popular tool pursuit cane, the object is not going to get ahead of the other players on the board. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's to land on the right colors and get the answers correct. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anticipation is basically Trivial Pursuit cross with Pictionary. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On Level 2, the puzzles are a little different. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They don't show the dots, nor the number of letters in the word making it trickier (for human players at least, but not for the CPU). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What the heck is this going to be? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the C.P.U. recognized as a fire extinguisher (something no human could guess based on what was drawn). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, the answer was actually 'extinguisher'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you tried typing in 'fire extinguisher', you have been wrong. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what are these? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll go marks obviously. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But when you get to the A we all know that wrong so I guess are just quotes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And why is this in the office category anyway? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here's another example of a C.P.U. opponent having psychic powers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, it somehow figures out that was a cassette tape? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally anticipates and can be played for up to four human players, but similar problems will arise. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a limited number of pitchers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, several repeated during the one game I played. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So someone has played before is gonna have a very distinct advantage over someone playing it for the first time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If I play this again and the cassette came up, I be able to guess it well before anyone else. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually will reach the final level and collect all four colors and then you win. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then your avatar ascends up into Heaven and encounters a grizzly winner's trophy featuring the corpses of their opponents. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually No, I guess that's not what it is because you're on the trophy too. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just a weird trophy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the screen will freeze and you stay here forever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing ever else happens after you win. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we do see a certain consistency and Rare's work. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The board is presented in Rare's beloved isometric perspective. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And anticipation greatly resembles the releases for GameTek. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I hope you like Rare because they're going to respond like literally every other U.S.-[only] game released in 1989. designing games for Nintendo Acclaim GameTek LJN. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 American NDS games will be dominated by Rare and 89. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Alien Syndrome 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 02 🇯🇵 // 1989 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega | Sanritsu 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 // Tengen 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 December 1980 At last, and our first game is "Alien Syndrome". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] cool action packed opening here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As a [pretty] scary looking alien. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Yep, it's another Sega game published for the FamiCom by Sunsoft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like Panther zone, which we saw a while back. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know how or why Sega is licensing its gains to Sunsoft or at least on the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe they want to piss off Nintendo? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1989, Sega allowed Tengen to publish the game in the U.S. as an unlicensed cartridge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So yeah, maybe so. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, aliens syndrome is a top-down Action Game, sort of, in the Run-'n'-Gun style. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's [pretty] typical for the time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object gets find all the hostages on a level and then get to the exit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Originally, Sega released alien syndrome in arcades in 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not a bad little game, but certainly Sega is most memorable already. title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it was certainly look kind of low tech compared some of the other stuff Sega is releasing an '87. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we've already seen the Masters some version of alien syndrome published by Sega themselves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Game was changed quite a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now use "...Zelda"-style flip screens and aliens just, sort of, materialized out of nowhere we enter a room. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was [pretty] annoying because it would often appear right where you're standing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In comparison, Sunsoft downconversion was much more successful recreating the original. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The flip screen through gone and the game now smoothly scrolls as you move around on a level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also the aliens on first of all, now match the arcades vision all those weird little blob things. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can find number of weapons and cubbyholes age level such as a [pretty] decent plan thriller. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And one to rescue all the comrades on a level it's time to go to the exit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you make to the exit where the timer runs out, you'll find a boss (who incidentally also has a timer). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, they're all of the sword I shoot the lead, Scott That occasionally appears variety. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they all have like a weird design. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like what's this guy supposed to be exactly? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Afterwards his head will detach and fly around. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everything in the game seem to, sort of, inspired or ripped off from at least Scott's alien movie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is true not [only] in the in these appearances but more explicitly so in some of the cover art for different versions of this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the second level brings on the enemies that look just like the zero more from the movies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the fact that they, sort of, walk around with their wagging their tails makes them seem kinda like cute little puppy dog. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it, sort of, detracts from their fierceness. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can find a few different weapons from this game, the laser or the flame thrower was a grenade launcher or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing too exciting though. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the fact that each level is just, sort of, the same idea (Basically, just running around a maze-like series of rooms) makes the game, sort of, repetitive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the positive side, there's a rather ominous creepy music, which gives the game, sort of, a nerd of wracking atmosphere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The fact that there's like the sheer number of aliens is, sort of, overwhelming. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It almost makes it like an early survival horror game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't have limited ammo, but the screen can very quickly fill up with responding enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you often have like, sort of, run around the aliens; you can always shoot them all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So alien cinema, sort of, like dead space zero. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not a bad game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's certainly better than the master version. (Amazingly enough as that is). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But still it's a decent part of a socio Arcade Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And really aliens and there is not to the level. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Totsuzen! Macho Man 🇯🇵 // Amagon 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 02 🇯🇵 // 1989 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Aicom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by VIC TOKAI 🇯🇵 // Sammy 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we have a new one from VIC TOKAI, the oddly named Susan macho man, a game that revolves around you transforming from a little runt into an enormous nearly nude body doll. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Welcome to crazy Island. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This actually got to us released by Sammy under the main ama God. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Man, I should dig that logo with the eyes and fangs on the Oh. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not sure why Amazon was flying a Red Baron sell biplanar or an early 20th century bathing suit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Island is not crazy in the U.S. version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the goal is to get to that boat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And look, there it is in the background. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Doesn't even look that far away. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Swimming might make more sense than crossing the island. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is another Japanese game so normally harmless creatures will kill you with one touch birds, spiders, mushrooms, mosquitoes, frogs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All are extremely dangerous here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know what the Japanese game spot is. But according to the U.S. releases manual, Amazon is the world's most decorated Marine, which seems unlikely considering his fragility. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the box art depicts him as some goofy looking kid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He It looks too young to be handling that rifle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what the hell, sort of, name is ama gone anyway. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Marines in video games have names like Bill or Lance or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Where his parents, hippies or Lord of the Rings fans or something? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object aside from shooting everything and not getting killed is to grab those power-ups that add to your points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Get enough points and you'll be able to turn into mega gone a more modular version of Amazon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, you need to also find the mega key, which has a little graphic of mega gun on it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, there's [only] one or two specific enemies in the level that actually dropped the menu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you don't find it, you'll be kind of screwed when you reach the boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hitting select will transform you into a gun if possible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The little bars the top center will show your life. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each time you take a hit, they'll take off one bar. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also have a cool way of being but it uses up again one bar each time you fire it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When all your bars are gone and transformed back. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bosses are easy as may be gone, but take tons of hits while you're in regular form. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, did I mention your ammo is limited, and if you run out, you're screwed? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now I like Amazon's bright cartoony graphics and the game looks [pretty] simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing that's not obvious watching Amazon be played by someone else is just how brutally hard it is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's usually not a lot of enemies on screen at once, but they tend to lay traps for you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The wasps, for example, will pile projectiles at you and you can't really jump over through them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If one fires its projectiles right in front of you, you're [pretty] much dead. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game loves having enemies rush towards you very quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like here, the spider just zooms towards you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or here this snake shoots projectiles right when you kill them sometimes, and they're just too fast to avoid. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But perhaps the worst are the birds they tend to fly across the screen incredibly fast right as you're jumping. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can't control yourself in mid-jump. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So often you'll jump and then Blam a bird immediately smacks right into your mid-jump. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it seems kind of like a memorization base game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the exact timing and number and position at certain Emmys seems kind of random. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you can't just memorize specifically when to jump. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And these kinds of sudden deaths occur over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's infuriating! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Right now I'm also in playing a "Ninja Gaiden" for this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And let me tell you how the first half of "Ninja Gaiden" is a piece of cake compared to the first part of Amazon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sure, "Ninja Gaiden" has numerous respawning enemies and flying enemies and that sort of thing, but they just don't move this fast. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like "Ghosts 'n Goblins" [only] the enemies consumed across the screen in a split second. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But look at this, how could I possibly have avoided that bird? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To the constant cheap deaths the limited ammo and the fact that the bosses are [pretty] much impossible if you're not mating on forums, make Amazon not very well remembered today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most people seem to dislike Like it does have a few defenders. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original version seems to be an early example of the Japanese fixation on campy bodybuilder games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other examples being Of course, the 'Cho Enki' games, or the we are titled "M.U.S.C.L.E." March. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. version, he had no explanation whatsoever about how or why anagon turns into mega Don. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can't say Amazon is good, but it has potential. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the way it all fits, it's one of those challenging areas and repeated instant deaths make Amazon not very fun. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 The Amazing Chrontendo 1988 Computer Game Round-Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 1988 is almost over. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But one more thing we've got to get out of the way is the 1988 Computer Game Round-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like we did back in '87. We're going to take a whirlwind tour of the Computer Game scene in 1988, Covering the best or biggest or most interesting games or the most representative games of that year. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We can't come close to mentioning every great game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So of your all time favorite 1988 Computer Game is not here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sorry. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# A Bit of Background… ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A bit of background for you younger folks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the mid-'80s, the computer market was divided up among several types of machines, all of which were completely incompatible with each other. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the old guard by this time was on its way out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Apple II was a decade-old by this point, and the enormously popular Commodore 64 was also [pretty] ancient. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Game still came out for these things, but they were virtually obsolete by 1988. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Newer high-tech machines were available for those with deep pockets, such as the Commodore Amiga, and the suspiciously similar Atari ST, which was released after jack de Mille, (formerly of Commodore) bought Atari Corporation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There was also Apple's Macintosh with its futuristic graphic interface. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But at this time, the Mac was merely an ugly looking toy for the rich, rather than the computing behemoth that it is today. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Across the ocean They were still stuck with the likes of the ZX Spectrum and the Amstrad - extremely affordable and popular machines that made the Commodore 64 like high-tech by comparison. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But by 1988, it was clear that a winner had emerged in the home computer wars, the x86 based IBM clone, generally running DOS. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A fancy new VGA graphics standard had recently been introduced. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we'll see a [pretty] big jump in the graphic capabilities in 1988. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Chapter 1: The Old Guard: Adventure & Strategy Games ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A number of changes are going to be in store for Computer Games in the next few years. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But let's start by looking on some of the older genres, Adventure Games and Strategy Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the last couple of years, the graphical Adventure Game had been dominated by Sierra. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was still true in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But changes were afoot. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Gold Rush ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Gold Rush, designed by Ken and Doug McNeil, (who had also worked on the King's Quest games) was one of the very last games using the old AGI engine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not really that different than -- from King's Quest and the way that it looks replays. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's, sort of, like King's Quest set during 1949 Golden rush. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For whatever reason Gold rush is almost completely forgotten today. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸King's Quest IV ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is big game of the year was probably King's Quest for, the latest in their flagship series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And introduce here is new game engine STI a.k.a. Sierra's crib interpreter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This meant higher resolution graphics, better sound, and mouse support. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 King's Quest for is a bit of a departure in terms of your character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You now play Rosella (King Graham's daughter). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the gameplay is basically the same, including of course, lots of opportunities for death or unwinnable games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And once again, the game relies heavily on European fairy tales for subject matter. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Leisure Suit Larry II ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another very different sequel was aloes, leaders who Larry goes looking for love in several wrong places. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was a step up technologically for the first game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again single, Larry roams around Los Angeles, and later ends up on a cruise ship. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The sexual humor seems toned down quite a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is no hookers biting off your penis in this one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game's cruelty has perhaps been dialed down a bit as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are far fewer sudden deaths. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Manhunter: New York ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Completely different from the typical Sierra game was man Hunter, New York, produced by the three Murray brothers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sets of brothers seem [pretty] common at Sierra. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This bizarre dystopian Sci-Fi Adventure Game, wasn't you unusual that used a point-and-click sell system rather than text input. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It also dumped the typical flip screens for an overall map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is sending a [pretty] accurate version of New York. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a bit of an overlooked gym, though it does have the typical seer awkward action sequences and surprise deaths. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like here, don't look at his face. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh good lord! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No idea what that means. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Zak McKracken And The Alien Mindbenders ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the flip side, Lucasfilm Games (as LucasArts was called back then) released its follow-up to "Maniac Mansion", Zack McCracken and the alien mindbenders. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's very similar to "mansion" (right down to the cutscenes) and even the casual animal cruelty. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can put your pet Goldfish in the garbage disposal if you wish. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, rather than taking place at just one location is around the world via commercial jet airliners. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Money is also brought into play as need to buy airline tickets and various items. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As in "Maniac Mansion", you switch between characters at certain points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But unlike that game, there aren't multiple solutions based on which character you're playing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's, sort of, a step back in a way. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Dream Zone ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But CRM hear in Lucas Films weren't the [only] folks making graphical Adventure Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Lots of guns. As we're. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Including some new faces, such as jam software and their game dream zone. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Damn, those are some ugly digitized graphics! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But did you notice the names on the title screen? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! jam software would tune change their name to Naughty Dog, and eventually find payment fortune with Crash Bandicoot, Jackson Daxter, and Uncharted. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is a rather an auspicious beginning. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Manhole ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Likewise, the manhole was the first game from a Scion and random Robin Miller. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Originally released for the Macintosh and quit using hypercard, man who was a surreal Adventure Game aimed at kids. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the Amiga version, by the way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later, the Millers would release another hypercard game for the Mac called mist, which would go on to be one of the biggest selling Computer Games ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And playing manhole it almost feels kind of like a goofy prototype for missed. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Zork Zero ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now by this time graphical and point-and-click Adventure Games have squeezed out the older style Text Adventure Games (sometimes known as interactive fiction). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To see how the once mighty had fallen look no further than the Zorka 0 (1 of the very last games from infocomm, which had been releasing huge sellers like Zork and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in the first half of the 1980s). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By 1988, they'd been acquired by Activision and infocomm was finally shuttered in 1989. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though Activision continues to use the name from time to time. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Decisive Battles of the American Civil War Vol. 1 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from Adventure Game, the other predominant genre, early days of Computer Games was the Strategy Game, specifically the Military Strategy Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And an '88 these old-fashioned hex games were still around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One major title was decisive battles of the American Civil War, Volume One from SSG, who are still around today making Military Strategy Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most of these things have been completely forgotten today, look through old issues of Computer Gaming World and you'll be amazed at how popular they once were. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Red Storm Rising ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still more modern variations were springing up all the time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, "red storm rising", based on the Tom Clancy novel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems like [pretty] much every Tom Clancy novel has been turned to a video game at some point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the games made by SSG, "redstorm rising" has an evolved plot slick interfaces, fancy graphics, cutscenes - all the sorts of cutting-edge stuff you would expect in early 1988. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸President Elect: 1988 Edition ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, not all Strategy Games were military themed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nope. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Take SSIS President Elect 1988 edition - update of an old Apple II game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The interfaces and graphics are [pretty] minimal. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I realized now that United States presidential election game that when we saw on "Chrontendo Episode 37" was very much in the style of this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though naturally being a Computer Game. Just about everything about your candidate or election is customizable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can select a plane election from any number of years. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But still, it's not exactly much to look at. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Hidden Agenda: A Post-Revolutionary Game ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which is definitely not the case for this game, hidden agenda from trans fiction. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another game originally created for the Mac using hypercard, hidden agenda is a Central American government Simulation Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the DOS version, but you can definitely see its Macintosh origins with the crisp black and white graphics. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You played your country's new president, do things like pick a cabinet set policy, engage in diplomacy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's definitely unique game for its time and its style and easy-to-use interface make it reasonably playable today. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Laser Squad ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Moving in another direction, we have these stupidly named laser squad, a turn-based action Strategy Game with a Sci-Fi theme built by target Games and published by blade software. Originally for the ZX Spectrum. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the Commodores 64 version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though far prettier versions came out for DOS and the Amiga later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You select a squadron of soldiers to infiltrate a series of buildings occupied by enemy forces. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If this greatly resembles x com U.F.O. defense, and that's because it was designed by the same people. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Laser squat is basically XCOM zero. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Battlehawks: 1942 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much like Military Simulation Games, Flight Simulators have, sort of, fallen out of favor in recent years, but they were quite popular in the '80s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here's a big one battle hawks "1942" a very technical historically accurate game, and the first flight Simulation Game from Lucasfilm. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Battle hawks spawned two popular sequels, their finest hour and secret weapons of the loot vava. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game was designed by Othello named Lawrence Holland, who later went on to create a little game you might have heard of called x wing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, this right here is the whole beginning of the LucasArts flight simulation. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Chapter 2: An Unfair Competition: Action & "Arcade" Games ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Throughout the '80s, P.C. games faced competition from two sources, Arcade Games and console games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was certainly true in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So action based games formed a big chunk of game publishers catalogs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Confusingly referred to as Arcade Games at the time. Many of these play like Nintendo games but with worse controls. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Impossible Mission II ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 1984 is impossible mission was a huge hit. So naturally, Epyx released a sequel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the Amiga version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You run around a series of buildings looking to computers and various objects for passwords and avoiding the killer robots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He also tried to avoid falling to your death which is not always easy because of your weird and awkward jump. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually sort resembles the Master System game bazillion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Odd lay the success of this and there are other games didn't prevent Epyx from declaring bankruptcy in 1989. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Obliterator ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now compare impossible missions. too ugly graphics to those of obliterator. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you'll see why psygnosis was so legendary at the time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Limit typically beautiful looking intro here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And great music from David Whittaker. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, do you remember another diagnosis game for the 1987 Computer Game Round-Up called barbarian? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is basically barbarian in space. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's designed by the same guys who did barbarian and has the same god awful controls team where you use the mouse to press buttons along the bottom of the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is actually, sort of, common problem with diagnosis their games look great, but are a pain to play. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Exile ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 180 degrees in the other direction we have exile, which is a [pretty] unimpressive looking game that uses a sophisticated physics engine. And the huge open ended world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sort of, resembles a Computer version of "Metroid" cross with the old FamiCom game "Astro Robo SASA" which has a similar usage of momentum and gravity. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Originally designed for the obscure burgers computer the Acorn Electron. This is the Commodore 64 version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And is a classic example of the, sort of, British technical ingenuity overcoming the system's limitations. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Inside Outing // Devon Aire: The Hidden Diamond Caper ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Speaking of British game designers, they were still putting out these isometric Platformers in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one is called inside outing or the adventures of Devin air designed by a little company called soft tech and published by Epyx in the United States. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one looks [pretty] nice and the Commodore version has decent music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess "Sabre Wulf" and all those other games just made an indelible mark in the U.K. game industry. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Armalyte // Delta II ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shoot-'em-Ups were obviously [pretty] big Arcade at the time, so naturally, computers had them as well. Mostly terrible ones. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one was [pretty] popular. ArmaLite a.k.a. Delta two. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is obviously a "Gradius" robot and seems barely played Today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But yet it got really good reviews when it came out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least it has the typical funky C64. Music. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Menace ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much prettier is minnis. Again published by psygnosis, but developed by DMA Design. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right The famous Scottish developer named after a psychedelic drug. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe this was their first published game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Say [pretty] blatant, "R-Type" of clone, but at least it has a really trippy looking graphics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 DNA, of course, went on develop such huge hit as lemmings and the Grand Theft Auto series, eventually being purchased by Rockstar having their name changed to Rockstar North. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the ad This is [pretty] typical bio warfare. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You're being attacked by sperm. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Savage ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh God, what's this savage built by probe? Who responsible for tons of material gain conversions, and later were sucked up by Acclaim. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They ended up putting lots of games the Genesis and other consoles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Was published by Firebird in the U.K. and microprose of all people in the United States. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This sorta thing was considered hot s--- in the world of Commodore 64 games in 1988. as amazing as that seems today. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Captain Blood ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A bit more interesting as Captain blood with music by New Age superstar john Michel Jarre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it really seems that a slice to track from one of his albums. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Published by the French company infogrames, who later bought Atari, Captain blood is not a pirate game, but a weird Sci-Fi game with some super trippy visuals, and lots of speech samples and some alien language. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And apparently, these 3D style landscapes were created using fractals, so this seems [pretty] cutting-edge. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Contra ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing I haven't discussed yet his ports of games for other systems. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember that many big Arcade hits cannot for computers In really terrible versions, like the Commodore 64 contract. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the absolutely horrible controls actually make it harder than other versions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's fun. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸R-Type ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For "R-Type". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Guy, his response for this conversion really screwed up the music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe conversions were generally [pretty] good and the Japanese sharp 16,000 had really good versions of Arcade Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But almost anything else you saw on other computers at this time was certainly [pretty] awful. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Chapter 3: New Routes: Successes & Failures in Innovation ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The late '80s was a time of much transition in the world of Computer Games as old genres begin mutating or dying out, and new genres emerged. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As technology improved and competition from the consoles increased, new ideas emerged. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some succeeded and some failed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One idea that took off in a huge way was Sports Games, which licensed name of popular athletes or athletic associations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Electronic Arts was rapidly becoming the dominant figure in Sports Games IE licensing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But other companies such as E.A. is Bay Area neighbors accolade also got in on the act. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 JACK Nicklaus, his greatest 18 holes of major championship Golf, was the first jack Nicklaus Golf Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Damn, that's some suntan jack. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mechanically speaking, this worked much like all the other console Golf Games we've been seeing with a Power Meter, it couldn't have a lot more options. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Developed by the Utah based company sculptured software, the game received many sequels becoming one of accolades flagship series. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Jordan vs. Bird: One on One ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, the granddaddy of licensed Sports Games was a one-on-one Basketball Game from 1983. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1980, the release to see cool Jordan vs. Bird one-on-one, with Dr. J being replaced by Michael Jordan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] simple half court Basketball Game, but the updated graphics allow for some [pretty] impressive digitized imagery of Jordan Byrd on the title screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And He even went through all the trouble to create a whole Bunch of unique spectators in the stands. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not just a bunch of circles representing faces. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This got poured into a few consoles but without the Nike logo in the background. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸John Madden Football ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But one-on-one is small beans compared to this game, john madden football, one of the cornerstones of E.A. is Empire. By far the most sophisticated Football Game created at this point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Practically every aspect was customizable, even down to the weather conditions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game had considerable input from mad at himself, and took around four years to make. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 EA hired Bethesda later of Elder Scrolls name to work on it based on but this does Football Game gridiron. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, the first version was for the Apple II, but this year is a das release. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Three Stooges ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, not all ideas work out so well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sim aware was developing an idea for interactive movie games. One of the earliest Being The Three Stooges. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Granted, The Three Stooges looks nice, but when you play it you see it's a slow moving Board Game with lots of dole minigames thrown in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Similar was previously known for the great defender of the throne game, but they started moving in the direction of less interactive games, eventually going into FMV games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Three Stooges doesn't seem that interesting today, but it got a lot of press and magazines like Computer Gaming World and was seen as a top tier title and, sort of, a step towards the future of gaming. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸War in Middle Earth ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Speaking of dole games, we have another great looking Amiga game this time from Melbourne house, a.k.a. Beam Software, who had previously released The Hobbit perhaps the best selling computer Adventure Game of all time, accepting maybe missed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Melbourne house and beam product is very hit and miss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And with the war Middle Earth, they seem to aim for an odd combination of Adventure Game R.P.G. and Military Strategy Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It didn't really pan out and we were left with Probably the [only] Strategy Game that's padded out with lots and lots of scenes people walking down the road before he can get to any actual battles. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Lane Mastodon vs. the Blubbermen ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Infocomm as seen earlier while on their last legs by 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They tried to branch out from Text Adventures to something else called info comics. Sort of a simple choose your adventure type electronic comic books. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Only] a few invoke comics games were actually released including this one lane mastodon versus the blubber Minh, which is actually a leather goddesses of Phobos spin-off. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game seems to consider itself some sort of revolutionary new form of media. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The big innovation being you can switch the character you are following at certain pre-selected points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This branching pads and the storyline is the [only] hint of interactivity. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the story is an art or just to doled make an impression and these were designed by Tom Snyder productions, who's actually still around today as a big producer of educational software. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'd say this is probably as close as Western game design ever got to the, sort of, style of like Japanese Visual Novels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One innovation that did end up taking off in the biggest way possible was more technological. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 1988 was a major turning point for 3D games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We already saw how there are a few polygon based 3D Racing Games in arcades in 1988. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Carrier Command ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we saw a couple early 3D titles and the 1987 Computer Game round-up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But now we really see the concept taking off with games like carrier command. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 From real-time game software. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is technically used wireframe graphics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's a weird battleship simulation slash Strategy Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the 3D objects and environments were extremely impressive at his time. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Dark Side ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another British 3D specialist was the horribly named incentive software. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Dark side which is, sort of, the sequel to their earlier game driller. Use the cutting-edge first-person 3D game engine free Escape, which allowed for the creation of three environments, which you could move through freely. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess you might call this were like a very early First-Person Shooter. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Total Eclipse ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Incented follow this up with total eclipse, which was an Egyptian themed game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you know, sure this doesn't [only] look like much today, but it was [pretty] unbelievable back in 1988, even though it runs at like five frames per second. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, you can sense the changes in the air. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once games could do this. There was really no turning back. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Starglider 2 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A bit more fascinating is this game star glider two, develop my Argonaut games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first star glider game used old-fashioned vector graphics, but the sequel introduced flat shaded polygons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So basic fly around and shoot stuff game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wildly praised upon release. I find the controls awkward, but it's still [pretty] impressive looking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As for Argonaut, they ended up working for Nintendo and helped design the super epic Next chip ustun Starfox and other games before later moving on to create various crappy license games like Catwoman the game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Colony ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the most well remembered of these early 3D games was the colony originally for the Macintosh. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's one of those games involves running around an almost empty spaceship. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jus a lot of the tension for a mat game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was later ported other systems such as this full color Amiga version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while the mouse controls are, sort of, clunky, the colony definitely does have the cleanest looking real-time 3D environments we've seen so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was published by MindScape, who also published info coms, Mack pincher games, and nowadays least a lot of crap. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Tetris ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, all of these games are obscure and forgotten compared to this one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Tetris" reached us shores in 1988, apparently debuting at the 1988 Consumer Electronics Show. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No other sources say it was released in '87, or even a Six. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, we'll definitely encounter "Tetris" in 'Chrontendo'. Again, in the context of the spectacular Tengen versus Nintendo battle over the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing I can say about this version of the strange control scheme will really throw you for a loop if you're used to playing on the D-Pad. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Chapter 4: The Golden Age: R.P.G.s at the End of the '80s ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from Adventure Games, if there's one Computer Game genre of this era that people still remember today, it's the Role Playing Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 1988 is smack dab in the middle of the Golden Age of R.P.G.s, and the era produced many memorable titles. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The most anticipated game of the year was undoubtedly Ultima five. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It had been three years since the groundbreaking Ultima four was released. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So fans of the series were definitely very anxious to see what Richard Garriott was going to offer up next. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ultimate five was huge eight discs and included this lengthy introduction. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was an ambitious game with heavy themes, much like Ultima four. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Back, it's technically a sequel to Ultima four, and clearly use the same engine more or less. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's somewhat surprising that origin was still developing these things for the Apple II. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While the game is a huge, vast epic, the mechanics seem, sort of, old-fashioned and even clunky at times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They still have the classic ultimate freestyle battles, and you have to pick up every single piece of treasures separately after winning a battle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this game, the series was modernized a bit, with ultimate six getting a huge upgrade to dos. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Might and Magic: Book Two ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another big sequel was New World miton magic to excuse me might magic book to the sequel to the 1985 game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 My magic was a [pretty] advanced R.P.G. full of lots of N.P.C.s and side quests. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The sequel has much improved graphics. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we are rolling the die. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's hardcore. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is very much Dungeons and Dragons inspired with tons of character creation. Options, complicated controls, big dungeons, a huge open world, and a Dural vagueness about what exactly you're supposed to be doing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Battles are in the first-person viewpoint and their turn-based. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wait a second, what are sewer rats doing in a forest anyway? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Battles can be brutal and unfair. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can in theory face up to 255 enemies at once. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like look at this 250 of these things. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom [mentioned, not seen] ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 1988 saw lots of sequels such as "Wizardry V", which was still very old fashion but finally introduced car graphics. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate [mentioned, not seen] ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or Bard's Tale three from interplay. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Mars Saga ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some new faces did appear whoever such as Mara saga, the first game from Westwood Studios, who later went on to produce the eye of the beholder, Dune, and the Command and Conquer games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] typical R.P.G. with First-Person mazes and random battles fought on top-down action segments. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Battletech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps more ambitious, Was Westwoods battletech, the crescent hawks Inception published by infocomm and dig that awesome P.C. music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was based on a series of non-Computer Games and was probably a lot more complicated than Mar saga. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This also had a top-down overruled almost like a Nintendo game and involved mechs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It almost, sort of, resembles very primitive version of xeno gears. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Wasteland ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, there are two R.P.G.s that are probably the best remembered today. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First off is wasteland from interplay, published by Electronic Arts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As post-apocalyptic game used a top-down overall and turn-based battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] standard, but wasteland was perhaps the first R.P.G. to use skillpoints, which you could assign to various abilities. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is of course, comm[only] found in many R.P.G.s today, and wasteland serves as the inspiration for an even more so this R.P.G. from interplay called fire. out. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Pool of Radiance ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, we finish with one of the most beloved Computer Games of the era pool of Radiance from SSI, which stood apart from the crowd by being an official advanced dungeon the dragons computer R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, rather than just being inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, this was a real dungeon, the dragons game, specifically a Forgotten Realms based game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully someone out there geekier than I can explain what exactly that means. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your characters are highly customizable, and you can even change their appearance on the battlefield, something I neglected to do Unfortunately. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The plot is basically read the Kingdom of evil. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The story is simple compared to something like Ultima five, but the SSI Gold box games became, sort of, like the definitive examples of 1980s computer R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And will eventually see Nintendo version later in 'Chrontendo'. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Conclusion: 1988 Computer Games Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there we have it, the good, the bad, Classic, the forgotten. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully this little 1988 Computer Game around-up helps everyone to see how strange and wild and varied the Computer Game scene was at this time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So in a way now let's get back to the FamiCom. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hanjuku Hero 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bits Laboratory 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Square 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's start by stating the obvious here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On juku has some [pretty] good music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, that's our homeboy Nobu. Matsu providing the soundtrack. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When the game starts up, you have options of three campaigns. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On Dooku hero (or soft boiled hero) is one of the game from the time period where Square was transitioned. To releasing "Final Fantasy" themed games exclusively, (at least in Japan). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And even this one is clearly "Final Fantasy" inspired him like so many other square games that period has an alliterative title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hell, even the overall looks like take him straight up "Final Fantasy". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yet Han Juco heroes more of a prototypical strategy R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are all enemy castles and you see enemy troops walking around on the overworld. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's your capsule. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Inside you'll find the main character, Lord on the moon, and what I presume are two generals of some sort. Zeus Nina's. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing like mixing up Greek and Roman mythology. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You select the character you want to move and then we want to travel to (anime castle perhaps). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then the troops walk very, very slowly to their destination. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is the real-time part in real-time strategy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Often you'll encounter these events where character or characters appear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you may have gathered, by the sequences on Juco hero is a comedic goofy game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The sequel, a superfan, macom game even parodies "Final Fantasy" characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Among other things, these sequences are where you can spend Gold and poop better units. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other times you'll have little gambling minigames. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and the Joker is always walking in a straight line. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you'll swim across the ocean rather than using the nearby bridge. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you reach a castle with enemy units, a battle will occur. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there's really not much here in terms of tactical combat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The two sides just pound each other until one wins. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No player input required for this kind of battle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this game was described as an early Real-Time Strategy Game, which it, sort of, is I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It might be inspired by a Computer Game that came out earlier in the year called Hertzog. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It sequel here talks by is somewhat well-known in the West. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the first game was, sort of, the Grand Father of the Japanese Real-Time Strategy Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On juku hero has some of the same ideas like buying units rather than building them. And even uses the same red and blue color scheme for the two different sides. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the hum juicer is most notable element is the egg monsters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are a couple of special tasks that can be used in battle, including hatching an egg monster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Guys do a little dance around the egg. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then it hatches into a suspiciously full grown monster, which more often than not, can whip the s--- out of the other side. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I assume this was the inspiration for summit in the later 'Final Fantasy' games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 According to look at PDI The series was created by Takeshi Nikita, later known as the designer for "Final Fantasy IV" and the Co-Director for cloud trigger. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it appears that he was actually [only] a part time employee at square at this time and [only] get the graphics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The actual director was kazuhiko A op, an early square employee. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the programming was outsourced to Bits Laboratory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To catch it. Akita later became the main creative force behind the series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But apparently he did not actually create this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's an interesting but rather simple strategy R.P.G. type game. One that seems [pretty] simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, it's definitely a switch from the typical Strategy Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Momotaro Dentetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, it's rolled buddies Hudson. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Never ceases to surprise me that Hudson still have the time and desire to crank out FamiCom games, even as they are so focused on supporting the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In late 1980s. They're still the main producer of games for that platform. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ironic then that one of their most powerful The longest-lasting series started here on the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Momotaro didn't tend to is a train game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Number that the Japanese have a thing for one Board Games and two trains. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The two are combined in 1985 with take the a train from arting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Momotaro dentetsu continues this fine provision. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It works, sort of, like monopoly it will die some of your trains around try to make money. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now you might be saying wait a minute, the name Momotaro dentetsu. Sounds very familiar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, what you're remembering is this game "Momotarou Densetsu", which was out about a year earlier. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a straightforward 'Dragon Quest'-style R.P.G. from Hudson. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Momotaro dentetsu is a nutty take off on the original title. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, moment harden setsu is based on the legend of Momotaro the legendary Japanese folk hero who is born out of a peach. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Momotaro didn't set Densetsu means legend of Momotaro whereas Momotaro dentetsu means Momotaro Electric Railway. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One striking thing, however, is just how little Momotaro himself actually seems to appear in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On a purely visual level, this doesn't really look any different from any of the earlier train games like tetsu. Oh, what we covered back in "Chrontendo ... 26". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mostly, it's just you moving your crane around trying to make lots of money as far as I can tell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've also moved via ship at times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And release to various sequels every so often. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the series did take off and there's a good 20 games for various console so far. With the series more or less move into portable platforms in the more recent years. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It became one of Hudson's major properties along with "Bomberman" and 10 guy Mako. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're even tie-ins with actual Japanese railway lines. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the cool thing is the series is still handled by Kiran Kumar, the original creator. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why this game doesn't really look like much, it would eventually blossom into a very popular series. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 King of Kings 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 09 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atlus 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, we're one week into the middle of December 1988 and smack in the middle of the Japanese holiday shopping season. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the releases are coming [pretty] fast and furious. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last six games this episode all came out on the same day December 9. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First up is the strangely named King of Kings from Namco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is, of course, no relation to the unlicensed colored greens game King of Kings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the title doesn't really make too much sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing about Kindle canes it's actually [pretty] interesting because like a fantasy thing Military Simulation Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I wouldn't call like a strategy R.P.G. or anything but it does seem what kind of Like a distant ancestor names like fire emblem. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the moment though, let's call it Dyson yaku with elves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the campaign mode here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That fellow is the King, and he's the [only] one who can produce more units as long as in the castle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll start by making a fighter fit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As a standard human unit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each unit cost a set number of funds. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The more talent you conquer, the more resources you get. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it really works, I guess, a lot like bass in the APU or Balcombe wars. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing that's kind of unusual though, is the World Map is set on an open field like R.P.G. style, as opposed to the distinctly Mark Square's and most of these games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One new thing though, the King can make multiple units per turn, whereas in games like "FamiCom Wars", each base can [only] make one unit at a time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now aside from people you need to make non-human or magic creatures like harpies who can travel further and are [pretty] damaging. It's humans. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Their army little Trident pitchforks are something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like the similar games train will factor into battles which are carried out my quick little cutscenes just like "FamiCom Wars". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the stats are actually [pretty] helpful and detailed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now one thing King of Kings was developed by none other than Atlas, just like origami 10 say also for Namco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As overall it's a [pretty] well-made game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are some interesting similarities with atlases other work. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, your opponent in the campaign is, in fact, Lucifer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the fact that you can enlist things like harpies, goblins, dragons and golems does get kind of like a mega tin field. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One nice little touch and you can put a list of all your units with a single button press and it will show you which ones have moved. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can then select an unmoved unit and it will take you back to the map or that particular unit selected. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A very convenient way to manage your units as opposed to somebody moving the D-Pad all the place. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later levels, all kinds of different kinds of creatures are introduced. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're also a multi-player maps for up to four players. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bottom line King of Kings is a highly original and better than average Military Strategy. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Godzilla: King of the Monsters 🇯🇵 // Godzilla: Monster of Monsters 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 09 🇯🇵 // 1989 October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Compile 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toho 🇯🇵 // 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And now we have Godzilla monster of monsters, which is one really stupid subtitle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're gonna switch things up a bit here first by showing you the lane intro to the U.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] catchy music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they'll compare this to the intro to the original Japanese game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, this game was designed by Compile. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like the credits to a woody allen movie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So dramatic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoa, psycho way awesome or title string. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese always have cooler title screens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the music is completely different to. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This just says Godzilla or rather gojira. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the box art says Godzilla King of monsters, which makes more sense than monster monsters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So back to the U.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the animated intro that spells out the plot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Takes place in the year two xx, xX xX, wow, they couldn't narrow it down any further than 1000 years. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the game takes place sometime between 2000 and 2999. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why does this text move so slowly? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you read this slowly to base that you're basically illiterate. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, here's the summary. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Planet X, (bad guys from Godzilla versus monster zero) invade the solar system and take over all the planets. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, how can Kinga door fly in space? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ladies wouldn't work in a vacuum. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's going away ersten Godzilla and mothra to paint the whole space invasion thing, one planet at a time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We start off on Earth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I guess Earth has already been taken over because it certainly doesn't look anything like the earth that we know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And so this is what a Military Strategy Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's got a hex based map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But actually, no it isn't. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whereas King of Kings was a Military Tactics Game that didn't visibly divide the map and Square's or octagons or anything. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Godzilla King mom tours uses a Military Game layout for what is actually a beat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You select either Godzilla or mothra and move them around on the board. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even Get a side-scrolling segment where your selected monster moves across the map being up any monsters along the way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So either select Godzilla or mothra and then move around on the board. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you make your selection, you'll get like a little side-scrolling segment for your selected monster moving across the screen, beating up any monsters along the way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But as far as Beat-'em-Ups go, Godzilla is really weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see, your monster is huge, so big that it's impossible to wait in the attacks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can jump and punch. Despite this, you are going to get hit a lot, at least when you're playing as Godzilla. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main objective of each world is to move both monsters one step at a time to the thing that looks like a radar dish. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will teleport you to the next planet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now for each space to move, we'll have to pass through one short to Beat-'em-Up level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Godzilla in the two spaces per turn and mothra for. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When using mothra, the game becomes quite a bit different than when using Godzilla. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's almost like a Shoot-'em-Up. If you can imagine a Shoot-'em-Up using a really gigantic ship with a very limited range of motion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's like an invisible line about two thirds of the screen you can't move any higher than. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mothra has these weird bombing attacks where he drops what they call poison quills. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He has a lot less damage and Godzilla and he can take less damage, but he has much better maneuverability. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You often see other monsters hanging out in the World Map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you end up on the square. Next one, you'll find a boss battle like what goes on here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The thing is, when playing is mothra you do so little damage it takes forever to wear down the boss's health. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And because the battles are timed, it usually results in the draw. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess each monster has its strengths and weaknesses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Godzilla is really powerful, but he can do overwhelmed, there are too many things on screen shooting in at once. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mothra cantact from above, which makes certain enemies like these mushroom guys much easier. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everyone seems to think that Godzilla is a much better character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I actually died a couple times as Godzilla but never as mothra. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is seen as mothra you can just avoid more enemy attacks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 These levels can be kind of difficult or at least annoying because it's really hard to see what shooting at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The enemies are always these little gunports cannons and things that blend right into the background till you like can't see what shooting at you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, now we're moving on to Mars. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You want to click those red gems that occasionally pop out of enemies for rocks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They'll help restore your health. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also a bit of an R.P.G. element in here as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I'm sure you're not surprised. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will slowly Level Up as you progress the game getting longer Life Bars and a bit stronger. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Godzilla his best weapon is the radioactive Breath useful for sending out a whole bunch of things at once Oregon's bosses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It drains your Power Meter However, with refills very slowly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here you can see just how easy is take out this guy using his Godzilla gave mothra quite a bit of trouble actually. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well Godzilla is not a bad game. The graphics are good. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the gameplay is very unpolished. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your monsters are just so damn big and clunky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Levels are [pretty] repetitive. There's [only] a few different types. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the bosses are often just lame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Often they'll just stand there and let you weigh a lot more barely fighting back. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a very original idea for a game, but it's probably Compiles best. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tantei Jinguuji Saburo: Kiken na Ninin 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sakata SAS 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great another F.D.S. game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 10 paging suburu kijken nandina in the third game and Data East 10th aging Gucci's a bureau series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As before, developed by socata sH s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll be honest, we use plethora of Murder Mystery type Adventure Games is really starting to wear my nerves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How many more of these things can they release? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mystery solving detectives were like the bald Space Marines of Japanese games in the second half of the 1980s I guess. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, you control the oily haired Hard Boiled Detective suburu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one involves a motorcycle accident and a murder and switched up identities. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, so bureaucrats open the case by talking to a lot of people. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting, the first rule game from 1987 was on the FamiCom Disk System. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There was a second that was the Yokohama themed game that came out earlier in '88. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the second game got promoted to a cartridge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, now number three is back on the F.D.S. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then Data East has the gall to rip-off Nintendo's idea? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know how the FamiCom detective club F.D.S. game came out on two discs and the game was divided in half, one on the first disc and the rest on the second disc. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or the second being released about a month after the first. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Day, the East does that exact same thing here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The second disc arrived in February. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this didn't catch on though, because the fourth game had just a regular carpet release. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the way, if you want to play this game in English, you can. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first 310 taste of rural games were reworked for the Nintendo D.S. and came out the United States under the name of Jake hunter detective files. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now one historically noteworthy fact, the game was written by a fella called castle she got nojima. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He later moved on to square and became one of the main writers for "Final Fantasy", writing for numbers seven, eight and 10 as well as the Kingdom Hearts games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is his first writing credit. I'm aware of. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Any This never ending onslaught of Adventure Games ever going to cease? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably not anytime soon. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nakajima Satoru: F-1 Hero 🇯🇵 // Michael Andretti's World GP 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 09 🇯🇵 // 1990 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Varie 🇯🇵 // Sammy 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not the drama Jima Satoru f1 hero, the first game from Racing Game specialist vari. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh the game was developed our code adopted by human. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's not a very [pretty] title screen is it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess you are driving faster than a train. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kind of catchy music though. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 NACA Jima, Satoru was a real life Japanese f1 racer, so not really a particularly good one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He had a [pretty] short career apparently [only] been racing since 1987. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are naturally a few different modes, all of which we've seen before. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Warm up is a standard option where you play in one race. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can choose the track and car. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tracks are all based on real tracks. It seems. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The names of the racers in the cars have all been changed a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you have cars like Ferrari. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not the dealer will give you tips on the particular course that you're racing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There have been tons of f1 Racing Games for the FamiCom earliest It feels like they're having fun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They never get released in the U.S., except this one did as Michael Andretti his Grand Prix. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Michael Andretti is the son of Mario Andretti perhaps the most famous American racecar driver ever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ironically, Michael Andretti was not an f1 racer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He was an IndyCar racer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This version uses real car names, but slightly altered name for the racers themselves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here we go. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow, there's one tiny car. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, that was like the worst looking car sprite I've seen in a long time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, this is graphically one of the worst looking 3D style Racing Games on the family. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean "Pole Position" was better looking at that came out in 1982. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, everything is tiny because the map takes up half the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When playing is 2 Players, the top half is used by the other player. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Too bad they couldn't create like a separate graphical mode for single player. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Grand Prix mode has he racing a whole bunch of tracks and each race is long five laps in this case. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is [pretty] monotonous. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is [pretty] typical in some regards, like many Racing Games of the era, your tires, wear and tear and you have to replace them occasionally. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can see the meter for the tires in the lower right. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There aren't any R.P.G. elements like some of the other Racing Games we've seen lately. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are also no other drivers on the course. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have four gears but you start off in neutral. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we had to put the car in the first gear when you start otherwise we won't go anywhere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In an attempt at realism, you need to take the corners really slowly, and there are some hairpin turns that are [pretty] tricky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also tricky. The controls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The steering feels very digital somehow. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tapping left or right will change the angle by a certain number of degrees. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But unlike most Racing Games, you don't hold down on the D-Pad while turning. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Us tap once. And then you'd have the other way when you want to straighten out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The controls definitely take some getting used to and it's really easy to spin out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first time I played this, I thought, wow, this is like the worst Racing Game or with FamiCom ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I guess it's not really that bad. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you probably won't like the controls and it's, sort of, too monotonous. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some courses are literally like nine or 10 laps. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is probably not going to be your favorite N.E.S. Racing Game. 🍇🍌

👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We are nearing the end of yet another 'Chrontendo' but what's this NT no adventure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why it's another Japanese Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Array. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The origin of this game are, sort of, a serious. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the names and the copyright is Nanking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Nanking is a real person. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently so he's a comic artist. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though unlike every other Japanese manga artist in the universe, I couldn't find much about him online. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is one of the comic series he worked on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He seems to have, sort of, a weird cutesy style, not the typical manga stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game however, seems like every other such game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have such commands is look, inventory and talk and the menu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally spend a lot of time looking at everything and talking until a new menu option finally opens up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think I've said this before, but you could write a very simple computer program to play these games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You just need to go through the menus trying every single option until new options appear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once new options Stop appearing maybe move to another location then try again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No actual human intelligence is required to play these games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Man Keno adventure appears to be one of those deliberately wacky games pokes fun at Japanese culture. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Beyond that, I'm really not sure what it's about. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But really at this point, who cares? 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ninja Ryuukenden 🇯🇵 // Ninja Gaiden 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 09 🇯🇵 // 1989 March [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tecmo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, here's the big game this episode Tecmo's ninja Ryu kendon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, you and I know this game from its 1989 NDS release as "Ninja Gaiden". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It remembered today for two things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, there was this, sort of, thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right. superbly presented cinematic cutscenes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sure lots of games back then had fancy animated intros or little bits of story between levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But Tecmo went all out to gain lengthy animated cutscenes playing each of the games acts or levels that were full of dialogue and move the plot along. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the story was surprisingly ambitious for an Action Platformer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each cutscene is tied directly into the levels that surrounded. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The intro shows our hero Ryu Hayabusa heading to the U.S. to solve the mystery of his father's death. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then Level 1 begins with Rio on the streets at some major American city being attacked by goons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Throws the game carries on in this fashion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's action cutscene action cutscene. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We recently saw a bit from the Arcade Game ninja guide, a wacky Beat-'em-Up that was completely summarized by the animated intro which declares ninja in the U.S.A.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's exactly what it is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rio goes on a rampage to various locations beating up goons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much like Tecmo's rygar the home version is a completely different game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade Game was built by someone named strong shimo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whereas the FamiCom game was by Hideo Yoshizawa, who later made some [pretty] cool games at Namco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The two games were created simultaneously but independently and as a result are completely different in just about every way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese name means ninja Dragon Sword legend. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But was given the easier but still exotic sounding name of "Ninja Gaiden" in the U.S., or Ninja Gayden, as you may have called it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which is completely unfair. I mean, Ryu isn't gay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sure, he has no time for girls, but that's just because he's a cold blooded ninja who has no time for touchy feely stuff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Oh, okay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess he's just into the rugged outdoors height is all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, the second thing "Ninja Gaiden" is remembered for is the insane difficulty. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game is hard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And why are the power-ups in this level obtained from giant mosquitoes? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And why are you being attacked by linebackers? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and let's not forget that enemies instantly respond over and over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In a situation like this there's zero room for error. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thank God for the firewheel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It gives you immense ability but appears very Rarely in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each level has a boss at the end and these greatly vary in difficulty. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first two guys are [pretty] simple, but some of the later ones can be [pretty] darn hard. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now each of the six levels has a completely different setting and is a bit harder than the one before. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Difficulty ramps up from Level 2 being, sort of, tough to level six being virtually impossible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And let's not forget such hated enemies as the Eagles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like those "Castlevania" Medusa heads, they are hard-to-hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you don't kill They'll turn around and follow you and attacking you from behind. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they're almost always multiple types of enemies attacking you at the same time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game conspires to constantly wear down your help. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing I've noticed about Rio is he's not a very good ninja. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from getting killed by birds and football players, it's [pretty] easy to get the drop on him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just casually pull out a gun and shoot them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And once Rio gets the all important MacGuffin demons statue, some guy just waltzes in, grabs the statue, jumps up to the skylight, gives us a little speech. While Rio just stands there with his mouth hanging open. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What the? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Art ninjas supposed to be quick on their feet. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually real climbs a mountain and makes his way to the main bad guys layer in the most well-known cutscene from the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Certainly one of the most spectacular moments in the N.E.S. library. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then the plot thickens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The girl is kidnapped. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main bad guy appears. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah also the car involved. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then naturally we will get dropped out of a trapdoor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently absolutely everything takes you by surprise in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The final level is just pure unadulterated evil. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The developers really want you to die over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enemies stand on teeny tiny platforms over huge pits while flying ninjas dive bomb you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They really like to work out the timing so that when you get hit once you will freeze for a second and fall back and then take a second unavoidable hit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And come on look at this here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean two flying enemies attacking you at the same time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or two flying enemies and a guy throwing projectile that you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why, Tecmo, why? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean thankfully you have a secondary weapon system taken instead of "Castlevania". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But even so you always feel like you're out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At some ports the last level you're like a pinball getting tossed around by the bumpers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Such ridiculous. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And all this raises the question is "Ninja Gaiden" actually a great game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean sure the production values are great. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But is the game just too unfair to be enjoyable? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, developers really do rely a lot on repeated cheap deaths. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or they just padding the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Level design is very inspired and relies a bit too much on the old 'platforms over pit' setup. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is certainly lacks the creativity of say violent "Commando" or "Mega Man". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's a chain because parts of "Ninja Gaiden" a break fun and the game is certainly very visually striking in spots. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's an indie game plot twist which naturally takes Ryu completely by surprise. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 His his father isn't dead, just brainwashed by the bad guys. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then comes the fun part, a three part boss Rush. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And dying will take you all the way back to the beginning of level six. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those cranking up "Ninja Gaiden" to the "Ghosts 'n' Goblins" level of frustration. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bosses are all [pretty] tough, but they're mostly just a matter of finding the right attack pattern. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thankfully Tecmost off it to refill your Life Bar all the way at the beginning of each battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But your Special Weapon ammo depletes after beating a box. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the first boss is your father. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then of course, he makes a grave sacrifice to save Ryu proving that an old dying guy is faster than you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main bad guy is the occhio which I think is a made up Spanish word. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or maybe it's supposed to be pronounced Jackie O, which is utterly stupid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Can't name your video game, bad guy after the First Lady. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And he's really quite easy to get into the pattern of avoiding his fireballs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you mess up and get hit, it's, sort of, hard to get back into the pattern. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once he's killed Rio pretend to be in love with the big haired chick. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite the fact that the [only] words ever spoken to her so far, were a, it's a girl Get out of here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then taking his incredible slowness to a whole new level reapproved, he can't "OutRun" a fricking lunar eclipse. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then he must face the new Final boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a bit of luck with this guy, because he, sort of, -- these little swirly things he shoots out, will take out a huge chunk of your Life Bar, but they hit you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they get fired, sort of, like a random pattern. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So sometimes you get it a whole bunch of times; other times just they really hit you at all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After you've taken care of this guy, it's the father's death scene number three. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the bad guys face close up Konami style. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Ninja Gaiden". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What do we think? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the cutscenes are impressive and give the game of cinematic scope beyond any similar game to this era. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the game design is, sort of, weird and filled with nonsensical enemies like a football Players. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Difficulty ranges from challenging but good to stupidly difficult cheap. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, the boss battles are over a cool-looking and mostly well thought out.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, Rio himself is the lamest ninja ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I, is he even a real ninja? Or did you still like one of those dads all outfits? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On all this is [pretty] good but the game could stand to be refined and tweaked a little bit, which is exactly what happened with "Ninja Gaiden 2". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But despite its flaws, it's still a landmark title (for the FamiCom in Nintendo Entertainment Castlevania). 🍇🍌
