🤖🍊🍓 Hey, real quick announcement, here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As you might know, all the kids, nowadays, are gaga over this thing called the Twitter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well, it's finally happened. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Dr. Sparkle is on Twitter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You can check out the 'Chrontendo' Twitter at @Chrontendo. 🍇

👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chronturbo Episode 4 ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, folks, here we are again with the long, long-delayed "Chronturbo Episode <Four::4>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm not gonna offer up any excuses as to why this is so damn late. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Let's just jump in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] big episode today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Aside from the usual stuff like some Arcade ports, uh, from Namco and Taito, a few Sports Games, and some R.P.G.s, we have a few new publishers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Most importantly, Telenet, who releases the first <third::3rd>-party-published <C.D.-ROM-ROM::CD-ROM²> game - and would go on to be a [pretty] big presence on the P.C. Engine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Speaking of the <C.D.-ROM-ROM::CD-ROM²>, <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989> has been a slow year with [only] one game released in the first quarter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I don't think it really started, sort of, taking over until maybe Spring <Nineteen-Ninety::1990>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But we do have two new C.D. games - both of which sort of set the pattern for the system. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Which is that you would take like a regular HuCard game and inject it with prerecorded music and voice work and throw in a few elaborate animated cutscenes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And both these games introduced a series to the P.C. Engine that would become quite successful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, let's get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Makai Hakkenden Shada 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 April 1 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: DECO 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 April <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989> gets off to a fast start with Data East releasing their second P.C. Engine game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Hmm! This is a [pretty] sexy title screen! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game is "Makai Hakkenden Shada", and it is an Action R.P.G.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, if you thought that opening sequence with a naked lady and the title feeding it reminds you a little bit of Falcom's "<Ease::Ys>", well, that is not a coincidence. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You see, "Makai Hakkenden Shada" is a [pretty] blatant "<Ease::Ys>" clone. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, I know some folks have taken issue with me referring to some games we've covered as a "...Zelda..." clone or a "Dragon Quest" clone. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I understand! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe it's better to say 'inspired by the design [and] success of "...Zelda..."'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe that would be more accurate. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But "Makai Hakkenden Shada" really is an "<Ease::Ys>" clone, albeit one that is noticeably inferior to "<Ease::Ys>" itself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 First of all, I should point out that this game is based on an epic <Nineteenth::19th> century Japanese novel called "Nansō Satomi Hakkenden" - sometimes called "Eight Dog Chronicles" in English, though apparently there has never been a complete English translation of this book. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's been made into movies, cartoons, and all sorts of things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But <Eighty-Nine::'89> was the big year for 'Hakkenden' video games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We already saw S.N.K.'s "Satomi Hakkenden" in "Chrontendo (ah) Episode <Forty-One::41>", which was sort of an unusual R.P.G. from S.N.K.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there was, amazingly, a third game, "Shin Satomi Hakkenden", which was developed by Micronics. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And we'll be covering that in some future episode of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And after that, well, there are actually no other really obvious video game adaptations of the book, though references are made in, uh, ya know, various video games from time to time (for example, uh, Capcom's "Okami"). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now, as we can see, this game [pretty] much copies "<Ease::Ys>" in almost every possible way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The combat is exactly the same. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You run into enemies to kill them, but you can't hit them directly on or you'll take too much damage. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Instead, you need to move to the side a bit and then run into them - so you sort of clip them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Uh... Doing so will very slowly fill up your experience bar and level up when it's completely full. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The interface with the multiple bars is, again, taken directly out of "<Ease::Ys>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and in "<Ease::Ys>", you regain health by standing still for a minute. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And you want to guess how you regain health in this game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Hmm. Well! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But it's also a little bit less balanced than "<Ease::Ys>" was. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's very easy to get killed, especially at first. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Hitting an enemy at just a tiny bit off from the correct angle can quickly take your life bar down to zero. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And enemies will sometimes make a <ninety-degree::90°> turn, right as you're hitting them, and they'll actually walk directly into killing you instantly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The hit detection is [pretty] wonky and this becomes very clear because when you die, the screen freezes for a second. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there have been times where I've been killed and then, looking at the frozen screen, I can see a very noticeable amount of space between me and the enemy that happened to kill me, but yet it's still registered as a hit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, every time you gain a level, the enemies who were suddenly fighting become super weak compared to you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, these enemies suddenly stop giving out X.P.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 On the other hand, enemies that are just one level, like, above you, you probably can't even damage them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When you hit 'em, you'll just get sort of, like, metallic 'ching' sound. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There are a few roadblocks in this game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, this guy will instantly kill you if you don't have enough help. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You need to be at full health; otherwise, it's instant death. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you do get past him, then the first of your eight companions will appear... briefly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, in S.N.K.'s 'Hakkenden' game, the other Samurai {will} join your party. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Uh... But since this game is, like, a single character Action R.P.G., they just appear for a moment and then leave. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, in this case, the genre (an Action R.P.G.) doesn't really work very well [with] the source material. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I think probably really like a more traditional turn-based R.P.G. with multi-party members probably would have made more sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Though, I ran into some trouble here I was poisoned, which means my Health Bar does not regenerate. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In order to move on to the next area, I had to cross a patch of ground that damages my health. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this would have killed me because my health was too low. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I actually needed {to} go back to the first village to buy a remedy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But I couldn't find my way back because I got to the area via some sort of hidden door that teleported me here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I assume there is another hidden door somewhere around here to get back but I couldn't find it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, I actually had to reload an earlier save. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One nice thing about the game is you can save [pretty] much any time just by going into the menu. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There's a few other minor annoyances in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Um... When you go into an E... -- eh, an N.P.C. to talk to them, you don't have to press a button to actually trigger the dialogue box; just touching them this -- does this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However, sometimes it's actually hard to, uh, move away from [an] N.P.C. without triggering the dialogue box again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, you might trigger it multiple times, especially if you and the N.P.C. are, like, in a narrow area between two buildings or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The actual game, "<Ease::Ys>", will be released for the P.C. Engine in, uh, late <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But I guess if you were really desperate to play it on the console in the mid-<Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>, this was your [only] option. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Energy 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 April 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Quasar Soft | Masaya 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: NCS 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Eesh! That's one lazy looking title screen! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is another game from N.C.S. under the name of Masaya. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Their other games were not that bad, but "Energy" is a completely different story. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's considered to be one of the worst games on the P.C. Engine (at least one of the worst gameplay-wise; the music is super rad). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh, why are these guys all watching snuff movies? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And what is this guy's issue? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Look at his face! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The one thing "Energy" does have in its favor: it looks better than similar terrible games on the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Imagine this level being down-converted to FamiCom-style graphics. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It would look like, uh, "Batsu & Terii". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game is a remake of, sort of, a P.C.-<Eighty-Eight::88> game called "Ash", by a company called Quasar Soft, which came out in <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Ash" seems [pretty] obscure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And I don't know what prompted N.C.S. to port this to the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But there are a number of [pretty] serious technical problems with this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Obviously, the scrolling between screens - it is so slow. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In most games we've seen, there'll be a stretch of several screens which have smooth scrolling, and then when you get to, like, the end of that area and move into a new area, then you'll have, like, the flip-screen scrolling. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But why does "Energy" scroll for every single screen in the game? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, I love this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They didn't make your character a default to a sprite that shows him standing stationary when he stops moving. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, when he's not running, he just stopped in the middle of the run cycle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He'll just stand there with his leg up in the air or whatever. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then continue the run cycle when make him start to move again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's actually, uh, [pretty] amazing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 More knowing are the dialogue boxes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some boxes just hang there. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The box appears, but you hit the button, and nothing happens until, like, five seconds later, then the box disappears. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why do some boxes insist on hanging around for five seconds before you can close them? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And then there's a similar sort of thing that happens in these rooms. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The room becomes locked until you kill all the enemies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But once the enemies are gone, it takes a few seconds for the path to be unblocked. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Just like the speech boxes, I -- I can't believe this is on purpose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This must be bad coding or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Other fun stuff: trying to jump up against the wall. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your guy just spazzes out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Or, uh, holding down the jump button and, uh, [ya get] this lovely noise. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Much of the game involves exploring these caves. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's like a crappy version of "Metroid" basically. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are bits of backtracking and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 {You} need to free this frog-looking guy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Notice how unpredictable the hit detection is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sometimes when those green guys, uh, touch me as they pass over, I lose a bit of life. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Other times, I do not. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You have various equippable items or rather abilities into use. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is what appears to be a dog tag; [you] use this [to] cross the river. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, one [great] thing about "Energy", as I mentioned, the *music*. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Check this out! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This musical theme is so sleazy! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The guy who wrote this must have had a second career scoring <Eighties::'80s> porn movies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This music almost makes up for the rest of the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A lot of mediocre P.C. Engine games have just the sickest music, I've noticed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, soon it's back to climbing down barbed wire vines and... 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oh! Here we get a, uh, boss battle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, who's this guy? The dude who was, uh, killed in the intro? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The key to defeating the rock face monster is jumping up above that, um, sort of rock head thing blocking the exit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And in what must be an amazing show of chutzpah (or possibly incompetence) the game designers made the boss keep throwing out fireballs for a full two or three seconds after he's been defeated and has completely disappeared from the screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A fireball just comes out of nowhere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, while "Energy" is a terrible game, it is, sort of, entertaining in it's wackiness. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What other games have you jumping over weird alien heads squirting blood out of their brains? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And why does it literally take four seconds for the screen to scroll up to the next screen? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And why {do} [ya] find a Pop singer standing on a ledge who then refills your health and E.S.P. with her song? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, while "Energy" is terrible, and frustrating, and hard to play without getting very angry, it's at least not as boring as some of the terrible FamiCom kusoge games we've seen. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Wonder Momo 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 April 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Namco 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If you remember all the way back to "Chronturbo Number <One::1>", [you'll] recall that Namco was the first <third::3rd>-party publisher to release games on the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And so far, they are the -- *also* the most prolific. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Today we have the sixth, seventh, and eighth Namco P.C. Engine games, starting with "Wonder Momo". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Why is she yawning? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, we'll see in a moment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Namco seems somewhat uncommitted to putting out original game to the console. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 All three of today's titles are based on Arcade games - and not even really recent Arcade games either. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Wonder Momo" is... well, I wouldn't quite call it a Beat-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It almost has, sort of, a proto-Beat-'em-Up feel. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Arcade game came out in <Nineteen-Eighty-Seven::1987> - not ancient, by any means, but it was on the old Namco <Eighty-Six::86> board. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Most of the other games we've seen for the P.C. Engine were on the higher-end, uh, System <One::1> board (like "Dragon Spirit"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here we can easily tell that this was, uh, referencing the M.G.M. Lion roar. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Somehow this reference became a bit, uh, hazy in the console port. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Wonder Momo" is another one of those games that plays out on the proscenium, as you appear to be taking place in some sort of Tokusatsu stage show. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nintendo Life in their review of the Virtual Console release said this was the sort of thing you'd see performed in Japanese shopping malls. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And, of course, Momo herself wears a very short skirt which, at times, reveals her panties. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This actually figures into the gameplay a bit, as an audience member with a camera appears to photograph Momo as her skirt is up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If he succeeds, she is paralyzed for a moment in embarrassment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Between levels, you will get increasingly racier illustrations of Momo relaxing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The idea behind "Wonder Momo" is simply to kick every bad guy that appears. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Um... When the Wonder Meter is charged, you will change into Wonder Momo and you become a bit more powerful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 These flying guys here are really annoying! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, here we go. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When in Wonder Momo form, you get this hula hoop-looking weapon, which you can throw. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, you do need to catch it after you throw it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Often they'll go just, sort of, sailing off towards the wings of the stage and will bounce back towards you later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's another little bit between stages. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The final one actually shows Momo taking a bubble bath. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I'll admit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I've seen this game but never really played it until now, so I'm [pretty] terrible at it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it seems to be all about mastering the enemy patterns. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's almost like a rhythm game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It definitely does not play the way most post-"Renegade"-style Beat-'em-Ups play. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, you [only] use kicks and you have, like, no special moves, other than a rather silly-looking split kick. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Apparently, this is one of the most readily available P.C. Engine cards in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 According to Kevin Gifford of 'Mag Weasel', <ten::10> years ago you could still get sealed shipping packs containing six copies of the game for around <One-Hundred yen::¥100>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I would call "Wonder Momo" a well-made game, but it does seem just a little odd. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Susano-ou Densetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 April 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One last April game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This one is from Hudson themselves, though the words 'Kadokawa shoten' on the title screen there means that this is a licensed game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You know, the last game we saw from Hudson was the "Space Adventure Cobra..." C.D.-ROM game from "...Episode <Three::3>" so yeah, Hudson was totally getting into the whole licensed game field - in particular manga licenses it seems, because that is where the money is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If you're a huge fan of manga, you might look at this and say, 'Oh yeah! Those weird-shaped eyes and the spiky flame-like hair...', and you'll think of, uh, Go Nagai. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, yes, Go Nagai is one of the big old granddaddies of manga and this is the second in the guy-based game we've seen (the other being that 'Devil Man' game, which we just covered in "Chrontendo ... <Forty-Four::44>"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Susano Oh Densetsu" is based on the Go Nagai comic (called just 'Susano Oh'), which originally ran in the 'Weekly Shoten Magazine' in the late <Seventies::'70s> and early <Eighties::'80s>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though a few sequels appeared, including one actually called 'Susano Oh Densetsu Yami no Majin Hen' from <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, I assume that that manga was the inspiration for this game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though I really know nothing about that particular comic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And going one step further out? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The comic is, of course, named after the Shinto deity, Shinto deity, Susanoo, who was the son of Izanami, who you might recall figured into that wacky Shoot-'em-Up game, "Hanii in the Sky", from last episode of 'Chronturbo'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, of course, you'll also encounter him in various 'Megami Tensei' games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I suppose Susanoo is technically like the great, great, great, great, great uncle of the Emperor of Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, after that rad opening, the game starts and you will see that you are on the typical J.R.P.G. world. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's funny we absolutely do not think of Hudson as being an R.P.G. company. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yet we've already seen them released "Jaseiken Necromancer" (that was the first P.C. Engine R.P.G.) and then "Dungeon Explorer" (which was an R.P.G.-ish "Gauntlet" clone). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there's actually another Hudson R.P.G. later this episode. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, Hudson is actually really getting into R.P.G.s! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game takes place after the demons [have ruined] the world (uh, sorta like 'Devil Man', actually). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the sidewalks all have huge cracks in them, buildings are all dirty, and women wear bikinis. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Thankfully, you can walk in just any town and find those R.P.G. standbys, the Inn, the Weapon Shop, and the Item Shop. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Though, in this case, we actually break with tradition and we have two Item Shops: the bar and the butcher shop (in which you can buy delicious healthy red meat). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Weapon Shop is manned by some sort of lunatic with a mohawk, facial scar, and who is holding a flail, and wearing a neckerchief. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm going to buy the 'naifu' (or 'knife'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 After talking to some folks and starting up a little quest, ya head on out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, 'gosh darn it', you that is one teeny little sprite. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, look at how small that guy is! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, this is kind of like "Zelda <Two::II>...". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can see enemies walking around on the screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They just, sort of, appear as [ya get] close to 'em and then combat starts when one touches you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, I'm not gonna pretend that "Susano Oh Densetsu" is a fantastic game, but the combat is a little different than most "Dragon Quest" clones. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This looks like an Action R.P.G., [but it's] actually turn-based. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The action starts off frozen and nothing happens until we enter a command, then everyone performs one move, so I'll hit any monsters within striking range. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 [Now], I [only] have a knife and no magic, so I can't really attack anyone [until] they get up close. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The number that appears over my head shows how many moves I have each turn. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This will go up as the game progresses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As you defeat each monster, you get experience and money. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I assume this was, sort of, inspired by the 'Ultima' games, which had a very similar form of combat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll reach a house and an old dude who lets ya stay there and replenish your health for free. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Ya then hand him the letter you received in the first town and you'll get some sort of Experience Points. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Um... Yes, this is actually a very, sort of, like, a Westerny style here, in which you get Experience Points from completing quests. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game also has some scripted events. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Immediately after leaving the old dude's house, you run into a group of monsters chasing some guy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I wouldn't call this a boss battle exactly, but they are a bit tougher than the other enemies I've encountered so far. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 After killing them, the guy gives you a big wad of cash. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, what are some other cool things about "Susano Oh Densetsu"? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, you can hire mercenaries at the bar naturally. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This lady is [pretty] powerful! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, at this point, I have some magic spells that perform ranged attacks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And also, I can now perform two actions per turn, instead of just one, hence that little <Two::02> over my head. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There's also a day and night cycle, similar to that in "Dragon Quest <Three::III>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Just like many R.P.G.s of this time, it's not exactly fantastic-looking. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, the same sprites are used over and over again for the townsfolk. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And the way they appear on the map does not match up to the little portraits that appear when you talk to 'em. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This guy, for example, looks like Hulk Hogan until [ya start] talkin' to him, and then [he becomes] sort of, like, this generic guy with a black hair. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And that's actually [pretty] common in these old Japanese -- Japanese games, now that I think about it (sort of the mismatched hair colors on the characters). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 According to Kevin Gifford, one of the people who worked on this was Hiromasa Awasaki, who was also the main programmer on the P.C. Engine version of "<Ease::Ys>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Susano Oh Densetsu" was a [pretty] pricey game at <Sixty-Five-Hundred yen::¥6500>, which is about <one-thousand yen::¥1000> higher than most HuCards. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, while this does seem like a [pretty] decent game, it was completely overshadowed by Hudson's next R.P.G., which came out two months later. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Power Golf 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 May 25 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, folks, I hate to do this to you, but we have two Golf Games in a row. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 First up is "Power Golf" by Hudson. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you've seen "Chronturbo ... <Three::3>", you know that we had two Golf Games in that episode too (Data East's "Winning Shot" and N.C.S.'s "Ganbare! Golf Boys"). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So the P.C. Engine had four Golf Games in the first five months of <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>... which seems like a little too many. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Power Golf" is definitely the most colorful-looking of the two today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's got rather appealing-looking graphics. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The swing animation is nicely done. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Even the golf cart -- club selector box is [pretty] fancy! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's, like, these little renderings of the golf clubs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 When the ball is up in the air, you can actually see the dimples in the surface of the ball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 See? These are all nice touches. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And, of the two Golf Games, I'd say "Power Golf" is a little more... well, I wouldn't say fun, exactly, but... look at the box art on the games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Power Golf"'s art is much more dynamic and, uh, "Naxat Open" is, uh, much more austere. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It looks like it's going for an older audience. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As for "Power Golf", underneath the presentation, it's really the same as every other Golf Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It just has the old power beater which we've seen on [pretty] much every single Golf Game since Nintendo's original "Golf". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At least the P.C. Engine's excellent color palette allows for a nice-looking game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like, look at the sand traps, there! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's (what?) six different colors in there - from a pale yellow to a reddish brown. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Power Golf", uh, is full of those nice little details. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Naxat Open 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 May 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Tose 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Naxat Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, "Naxat Open". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And see they're going with the classic drop-down and bounce logo effect. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Certainly not the best ever music on the P.C. Engine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Nice! Those two names are supposed to reference Jumbo Ozaki and Isao Aoki (two very famous Japanese golfers). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is the old, uh, 'switch a letter in the name' business, so you don't have to pay money to the real person. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 HAL Labs had already put out an official 'Jumbo Ozaki' game in <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988> on the FamiCom, as you might recall. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Naxat Open" is a little bit different, since the holes all exist in the same (I don't know) world(?). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As you look at the course from above, you can see multiple holes at once. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, you could in theory, uh, sort of, shoot your ball onto the next hole. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As opposed to "Power Golf" whereas each hole exists like in its own little separate universe and nothing exists outside of the boundaries. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Naxat Open" is certainly not as [pretty] as "Power Golf". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 {It} does have more option, like the adjustable crosshairs on the golf ball. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's also very hard and unforgiving. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If your timing is just a little bit off, well, then your shot is [pretty] much ruined. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And it's not just like there's a little bit of a hook or a slice but more like just you completely wasted a shot; it goes like five feet. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, the game is unforgiving, the graphics and music are worse than "Power Golf", ... 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Uh... When you swing, you use the same three-button-press Power Meter, but the game uses, like, this weird wooden artists posing mannequin thing as your person. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If "Naxat Open" seems a little underwhelming, well, then maybe it has something to do with the fact that it's developed by our good old buddies Tose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They had done a port of an earlier Arcade game for Namco on the P.C. Engine, but this is, I believe, their first completely original game on the console. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One thing that drives me crazy is the clubs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have to manually select the clubs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, some Golf Games will automatically select [an acceptable] club for you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But "Naxat Golf" does some sort of annoying things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like I accidentally, uh, hit a ball a little bit off the green. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I was already using the putter but since I was technically no longer on the green, it actually switched me to the sand wedge. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 By the time I realized what had happened, it was too late. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, it sometimes makes you manually pick your clubs and other times, just, sort of, automatically changes you to a different club. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's -- It's quite annoying. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Overall, the presentation is certainly a few steps down from "Power Golf". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, looking at the sand traps, they [only] have four colors, as opposed to (what did we say?) six(?) in "Power Golf". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Overall, everything is a little bit less fun than "Power Golf" and "Power Golf" was really not that fun to begin with. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, I would probably avoid this game if I were you. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pac-Land 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 June 1 🇯🇵 // 1990 January [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Namco 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Namco 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 June <first::1st> is here and it's game number two from Namco. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Note the extra 'L' in 'control'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, about the controls, there are two options: button and lever control. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You'll probably want to switch to lever. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 'But, Dr. Sparkle, what the heck is the lever control?'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, it means 'joystick control'... except, I guess, it really means D-Pad control. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We'll discuss this in a second. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Pac-Land" takes the basic premise of "Pac-Man" (that is Pac-Man moves around avoiding ghosts) and transports it from a maze into the <quote-unquote real world::"real world">, full of houses, streets, cars, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was a port of Namco's Arcade game from <Nineteen-Eighty-Four::1984>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Pac-Land", despite not being that well-remembered today, was actually an enormously important game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 After "Pac-Man" became a huge smash, both Namco and Bally Midway [released] sequels, such as, uh, "Ms. Pac-Man", "Pac-Man Jr.", "Super Pac-Man", et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 All were maze games quite similar to the original, but "Pac-Land" completely changed the formula. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, it virtually created the formula for side-scrolling Platformers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sure, there were a few earlier proto-side-scrolling games, like, uh, "B.C. Quest for tires", but "Pac-Land" really kicked off the genre. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A year later, "Super Mario Bros." and "Ghosts 'n' Goblins" were released. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I assume the title even inspired Nintendo who gave their, uh, Platformers, uh, games names like, uh, "Super Mario Land" and, uh, "Super Mario World" or "Donkey Kong Country". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is the U.S. version, which depicts "Pac-Man" as he appears in the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Japanese version gave him a slightly different appearance. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Part of the problem with Pac-Man's appearance, of course, was that in the first video game, he was depicted as a yellow circle with a piece missing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But there really wasn't any sort of agreement as to what he would look like if you were in like a walking, talking, living human being. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Thus, when shown outside of the video game, he tended to look completely different, based on, you know, who was doing the drawing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Pac-Land" was released on both the P.C. Engine and the <Turbo-Graphics-Sixteen::TurboGrafx-16> and both used the same sprite for Pac-Man, actually, based on that of the Japanese Arcade game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game is [pretty] faithful to the original. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The structure is very simple; walk from your house through a few different types of environments before the time runs out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And when you reach the end, the fairy lady gives you magic shoes that allows you to fly through the air while you're traveling back home. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oddly, the path back is always shorter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I think the whole story here is [that] you are somehow, uh, smuggling fairies in your hat. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though, why the hell is "Pac-Man" even wearing a hat with a feather in it? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It makes him look like, uh, Harvey Keitel in "Taxi Driver". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, earlier, I mentioned the controls options: button and lever. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Arcade "Pac-Land" had a very odd control scheme. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There were buttons for mo... -- moving left and right, but no joystick. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The P.C. Engine version's, uh, button control option allows you to recreate that rather awkward control scheme. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though you will probably hate using the buttons to move left and right, so they did add another control scheme which allows it to play more like any other side-scroller, using the, uh, D-Pad to move. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well, "Pac-Land" is very simple compared to just about any later Platformer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Many of its devices became, sort of, 'stock' for the genre, such as mysterious floating platforms that move on their own accord, various death traps that activate automatically when you get close to them, uh, various, uh, things you need to jump over. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And those little springboards were reused for Namco's, uh, FamiCom game, "Wagan Land", which is, uh, virtually "Pac-Land"'s spiritual successor. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And S... -- also Sega's "Wonder Boy" is very [much inspired] by "Pac-Land". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not the most involving game by [today's] standards, but it's certainly worth a try. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Wai Wai Mahjong 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 June 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Video System 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh, God! Really? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Another Mahjong Game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, it was bound to happen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Wai Wai Mahjong" is a [pretty] typical Mahjong Game of the time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's one-on-one Mahjong. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In real life, Mahjong is played with four people but Computer games, it's often one-on-one. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At least the opponents look well-drawn! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a certain amount of effort and character put into them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'll go with the nun. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 She looks like a real cream puff; it oughta be easy to beat her. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The publisher has one of the most unmemorable names ever to grace a video game company: 'Video System'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So boring! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, what could be a worse name? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, how about 'Mick O'River'? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 'Mick O'River'!? Who would ever call their video game company that? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, actually Video System did; when they decided to, uh, open up a U.S. branch, they called it 'Mick O'River'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Video System released mostly Arcade games in the <Eighties::'80s>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the <Nineties::'90s> they did a few Console games for the Super FamiCom (and later on the Saturn and Nintendo <Sixty-Four::64> - lots of Mahjong and F-<One::1> Racing Games). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Probably about the one thing that you might remember them putting out was a series of Shoot-'em-Ups under the name 'Aero Fighters' or 'Sonic Wings'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These were, like, these really nutty Vertical Shooters, where your pilots would be, like, a one-year-old baby or a talking dolphin. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They were actually quite good! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, the folks who made 'Aero Fighters' left Video System to start their own company called 'Psycho', who became one of the main Shoot-'em-Up developers of the <Nineties::'90s>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, Man! I actually kind of wish I was covering 'Aero Fighters' today instead of "Wai Wai Mahjong". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, anyway, "Wai Wai Mahjong": nice colorful-looking, uh, Mahjong Game that you [are probably not] going [to] *care about*. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 *But Video System is* the first of our four new publishers today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 *Let's now take* a look at a company that you *might* actually know a little bit more about. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fire Pro Wrestling Combination Tag 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 June 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Human 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Human Entertainment 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh man! That is one screwy looking title screen! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But hey! At least the fire is, sort of, animated. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is, of course, "Fire Pro Wrestling Combination Tag" from Human. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And this is the first game published by Human, under their own name. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though we have already seen quite a few games developed by Human, especially for Bandai - the most recent being "Monster Party" in the last episode of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Actually, "Monster Party" in this game were released on the same month. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is, rather obviously, a Wrestling Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It has several gameplay options for up to five players. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, uh, there's also a Tag Team mode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The roster is composed of characters that are based on real wrestlers, but with really silly fake names. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are both Japanese wrestlers and Americans who had done some time in the Japanese leagues, including one guy, Bruiser Brody, who'd actually been murdered by another wrestler the year before this came out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, what's "Fire Pro Wrestling..." like? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, you know, you actually already sort of know this game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Before Human were called Human, they were known as 'Sonata'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Uh... For example, the 'Family Trainer' games were mostly done under the Sonata name. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And before Sonata, there existed a little company called T.R.Y., and one of the games T.R.Y. worked on was Nintendo's "Pro Wrestling". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In many ways "Fire Pro Wrestling..." is an updated version of that game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The moves and controls are actually very similar to the Nintendo game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And they use some of the old animations for "Fire Pro Wrestling...". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The main wrestler in both games is even based on the same person, Antonio Inoki. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, this game is, sort of, the spiritual successor to "Pro Wrestling". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 While moving around in the ring, you can kick and punch, um, eh, but most of the moves are performed for, uh -- from a grapple. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You just walk up to your opponent, and a sec later you'll start giving each other a shoulder massage. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then a sec later both guys will do a little squat and, at that very moment, you, uh, sort of, enter in your button press for the move. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Then you, uh, suplex the guy or whatever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Each character has his own little move set. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the main trick here is the timing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The move must be entered in at just the right moment. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Otherwise, the opponent will get the upper hand and perform his move first. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, precision is the key here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There are a number of nice touches and "Fire Pro Wrestling..." (the camera pans around the ring, there's a lot of detail in the audience with many unique faces). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Naturally, characters can enter and exit the ring. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Um... However, once my fighter got stuck trying to climb the ropes when the opponent came and was, uh, right on the other side. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This sort of froze the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I couldn't move. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm not sure if this is a game bug or {an} emulation bug, but it did freeze up everything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, when the fighters hit each other, you get... something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Uh... Some reviewers of this game call it blood, but I'm not so sure. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It... I guess it really could just be action lines; it's kind of hard to tell. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, one distinguishing feature in the 'Fire Pro Wrestling' series is the customizability of your wrestlers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But that does not happen here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Human wouldn't really introduce the customization options until later games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I suppose the series would not really blossom until the, uh, Super FamiCom era where, uh, the infamous game designers, Suda <Fifty-One::51>, was working on a few titles. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Um... But, for now, "Fire Pro Wrestling..." is just sort of a solid if not spectacular Wrestling Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Valis II 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 June 23 🇯🇵 // 1990 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Laser Soft 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Telenet Japan 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We have two C.D. games today, both of which were quite popular in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 {The} first up is a doozy: "Valis <Two::II>" - one of the first games to make heavy use of anime-style cutscenes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's also the first P.C. Engine game published by Telenet - a company that came to, uh, heavily specialize in games [for the] P.C. Engine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One thing that's interesting about the P.C. Engine is that, aside from Namco and Taito [and] those guys, we are seeing publishers that did not release games to the FamiCom (such as N.C.S., Face, and Telenet). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the console's later years, you're gonna see, like, a lot of, uh, sort of, less family-friendly games and a lot of publishers whose names will be unfamiliar to you if you, sort of, haven't studied up on the P.C. Engine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Valis <Two::II>" is the second C.D. game we've covered that received a U.S. release. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The, uh, first was "Fighting Street", of course. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, unlike "Fighting Street", this game has a lot of voice dialogue (meaning that it had to be all re-recorded in English). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The publisher Telenet has a, uh, rather, uh, baffling array of internal divisions (most famously Wolf Team). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And "Valis <Two::II>" was done by 'Laser Soft', though Atlus' name is actually found in the credits, so they did some work on this, it seems. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's a rather impressive opening. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's also got some really great music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "The enemy... Could it be the Rogueless?" 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Yuko! You must see Varna!" 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "That's Reiko's voice! I wonder if something's happened on Bekanti!" 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Lengthy cutscenes were starting to become quite common on Japanese Computer games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But we've never seen anything quite like this on a Console game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There is tons of spoken dialogue, sound effects, and dramatic visual spectacle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's like "Ninja Gaiden" on steroids. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's too bad the game itself is a little on the mediocre side. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's mostly in the style of 'run to the left and shoot at enemies' - you know, that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's hardly kusoge, like "Energy", but it's not exactly "Ninja Gaiden" either. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Valis <Two::II>" started life on home computers, just like the first 'Valis' game, which we'd earlier seen ported to the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Computer version of "Valis <Two::II>" is a <litte b'l::[little bit]> more interesting in the gameplay department. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You could do things like switch between weapons and armor types at will. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A lot of this had been removed for the, uh, P.C. Engine version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You can still change weapons here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, this is done in a more traditional fashion, by picking up power-ups. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The weapon type and level is seen in the upper left. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can also pick up special items, like a rotating shield thing, and a rather boring lightning attack, and also brief invulnerability. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At the end of each level, you get, like, a, uh, "Darius"-type warning about the uncoming -- upcoming boss battle, including its height and weight, for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Then the boss indulges in a bit of exposition, some of which is not very well recorded. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Come, Warrior Vari, let's engage in combat!" 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Why have you come to the world of reality?" 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "I must have your sword!" 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 After the battle, it's then off to another cutscene. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Unfortunately, these are stuck in a little tiny viewing window. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Much like, um, the full motion videos that you see on Sega C.D. games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There was the occasional full screen illustration that used scrolling, which looks [pretty] cool. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The story here is that the brother of Rogueless (who was the main bad guy from the first game) is now using his armies to conquer all of Bekanti. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's the Fantasy world that Yuko has, uh, somehow been sucked into. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first level takes place on Earth, and after that, you go travel to Bekanti. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And the remaining levels take place in, uh, various sort of video game Fantasy settings. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Most levels look [pretty] cool, but there's nothing too amazing going on here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Each level does seem a little long and repetitive. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You know, after playing games on the FamiCom for so long and hearing [only] this, uh, poorly-synthesized speech for so long, it just seems really weird to listen to normal recorded speech by human voice actors and video games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It almost sounds a little wrong somehow. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Space Adventure Cobra..." from March <Eighty-Nine::'89> used a bit of voice acting, but nothing to this level! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Let me pass on this road!". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I am the Shadow Panther, Gilan, one of Rogueless' <twelve::12> generals! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I am all that remains of the Rogueless army. In the name of Rogueless and his honor, I...". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Most of the bosses are actually a piece of cake, except for the final one. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "...You a chance to make your own choice: Fight or join my army!" 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "You wish to die?" 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Yaaa!" 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Ew!! Yes, uh... "Valis <Two::II>" definitely had some content that was not for the little ones. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And while "Valis <Two::II>" is not an H Game, it is definitely a little naughty. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was aimed squarely at an audience of, uh, horny anime geeks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The heroine, whose name is a Yuko, not Valis (Valis is the name of the sword she carries) is generally depicted in a series of revealing outfits (of the metal bikini variety). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first level took place in Tokyo, then we moved on to a cave, now we're in some sort of fortress or base or something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This adds a few more environmental hazards like little spiky things that move around and you need to avoid. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Valis (uh) <Two::II>" manages to be both, sort of, too difficult and too easy at the same time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are large stretches of the game where you're simply moving, uh, mowing down one enemy, one after the other. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then, at times, you get swarmed by multiple enemies at once and will be forced to take a lot of damage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However, Health Refills and power-ups are [pretty] numerous. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, even more important, you get a lot of extra lives. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once you learn the location of the strong enemies that tend to, sort of, jump out and surprise you, you can probably breeze right through the first three levels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Uh... Starting around Level <Four::4> it gets a little bit tough. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here is another 'piece of cake' boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, look how much health I had [stored] at the beginning of this fight. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oops! Since the boss also died, this actually didn't count as a lost life. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The cutscene gives an important plot point. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yuko meets up with the good guys and it turns out that she and the Princess are twins (separated at birth), which is no surprise, considering they look exactly alike. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Yuko also gets a new outfit - a rather skimpy tunic thing covering her crotch area. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, seriously, if you were a young lady (like, High School age) would you really wear something like that? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, I'd want pants or something to wear over that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The next level is a vol... -- volcanic cave. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first annoying and tough enemies start appearing here, like these robot dragons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They take a bunch of hits! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there's also various types of slime which are surprisingly resilient to your attacks! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though I do love the fiery dudes running at you... and the... uh -- the "Metroid"-like floating brains. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, here's some [pretty] bad voice work here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 ...my mother. The whole reason this war started was because you killed Rogueless!". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "The ways of Rogueless were evil! The same goes for Megas!". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At least in the English version, Yuko sounds, uh, somewhat tough and doesn't have that high-pitched little girl shriek that, uh, the Japanese find so appealing (because the Japanese, uh, version of this game definitely did have that). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 (And another super easy boss.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "There was a King who could..." 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Being anime-inspired, um, Megas is given a bit more personality than the typical video game villain. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Rather than trying to take over the world just because he's pure evil, he is trying to unite the world and thinks that conquering the other factions is the [only] way to do this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He ends up being an almost sympathetic character by the game's end, as opposed to the, uh, pure evil (like, uh, Ganon - or Dracula in the 'Castlevania' games). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "...unite the country. You cannot do it with just force alone.". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "My task is to unite the country by sheer force; when that is completed, I can relinquish power to my successor." 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Your successor?" 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Level <Five::5> must be Megas' headquarters, since his portrait is plastered everywhere. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's also full of various death traps and spiky objects. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It also has the boss with the worst name, Scarlet Fire Toe, and the silliest-sounding voice. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "...Megas!". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Even though you have succeeded in breaking the Emperor's power, you have not been able to stop the war!" 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "The exercise of...". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This guy sounds really campy! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If you play carefully, you can easily take this guy down without getting, uh, hit, even once. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 (Though I wasn't playing particularly careful when I was recording this.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Your Majesty! Grant me the power!" 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "This is a test of individual combat for both of you. If I were to help you to win, then it would no longer be a fair fight!" 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Your Majesty!" 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "En garde!" 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Man! Yuko is a stone cold killer for a High School age girl! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And one other weird thing: listening to the English voice acting, they actually pronounce it 'Varis', rather than 'Valis'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Valis <Two::II>" is [pretty] short ([only] six levels). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A quick run-through will take about <forty::40> minutes - and a nice chunk of that is cutscenes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The final level is simply a ride up this H.R. Giger-inspired elevator. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It does get a bit tough in places. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Ah! Here's Megas himself. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Hit Points infinite? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Hmm! That sounds bad! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, I complained that the bosses are too easy, but Megas is too hard! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And when I say 'hard', I [only] mean that his attacks are annoying, difficult, or impossible to dodge, and he takes way, way, way too many hits to kill. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Look at how little his health goes down when you hit him. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this is with a fully powered-up weapon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In a, uh, fine video game tradition, he has two forms, so you fight him twice in a row. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If you have en... ex... -- enough extra lives, it's tempting to not even really try to avoid his attacks and just get up close and start attacking over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 See, if you die, you instantly reincarnate - so you don't have to start the boss fight over. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But this does mean your weapon is now back to Level <One::1>, so the boss fight is now going to get even longer and more boring. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Seriously! Look at that Life Bar going down! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's more like a battle of patience. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Bravo! You are a great fighter! An even match always makes for an interesting fight.". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Finally, Yuko has a heart-to-heart talk with Megas, who comes across as a rather tragic Darth Vader-like figure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "...But I was assassinated in a plot hatched by the retainers of my younger brother, Rogueless. In order to stay alive, I received a Mechanical body. I resolved to challenge my brother, Rogueless.". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, "Valis {<Two::II>}" was a pioneering game, in its use of multimedia and cutscenes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the game itself isn't really always that much fun to play. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 After this, 'Valis' officially moved from Computers to the P.C. Engine, and there were a total of four 'Valis' games on the system, plus a collection of the cutscenes from those games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "...<Two::II>" and "...<Three::III>" debuted on the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the last game was actually a remake of the first "Valis". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, it's an important game in the history of the P.C. Engine for a number of reasons. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Cyber Cross 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 June 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: ITL 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Face 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, another game from Face (those guys who published that weird "Hanii in the Sky" game from "Chronturbo ... <Three::3>") "Cyber Cross" is yet another superhero-themed side-scroller - one with sort of a boring intro. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Geez! Look at this dude with his fingerless gloves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At least this part is a bit more interesting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This also gives you a, sort of, like, a little bit of a game demo as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, if you remember that, uh, sort of, silly-looking, uh, "...Shubibinman" game from last episode, you'll have a [pretty] basic idea of what "Cyber Cross" is like. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You sort of walk forward and shoot aliens. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Little flying capsules will appear from time to time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These can be destroyed to get a power-up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first one turns you into your costumed superhero form. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This gives you a powerful kick. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And when you hold down the attack button and release, you do this like little spinning kick thing, which I never used. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Additional power-ups will give you a weapon of some sort, depending on the color. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here, I've obtained a sword. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have a Power Meter of sorts at the bottom-right. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Those little stars will disappear when you take a hit, and when they're all gone, you lose your special weapon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Those power-up pods appear [pretty] frequently, but they fly by really fast, so you probably need to know when they're going to appear in order to grab them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 By replaying certain areas, you'll learn where they are ready to appear, so you can be ready to jump up and kick them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is obviously quite similar to the flying power-ups in "Contra", except those move much slower, and didn't rely quite so much on memorization. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, here is absolutely the best weapon, right here: the Laser Gun, which allows you to kill things before they get too close to ya! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's best to avoid the other types of power-ups once you have this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At the end of each area, you'll get a boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first guy is a frogman who jumps (no surprise there), but also breathes fire at you, which is not something you normally associate with frogs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You defeat him by ducking and cock-punching him to death, which is not the most heroic way to beat back invading alien forces. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Cyber Cross" was developed (or at least worked on) by I.T.L., which stood for Imaginative Technology Land. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And they were some sort of contract developer who were involved in all kinds of games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As far as I know, they're still around. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One of the more recent games they worked on was that "Miles Edgeworth" game from Capcom's 'Ace Attorney' series. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There is absolutely nothing in this game we haven't seen a million times before. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 From the subject matter to the general game design, "Cyber Cross" is a completely unoriginal and generic game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It doesn't play any differently than something like a "Valis <Two::II>" except the enemies here are more boring, and there's a lot more of them, and usually they just walk in a straight line right through you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The backgrounds are [pretty] boring too. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's really not too much to say about "Cyber Cross"! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's basically just a prettier-looking version of all those terrible, uh, FamiCom games put out by people like Bandai, starring Ultraman or something like that. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jinmu Denshō Yaksa 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 June 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Manjyudo | Wolfteam | Goblin Sound 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Big Club 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Much like "Energy", "Jinmu Denshou..."'s a terrible game with a cool soundtrack. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For some reason, this is often called "Jinmu Denshou Yaksa", even though the box art and title simply say 'Jinmu Denshou'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also, the word 'Jinmu' is often transliterated as 'Jinmmu' with two 'M's. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There are two modes here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 'Key' is probably less hateful than 'Auto', though I don't know why it's called Key Mode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 'Jinmu Denshou' means 'Legacy of Jinmu', 'Jinmu', of course, being the legendary first Emperor of Japan - or perhaps it simply refers to the time period in Japanese history when Jinmu supposedly ruled. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Incidentally, in pre-World War <Two::II> Japan, interest in Jinmu greatly increased. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And so he, sort of, became associated with the extreme nationalism and expansionism that spread throughout Japan at that time, since some believe that Jinmu said that Japan was destined to rule the world (or at least Asia). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 None of this has anything to do with "Jinmu Denshou...", which is a spin-off of a P.C.-<Eighty-Eight::88> R.P.G. called, "Yaksha". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Both games were worked on by Wolf Team, and this is, I'm [pretty] sure, the first Wolf Team game we've seen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though some other companies were also involved in the game as well - 'Goblin Sound' for one (who mostly did sound work) which eventually spun off another contract developer called 'Opus'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it seems the game was primarily designed by a company called 'Manjudo'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 All this info comes from, uh, Game Developer Research Institute, as you can probably surmise. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It was actually, uh, published by a company called 'Big Club'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 {I have} no idea who they are, but this is their first P.C. Engine game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, yes, "Jinmu Denshou..." is a "Space Harrier" clone - but one with a difference. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Mr. "Space Harrier" was armed with a blaster of some sort to deal with the waves of enemies that came flying at him. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yaksha, on the other hand, has a samurai sword, which means you must get very up close and personal in order to kill things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Or at least that's his default weapon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 By hitting one of those stone statues, you get a powerful upgrade that allows you to shoot fireballs or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The problem is, just like "Cyber Cross", taking a few hits will cause you to lose the weapon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the game is a major, major pain when you [only] have the default sword. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there is enough pain in this game as it is! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like these platform things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You are supposed to jump onto these platforms, but... do you know how everyone says that <Three-D::3D> Platforming was terrible in the early PlayStation era (before "...Mario <Sixty-Four::64>")? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, it turns out, it was even worse in <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The feeling of depth is really off in "Jinmu Denshou...". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is especially true in the boss battles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Speaking of which, look at this guy! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They don't even bother trying to make him not look like the "Space Harrier" dragon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One of the weird things, here, is that the boss has, um, advanced all the way forward and then turns around and starts heading away from you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But you can still get hit by him as he's moving away from you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I would assume that the best time to hit him would be as he's retreating. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it seems that he actually sorta, like, passes completely over your head and then when he turns around, he's still between you and the camera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, you can sorta see this here, when I jump up and hit the dragon's tail. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This sorta thing makes the boss battles [pretty] unbearable. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, at some point, he started, sort of, moving to the far right of the screen and eventually ended up moving off the screen most of the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The structure is just like "Space Harrier" as well. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 After each boss, you move on to a new area. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This one has a ceiling, just like some "Space Harrier" levels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh and yes, as you've noticed, you can actually stop your character's movement and even have him back up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He [only] moves when pressing on the D-Pad. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Taking your finger off the Up button will make him stand still. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And pressing Down will cause him to move in reverse. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is vital for getting those power-up-dropping statues, because you can often just blase right by them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have to stop and then go back and get the power-ups. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You know, like, as I mentioned, you do need to make sure you select the 'Key' option in the Main Menu, not 'Auto'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Overall, "Jinmu Denshou..." is a [pretty] frustrating experience. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It looks [pretty] decent. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the designers have really put some interesting detail in the game (like his butt cheeks are very lovingly detailed). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But overall this is, I'd say, near the bottom of the list of "Space Harrier" clones. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tengai Makyō: ZIRIA 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 June 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Red 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Ohhh!". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's the other C.D.-ROM game today (one that's even bigger than "Valis <Two::II>"!) "Far East of Eden: Ziria" (or "Tengai Makyō: ZIRIA") is the first game in an extremely popular series of R.P.G.s from Hudson (popular, in Japan, that is). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, you know, this series is often called, uh, 'Tengai Makyō' in the West, but the actual title screen and box art say "Far East of Eden: Ziria" in Roman characters - so that's what I'll call it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Just like "Valis <Two::II>", much of the selling point was the high-quality art, animation, and voice work. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Far East of Eden: Ziria" is the first R.P.G. on the <C.D.-ROM-ROM::CD-ROM²> system and certainly has the best presentation of any P.C. Engine R.P.G. we've seen so far. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, this looks [pretty] cool, right? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Much better than "Susano Oh..."? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The story here is that in ancient mythical Japan, this bad guy, Masakato, is taking over the world or something and then gets defeated by the forces of humanity. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But later, an evil cult is planning on resurrecting him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game was developed by a company called Red, who had previously worked on "Legendary Axe", one of the very best P.C. Engine games from <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The 'Far East of Eden' series was primarily conceived by one Yuji Hiroi, one of the major creative forces at Red. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later, he and Red would create an even more successful R.P.G. series for Sega called 'Sakura Taisen'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Everything about this game just screams 'prestige'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It has a murderer's row of voice acting talent - big names in Japan like Matsuo Iwata (who you might know from, uh, voicing the main character in the "Akira" movie), or Kaneto Shiozawa (who was in 'Gundam', 'Fist of the North Star', 'Dragon Ball', all kinds of stuff). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some of the music, including the main theme apparently, was written by none other than Ryuichi Sakamoto, who is probably about the most, uh, well-known and respected Japanese musician living today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And one of the very few that is widely known in the West, having won a Golden Globe, an Emmy, and an Oscar in <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988> for his work on the movie, "The Last Emperor". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, overall, "Far East of Eden" is a major effort. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, think about this; there's tons of voice dialogue here and "Final Fantasy <Seven::VII>" didn't even have that. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this came out in <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 How many R.P.G.s boasted these kind of production values back then? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game takes place in an imaginary version of Japan. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later games would make the setting even more and more ridiculous. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Um... But this is inspired by an actual piece of Japanese folklore called "Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari" about a magical ninja named Ziria; he was known for his toad magic. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Ziria was the subject of many Japanese movies, books, cartoons, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Uh... Two other major characters from the Ziria story turn up in this game as well. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For some reason, in the, uh, Roman characters, it's, uh, spelled with a 'Z', but the name is normally transliterated with a 'J'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 By some weird coincidence (or at least I think it's a coincidence) there was a T.V. show running in Japan abound this time called 'Sekai Ninja Sen Jiraiya'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This took the, uh, Jiraiya legend and transported into modern Japan. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was a, uh, typical Tokusatsu show that featured some, uh, ridiculous characters in the form of ninjas from around the world. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like a, uh, British Crusader ninja and an American Cowboy ninja. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, we've covered the background [pretty] well - but, uh, what about the game itself? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, it's more or less your s... -- sort of standard 'Dragon Quest'-type game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 {Ya} actually get some money from the toads here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This Toad thing is actually played up, uh, quite a bit in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have a magic Toad that joins your adventures later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You will quickly reach the first town and do the usual stuff. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here, I'm buying weapons and armor. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's also an Item Shop, an Inn, and, of course, various N.P.C.s to speak to. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oddly, you will find a doppelganger who wants to join you and sounds much like a female, so something sorta fishy is going on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Combat is turn-based and uses commands, just like every other R.P.G. at the time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have plans for Attack, Run, et cetera. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But look at that detailed background! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's like a miniature forest scene! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Compare this to "Phantasy Star <Two::II>" with its rather boring black backgrounds with the grids. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And look at those tanooki! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're so full of character. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And they're also [pretty] darn cute. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I feel sort of bad about attacking them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Wouldn't you rather pick one up and hug it? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's got a fluffy little tail! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 For some reason, tanookis seem to be a common enemy early in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 South of the first village, you'll find a cave. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In investigating that, you'll find a -- a path blocked by a giant boulder. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And it turns out that your friend is, in fact, a tanooki in disguise. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 (Tanooki are considered to be shapeshifters.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is the first boss battle in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, it's -- I guess it's like a very minor boss battle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 After defeating him or her, you'll be able to open up a treasure chest and get what I believe are supposed to be tweezers of some sort, and then use it to make this giant catfish sneeze, which will cause an earthquake that destroys the boulder. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Far East of Eden" has the standard R.P.G. pattern of moving from village to village, buying new equipment, encountering the, uh, dungeons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The main thing that makes it stand out from the tons of other J.R.P.G.s that were around at this time is simply the quality of the writing, art, and sound. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And speaking of the art, it was all done by one Torajiro Tsujino. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 To me, the illustrations look [pretty] Western in style, rather than the more typical anime stuff you usually see in Japanese video games, such as 'Valis'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 According to Kevin Gifford, "Far East of Eden" had a long protracted development. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Having been originally conceived by Oji Hiroi as a s... -- movie script. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was passed around to various animation studios before Hudson finally took interest. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Even then, it had a [pretty] long development time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And an early alpha version was apparently scrapped and the game started again from scratch. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, here's one cool bonus: The <C.D.-ROM-ROM::CD-ROM²> system required you to actually put in a special HuCard into the card slot whenever you wanted to play a C.D.-ROM game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you didn't have that card plugged in and you tried to play a C.D. game, you would get a warning screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some games would actually have little, sort of, hidden features appear when you did this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, if you do this in "Far East of Eden", you'll get this little set of movies showing the game's three main characters fighting the bad guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the U.S. we tend to think of, like, series like 'Bonk', or the soldier Shoot-'em-Ups, or "Bomberman" as being Hudson's flagship games for the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But, in Japan, "Far East of Eden" [pretty] much stands atop of Hudson's other P.C. Engine output. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Ya might remember that, uh, Famitsu Readers' Poll from <Two-Thousand-Six::2006> I discussed earlier. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The second "Far East of Eden" game come -- came in at Number <Twelve::12> on that list. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 (One of the very few non-Square-Enix or Nintendo games in the Top <Twenty::20>, landing right after "Dragon Quest <Five::V>" and well above stuff like "Street Fighter <Two::II>" and "Super Mario <Brothers::Bros.>" or "Link to the Past" or even "Chrono Trigger", for that matter.) 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yeah, in Japan these games are bigger than "Chrono Trigger". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Several sequels and spin-offs followed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This game was remade for the iPhone and the Xbox <Three-Sixty::360> of all things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And despite its... enormous success, um, Hudson never tried to bring the series to the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 [Only] one "Far East of Eden" game was ever released in English. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And it wasn't one of the main R.P.G. series games; it was a fighting game spin-off. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And actually, there aren't even any fan translations of the games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It is probably the major lost series of Japanese games for those of you in the West. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a real shame and hopefully that [will] change someday. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ninja Warriors 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 June 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Taito 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We'll finish off June with a title game "...Ninja Warriors", which takes place in the far-flung futuristic year of <Nineteen-Ninety-Three::1993>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What's going on here is the President has gone insane or something and a pair of ninja robots are dispatched to assassinate him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Yeah, so it's not the most, uh, politically appropriate game to play nowadays. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, you're basically a terrorist who is trying to blow up the President. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But in <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988> Japan, I guess it seemed far-fetched enough to be [pretty] much harmless. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can choose between these two characters: the imaginatively named Kunoichi and the even more imaginatively named Ninja. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You can also fool around with various settings (even changing the outfits). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, there is no difference in the, uh, characters other than [Kunoichi] having long hair hanging out the back of her ninja mask. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Both have the exact same movement, attacks, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, uh, quite frankly, Kunoichi doesn't even really look that feminine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Arcade "...Ninja Warriors" is a bit more interesting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You see, it was one of the, uh, relatively few games released by Taito in this insane widescreen format, which used mirrors and three monitors in this, uh, sort of, super wide cabinet. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One of the others was the first 'Darius' game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The widescreen effect makes the game visually interesting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the music is [pretty] good; it's by the Taito in-house band, Zuntata. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, it was still a [pretty] basic and repetitive Beat-'em-Up once you got over the impressive three-screen graphics. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "...Ninja Warriors" as your standard "Rush'n' Attack"-type game - a Stab-'em-Up, rather than a Beat-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Streams of uniformed soldiers come running at you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 For a robot assassin, your ninja is surprisingly un-bulletproof. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, it's lucky for you that almost no soldiers carry guns. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess the new evil President has instituted some sort of a racial segregation into the army, since it appears that black soldiers get knives and [only] the white guys get guns. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We also get a heavy dose of 'Terminator' thrown in. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You see, as your ninja takes damage your clothes and skin get stripped away, revealing the robot endoskeleton inside. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first boss is essentially the same sprite as you - but with a sword. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Enemies are, as I mentioned, very repetitive, but new types do appear, um, in the game, from time to time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You get attacked by dogs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, you know, it's never really fun to kill dogs in video games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But at least the P.C. Engine port does away with that really horrible pathetic whimper that you have in the Arcade version when you kill the dogs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 See? That's just so sad. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, you get guys who, sort of, lamely launch grenades at ya. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These guys can't even really be bothered to actually aim them at you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Later stages in... -- introduce some tougher enemies, but the P.C. Engine is actually missing some of the content from the Arcade game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Really, this is not one of the better ninja games we've seen, especially when compared to "Shinobi" or "Ninja Gaiden". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There was a, uh, superior Mega C.D. port, uh, which had some crazy extra content. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I suppose we'll cover that version in 'Chronsega' at some point. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Final Lap Twin 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 July 7 🇯🇵 // 1990 January [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Namco | Nova 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Namco 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 July is here and we're gonna finish off "<~Chrontendo~::[Chronturbo]> ... <Four::4>" with "Final Lap Twin" from Namco - a Racing Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There are various options available. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 First up, you have the basic Racing mode. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You pick a car, pick a track, and then off you go! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, regardless of whether or not you have one or two players, the screen is always like this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's in split screen mode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Final Lap..." is a lot like your typical "Pole Position"-type game - you know, an F-<One::1> Racing Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Just like, uh, every other Namco game today, this was based on Arcade game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though, in this case, "Final Lap Twin" is [only] vaguely connected to the <Nineteen-Eighty-Seven::1987> Arcade game, "Final Lap", which was a [pretty] much standard issue Racing [Game] with, uh, decent graphics. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I believe this was the first game to use the Namco System <Two::2> board, which would serve Namco [pretty] well up into the early <Nineties::'90s>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As we'll see, the two games are actually quite different, because there is a major addition to the home version. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For that, we'll need to check out the U.S. release for this extra content. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, aside from the standard Racing Game mode, there's also a Quest mode. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You enter your name, and then you get this intro. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Yep! "Final Lap Twin" is a Racing R.P.G. hybrid. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now, this [should] really come as no surprise. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Namco has already put out, uh, the Tennis R.P.G. game, "Pro Tennis: World Court". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That was back in August <Eighty-Eight::'88>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We saw it in "Chronturbo ... <Two::2>" and we've seen, sort of, similar Racing R.P.G. games in, uh, 'Chrontendo'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This works very much like "Pro Tennis: World Court". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you can imagine replacing tennis matches with F-<One::1> racing, you'll have the general idea. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Ya have several cities (these act sorta like, uh, R.P.G. villages), there [are] shops to buy upgrades to your car, N.P.C.s to give the hints, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, out on the main overworld, you will randomly encounter, uh, guys who want to race you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They appear, give their name, and ask if you want to race. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can say, 'No', but this doesn't always work, and they will often insist that you race [with] them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The races are [pretty] straightforward affairs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We have various track lay... -- layouts that repeat randomly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They get more difficult as the game progresses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 These tracks have these little ramps that you can drive over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In real life, this would, of course, result in injury and property damage. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But here they give you a little speed boost. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Memorizing the locations of these on any particular track is vital. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If you win, you will be awarded some prize money. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you lose, you're sent back to your father's house, which is, sort of, like the start point in the game, in the first village. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He'll give you some consolation money. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, even in losing, you still win a bit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so what do you do with all that money? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, you head to the shop and buy some parts - faster engines, better tires, lighter body, new brakes, et cetera. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You'll also need to buy fuel to replenish your Turbo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once your car is completely improved, you probably stand a [pretty] good chance against the area's boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This guy looks like such a goon! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 His car is also a lot faster than yours, so you'll need to perform [pretty] well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 He promises to give you what is ominously referred to as his "secret part" if you win. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Luckily, it turns out the secret part is just a teleportation device that you use to move between, uh, the cities you've already visited. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At this point, you just head on down to the next town, look around, find better parts, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The towns are all named after real cities. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here, for example, we reached 'Pallas'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 ([The] first town was 'Etroit'.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Final Lap Twin" is definitely a lot more developed as a game than that Namco Tennis R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The characters have a bit more personality, they often say silly or funny things, and somehow shopping for car parts is just more satisfying than buying better t-shirts or shoes, like in "Pro Tennis: World Court". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There are various little hidden extras in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, near the second town, you can accidentally get cursed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This will not [only] make the bosses refuse to race with you, but it'll also make your s... -- car sprite appear smaller while on the track. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At this point, you'll need to search around and find a way to ge..., uh, be uncursed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Sloppy Sue! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't even wanna know how she got that nickname. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Defeating the second boss gets you this, uh, rather sweet map here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Final Lap Twin" was developed by Nova, who did a lot of things for Namco. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And overall, it's reasonably well-done and colorful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I suppose this serves as further proof that by <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989> in Japan, anything that could be converted into R.P.G. form would be converted into R.P.G. form. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥉 Episode 4 Wrap Up… ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, folks, another <fifteen::15> games down! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We have some great stuff coming up next episode. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Let's take a moment to ponder what this episode's best game must be. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I... 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Wait a second! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What's going on? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I can't believe it! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We've got another game!.. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gunhed 🇯🇵 // Blazing Lazers 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 July 7 🇯🇵 // 1989 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Compile 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, folks, this is The One, right here - one of the best games on the system. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In Japan, it's called "Gunhed". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But in the U.S. we know it is "Blazing Lazers", which is a much better name than "Gunhed". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The [only] way they could have improved that name is to replace the final 'S' with another 'Z'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Other than having an uglier title screen, "Blazing Lazers" is about the same game as "Gunhed". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, what can we say here about this? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, first of all, it's awesome. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Just look how fast this is! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is basically your Blast Processing right here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 For those of you not familiar with "Blazing Lazers"<slash::/>"Gunhed", it is perhaps THE Shoot-'em-Up on the P.C. Engine - a system known for Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's one of those handful of games, such as "<Ease::Ys>", and, uh, "Castlevania: Rondo of Blood", and a few others that [pretty] much define the system. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you were going to name the top five P.C. Engine games, "Blazing Lazers" would almost certainly be on your list. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so what's the story here? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, it was published by Hudson in Japan and N.E.C. in the U.S., naturally. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, it was developed by Compile - those Shoot-'em-Up specialists who did, uh, "Zanac: Guardian Legend" on the Nintendo Entertainment System and "Power Strike" for the Master System. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Zanac..." was one of the best Shooters on the N.E.S. when it came out in <Nineteen-Eighty-Seven::1987>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was [pretty] progressive in its gameplay. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It offered a wide variety of power-ups and had interesting A.I. system that adjusted the difficulty, compared to how you were doing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Compile had also been putting out a number of, like, Shooters on M.S.X. computers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, all of this stuff kinda seems like a dry run for "Blazing Lazers", which took the basic ideas and gameplay of Compile's earlier games and wrapped it all up in a very slick package! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Blazing Lazers" is, [pretty] much, a winner in every department. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a fantastic-looking game, great graphics, everything is very detailed and cool-looking. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Richer colors, deep shadows - it just looks better than Compile's earlier games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The sound and the music is all fantastic. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are tons of objects and enemies are projectiles on the screen, at any given time, without slowdown or flicker. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you compare this to literally any other Shoot-'em-Up we've covered in the 'Chron...' series, you will see this is the most impressive-looking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, the name 'Blazing Lazers' is self-explanatory (uh, lasers blazing, of course). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But what about the Japanese title, "Gunhed"? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, the game is technically a licensed title. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Gunhed" was this Sci-Fi movie released right around the same time as the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It was directed by one Masato Harada, who might be somewhat recognizable as an actor in movies like "The Last Samurai". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He's mostly known as being a director in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He's made tons of movies, uh, most of which are actually of a serious variety. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He claims to have been mentored by the great American director, Howard Hawk, back in the <Seventies::'70s>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Harada seems to move back and forth between Japan and the West quite a lot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, he went to Skywalker Ranch to get Lucasfilm's help with "Gunhed" in the sound department, apparently. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, "Gunhed" as a movie is [pretty] ridiculous. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's about these (I don't know) Space Pirates or something(?) who are looking for valuable stuff in some abandoned futuristic factory or something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then most [of] the characters get killed, and the main guy finds a couple orphan kids, and a robot tank called "Gunhed", and the escape from the factory. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The movie is actually [pretty] terrible and boring. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, at first glance, it looks like it might be an entertaining cheesy movie. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it's not really bad in a fun way (like, something like "Star Crash"). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's more [pretty] dull. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the second half is mostly the main guy and the kid trying to operate the "Gunhed" mech. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It has some [pretty] elaborate set design and robots and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the movie looks terrible! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, it's poorly edited, and has very flat cinematography, and the style makes it look sorta like a direct-to-video movie. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I can't recommend the movie at all, but I would recommend ya check out one of the, uh, various trailers you can find on YouTube. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 (Though the trailer makes the movie look a lot more fun than it actually is.) 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 According to the director, the movie flopped in Japan, but supposedly has a cult following in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Despite being named after the movie, the game has absolutely nothing in common with it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You are controlling some sort of flying ship (not a tank) and the game takes place mostly in outer space (not a Cyberpunk-y factory on an island). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Looks like Hudson and Compile made absolutely no attempt to tie this in with the movie whatsoever, beyond putting the word 'Gunhed' on the title screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm willing to bet that development on this game was already well underway when Tohu came along with the, uh -- the "Gunhed" deal (much like Nintendo's "Doki Doki Panic"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, back to the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a typical Compile Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have a choice of four weapons (numbered, uh, one through four in Roman numerals). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can get a more powerful peashooter (um, of the sort often called a vulcan in video games). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a powerful laser, there's a Wave Beam type thing, and a rotating shield that goes around ya. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 My favorite is probably the Wave Beam. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And your weapon can be powered up more by shooting enemies and grabbing the little purple orbs they drop. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There's also a secondary power-up that enemies drop. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This will add a shield (which I have here), or homing missiles, or a "Gradius"-like Option or two. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then there's the 'F' power-up, which, sort of, improves your existing weapon in an interesting way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, the laser will twist and bend to attack enemies, as opposed to simply shooting a set pattern. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's entirely, uh, possible this was conceived as a sequel to Hudson's "Star Soldier". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This level with its huge number of destructible items on-screen reminds me a lot {of} "Star Soldier". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 After this, Hudson put out a few actual "Star Soldier" sequels that were clearly inspired by "Blazing Lazers". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Every level has a boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This one is a spider, for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 {I'm} not sure what a giant spider is doing in space or why it's shooting baby spiders at you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Using your own offspring as ammunition is probably not the best strategy for propagation of the species, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess that's why we don't really see any giant space spiders nowadays, huh. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The next level is a "LifeForce"-inspired organic level, where you shoot at floating brains and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It might be kind of hard to see in this video, but, uh, the large on-screen color palette really comes in handy here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Uh... For example, examining the background, you'll see it's basically, um, a bunch of red nerve endings coming up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there's a total of eight colors ranging from purple to orange hues, t... -- plus black, gray, and white. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Even simple things like the little Wave Beams have three shades of blue plus white. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The P.C. Engine did have great color and Compile really takes full advantage of it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This level's boss is sort of an odd-looking creature - like a vagina dentata-looking mouth. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The next level is, visually speaking, the least interesting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's actually similar to what you might have seen in "Zanac" - desert level full of pyramids. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 For the first few levels, "Blazing Lazers" is [pretty] easy and your ship kinda feels overpowered. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Starting on the organic level and continuing to the desert level, certain parts get a little hectic. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Occasionally, you'll have, like, just tons and tons of enemies on-screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But after this, it does get a little bit more difficult. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The next level is, again, set in space and adds some very fast moving enemies, which will obliterate you if you aren't paying attention. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then, once again, we have these very nicely done background objects with, uh, each of those iceberg-like things containing about six shades of blue. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Wave Beam, here, is not fully powered up, but you can see the special upgrade obtained by collecting the 'F' power-up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There're waves that fire from behind, then turn around, and then fire upward. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Different weapons may come in handy in different situations. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, during this boss, the laser it powered up is [pretty] useful for clearing out those little spiky projectiles the boss fires. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, the next level is where things take a *massive* jump in difficulty. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This level resembles the first level with tons more turrets and ports shooting projectiles at ya. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Meaning there'll be stuff coming at you from multiple directions at once. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Luckily, you can take a few hits but this will downgrade your weapon, and the shield will take a few hits before it goes kaput. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the last few levels, you will be hit on a regular basis. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, there is a desperate need to constantly repl... -- replenish the shield and weapons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Luckily, ya have plenty of bombs and lives, but you will *need* those, um, for the last couple {of} levels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's an example of where the game makes you, uh, have to be a bit flexible. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Wave Beam thing is completely useless against this guy! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you want... -- you want something, instead, that shoots straight up and can hit the ports when they're uncovered. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, you might have to change weapons during this boss battle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Next up is the bubbles level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I started out not very well-prepared. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I lost the laser weapon and was [pretty] much screwed, until I squeaked by long enough, uh, to rearm myself with sufficient weaponry. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And, seriously, the last couple {of} levels [of] this game have some [pretty] serious white knuckle moments. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The final level is a boss rush with some stupidly hard waves of enemies in between bosses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, what exactly makes "Blazing Lazers" so great? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, it's just one of those games that hits every single note that it needs to. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The graphics are exceptional, the music is catchy (but not distracting), it's difficult but not cheap, all the weapons and power-ups are useful in their own way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Many Shoot-'em-Ups have, like, one level that ya hate. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the one that always feels unfair or irritating. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Blazing Lazers" doesn't really have anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, none of the levels are so long that they get boring. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the game isn't so short that ya feel cheated. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once again, it's an excellent game and one of the best P.C. Engine/<Turbo-Graphics::TurboGrafx>... games and probably the best Shoot-'em-Up we've seen on any of the 'Chron...' series, not to mention one of Compile's best games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The final boss is a computer resembling the, uh, main computer from the movie, "Tron", who turns into a woman here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The whole 'woman computer' thing kinda reminds me of "Phantasy Star <Two::II>" actually. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The boss has a third form: a spaceship that you can [only] damage while the hatch is open. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, overall, "Gunhed"<slash::/>"Blazing Lazers" is an <A-PLUS::A+> game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, uh, we'll actually end this with the game's outro. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 4 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Alright then, another episode down and a few more hundred to go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Best Game in this episode? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Do you even have to ask? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is there any doubt whatsoever? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yes, of course, it's "Blazing Lazers". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 How could I not choose this game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's one of the all-time top <Turbo-Graphics-Sixteen::TurboGrafx-16> titles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Worst Game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, I don't know... uh, "Energy", I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's certainly the least competent game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But I don't really feel completely good about this choice because the music is so totally rad! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 My alternate choice might be, uh, "Jinmu Denshou...". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Again, the music is [pretty] decent and the game is... awful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Next up will be another "Chrontendo...", but "Chronturbo ... <Five::5>" (when it eventually comes out) will cover the rest of Summer <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>, with a few more C.D.-ROM games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There will be another Capcom title and two ports of Sega-originated games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's also gonna be a new publisher, Micro Cabin, as well as more stuff from Hudson, Namco, N.C.S., and the usual guys. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 See ya then! 🍇🍌
