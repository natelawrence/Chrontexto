👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 50 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hello, everyone, and welcome to the very special <FIFTIETH::50th> episode of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, when I say 'special' I mean it's going to be especially bad because we have an egregiously awful selection of games today: terrible Game Show adaptations from Rare, multiple Baseball Games, a Mahjong Game, and an intriguing (yet severely flawed) game from Tose. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Due to the high frequency of s... -- total stinkers, this time around, I've thrown in the <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> Computer Game Round-Up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We had the <EIGHTY-NINE::'89> Arcade Game Round-Up a few episodes back. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So we're gonna take a look at the other side of gaming in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>: the world of Computer games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, with no further ado, let's get started where we left off last time: in mid-October <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kattobi! Warabe Ko 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 October 20 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Pack-in-Video
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pack-in-Video 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You guys don't normally see this but F.D.S. games take a bit [of] time to load up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I normally edit out the loading times when I put these videos together. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [pretty] weird; we went months without any F.D.S. games and now suddenly we have two that came out within a week of each other. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not sure why this was even released on the F.D.S. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Pack-In-Video didn't put out tons of stuff on disk ([only] this and one other game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Pack-In... was much more fond of carts. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here we have a very obscure game that no one seems to even know how to, uh, transliterate the title. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's known as, uh, "Kattobi! Warabe Ko", "Kattobi! Dōji", and "Kattobi! Warabe Ji". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We have a lot of different Baseball Games this episode, but fortunately this one is a little different than most. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, it's based on a manga. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Kattobi! Warabe Ko" was serialized in a monthly magazine, called 'Koro Koro'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The comic ran from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987> to <NINETEEN-NINETY::1990>. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Koro Koro' is aimed at younger readers and has a lot of comics based on existing properties, nowadays, like Pokémon, Kirby, Mario, and (quite recently) Yokai Watch. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Kattobi!" was a humorous baseball drama comic and the protagonist, Sarutobi, has a ninja background or something and uses these ninja abilities in baseball. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose you really can't get any more Japanese videogamey than combining ninjas and baseball. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, first you've got to pick where to go; these are other schools, I believe. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you pick you opponents, you choose your starter and then the game begins. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 F---! This looks like Intellivision Baseball! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, now this is [pretty] weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We have a couple card-based games this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, you don't control your players directly like you do in every other Baseball Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All the batting, pitching, et cetera is done automatically. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What you do is choose cards to play. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's kinda weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your players look like little kids and the other dude looks, like, <THIRTY::30>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure this is all explained in the comic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, the exact mechanics of this are not really clear to me, but the cards all have four spaces, filled with "M"s, "J"s, "B"s, or a blank space. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a number. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm the batter right now. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I choose a card and then the pitcher selects a card. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If the -- the ball on the pitcher's card matches a blank space on your card, you strike. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Otherwise you get a hit of some sort. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, I got a foul. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "J"s seem to be better than "M"s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When the ball lines up with a letter, the numbers below, sort of, count down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, I clearly beat the pitcher and got to second base. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Somehow the power levels of the opposing players factor in as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, I managed to get a base hit and Sarutobi reached the home plate. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 When you're pitching, you choose a card [of] the ball in a certain position and number. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Depending on what the batter chose, you may get a strike or a hit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure the strategy is a bit deeper than what I'm picking up, but this is surprisingly easy to play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Little kids love card games (as you undoubtedly are aware) so I suppose this kinda makes sense [a...] -- as a game aimed at a younger audience. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I won't say this is necessarily a great game but at least it's different than every other single Baseball Game we've seen so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Softball Tengoku 🇯🇵 // Dusty Diamond's All-Star Softball 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 October 27 🇯🇵 // 1990 July [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pack-in-Video 🇯🇵 //  🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, we are onto the final week of October - getting so close to <NINETEEN-NINETY::1990>. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now here's a weird one - Tonkin House's "Softball Tengoku" (or 'Softball Heaven') developed by Tose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you had the U.S. version of this game when you were a kid, it must have really messed with your little minds. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The overall theme of "Softball Tengoku" is, 'finally a Baseball Game for furries!'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It makes you choose the field first. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each field has a slightly different size and characteristic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some have obstacles like patches of weeds and puddles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This shows you the rules, which can actually vary from field to field. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And holy cow! What a roster to pick from! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the main way in which "Softball Tengoku" differs from most other Baseball Games is the roster. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have sixty players to choose from, which include animals, monsters, seemingly normal-looking humans. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a ninja, an eyeball, a kappa - all kinds of crazy players which have different strengths and weaknesses (and some have special abilities). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You then choose your name, batting order, positions, and so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In terms of how it plays, for the most part it works like any other such game, but with a number of twists. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It is softball, so softball rules apply to some extent. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, here, there is a Home Run line so a ball that lands outside that line is automatically a Home Run. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yes, and when you hit a homer, your team lines up at the home plate and brings you a bouquet of flowers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are a good deal of weird little touches and surprises like that in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Honestly, there is so much fun stuff in here that, even though this is a Tose game, I really can't hate it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... Playing this for the first time, there's all kinds of, sort of, 'Oh s---!' moments. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Check out this pitcher. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Then, in July <NINETEEN-NINETY::1990>, Brøderbund released an altered version of this in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now this game is [pretty] weird for a Baseball Game, but the way Brøderbund released it is actually a little odd. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most (but not all) of the non-human players have been changed to regular human beings, though we still have, uh, Zelda the witch and Diablo the demon-looking guy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And some [of] the humans do look kinda weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the manual actually gave descriptions of them, as well as list their names. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, the frog player in the Japanese version is now a person, but is named "Froggy". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 According to the manual, uh, Chuck's full name is, "Chuck 'can I pay ya next Tuesday' Silver". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, the manual actually does go into quite a bit of detail on the entire roster. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, they added a new mode: Slow Pitch, which changes the rules a bit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And for some reason on the fields, whe... -- whenever there are spectators in the backgrounds, those are still animals. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They didn't bother changing those to be humans. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And we have this marvelous screen which looks like it's made up entirely of clip art. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, despite being this nutty magical-themed game, the box art made it look like... sort of, like an all-dad softball league. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... {It's} really great box art, but doesn't go with the game at all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And they renamed it "Dusty Diamond's All-Star Softball". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You know, I'm, uh, <NINETY-NINE-PERCENT::99%> sure "Dusty Diamond" is, uh, completely made up for this game but the box and manual claim he's a legendary softball all-star. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, for some reason, um, they actually tie the game into Ernest Thayer's <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> baseball poem, "Casey at the Bat", with this game, uh, purportedly taking place in Mudville. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The team names are all funny. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, I'm playing as the "Dweebs". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for some reason, the bit where your teammates give you flowers when you hit a Home Run has been removed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, {for} the most part, this actually handles reasonably well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Seems like there are less foul balls in the U.S. version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's kind of crudely made, in some ways. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the variety in the playing fields and the huge and unusual roster is what actually makes it fun to play. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like I mentioned, certain players have special abilities. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... Some fields have puddles of water and Froggy can easily run through these. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Other players can't. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some pitchers can do wild curve balls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy can actually fly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And quite a few players are [pretty] much completely worthless. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In <TWO::2>-Player mode, part of the game is scrambling to choose the best players. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Since you don't take turns choosing them, you can choose a whole bunch as quickly as you can move your controller around. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So then the person who knows the roster the best, could really very quickly end up with a huge advantage over the other person. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd say that, in terms of pure goofy fun, in a Baseball Game, this one is actually [pretty] hard to beat. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tashiro Masashi no Princess ga Ippai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 October 27 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Epic Sony Records 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next up, we have {a} rather bizarre Action Platforming game from Epic Sony Records: "Tashiro Masashi no Princess ga Ippai" (or, roughly, 'Masashi Tashiro Has So Many Princesses'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this was developed, unfortunately, by Tose. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So this is yet another game starring a Japanese comedian, of sorts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Masashi Tashiro was a member of the blackface comedy musical group, "Rats and Star". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After leaving the band, he was discovered by Ken Shimura, who helped him get into T.V. comedy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, yes, it is that Ken Shimura, of "Kato-chan and Ken-chan" fame. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Tashiro's waning years would end up with him getting arrested for multiple attempts at voyeurism, attempting to film up women's skirts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, he was caught with a small amount of meth and weed (apparently a very serious crime in Japan) and, uh, he spent a few years in prison, becoming [pretty] much a pariah in the entertainment world, for some time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Back in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, however, he was cool enough to get his own video game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily we have a very high quality translation here, from the group Suicidal Translations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They've chosen the name "Princesstual Orgy" for this (obviously a somewhat loose translation of the title). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Despite the name, this game is actually quite family friendly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as you'll recall, in the outro of last episode, I mentioned I was looking forward to this because, with the utterly absurd name, I have been curious as to what this could actually be. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I even assumed this would be the highlight of the episode and... holy s--- was I ever wrong. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is a hot flaming pile of dog crap and I really, really hated this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, in theory it doesn't look too bad, but wait until we get into it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is to rescue four princesses, who are displayed 'Mega Man'-style on a stage select screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each of the <four::4> levels is a [pretty] standard Action Platformer-type thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It actually reminds me a bit of the "Kato-chan and Ken-chan" game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You're armed with some sort of yo-yo, I believe, used to kill enemies who will drop hearts to refill your health. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most enemies take off ten points of health. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's good that you have so much health; otherwise you would never finish this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Levels always have these d---ed underground sections. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It turns out you're not supposed to go down those holes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They just lead to this area, which is where you, uh, need to backtrack - almost all the way to the beginning of the level, in order to find the exit from the underground. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you retrace your steps through the upper part of the level again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The underground level is generally used as, sort of, like, a punishment for missing a jump or falling off a platform or something like that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And Lord knows you'll be falling off platforms a lot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game has some of the worst platforming I've ever encountered; it is infuriating. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You know how games will throw in, like, one of, you know, those jumps - the ones where jumping one pixel too early or one too late will cause you to fall to your death? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is full of those! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It tends to place blocks right above your head, so jumping a teensy bit too soon will cause you to hit your head and, uh, fall down. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This section occurs [pretty] early in this level and holy crap! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If anyone playing the original cart didn't give up right here, then I'm amazed at their persistence. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game goes instantly from super-easy platforming to, like, "Mega Man (<ONE::1>)" Yellow Devil-style, just like that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, the disappearing block section in "Mega Man" is a cakewalk, compared to this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of the frustration isn't really due to the layout of the platforms as it is the controls and mechanics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Masashi, himself, is really sluggish. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He accelerates slowly, and yet is really hard to stop, once he starts moving. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's hard to explain, unless you've actually played the game, but he feels like he's, like, weighs five tons... and the ground feels like a newly waxed floor. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He has this really obnoxious momentum that makes him hard to start. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, once you try to stop (say, when you're landing on a platform) it's super easy to just slide right off. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, trust me, the second you start this game, you'll, uh, try moving him around and you'll be, like, 'Holy crap! I hate this!'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The FamiCom version was actually the second one to come out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It was, uh, first released, a bit earlier in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, for the M.S.X. <TWO::2>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This version was developed by HAL Laboratory, of all people. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... Who knows? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe Iwata, himself, worked on this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character, here, is very light and floaty and I'm not sure this is really that much better than the FamiCom game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are some obvious differences, like the lack of scrolling, but it's very clearly the same game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, at the end of each level, you'll enter a castle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to find your way through the castle to the room where some friendly character gives you a crystal, which unlocks the door to the boss' room. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So first you get the crystal, then find your way to the boss' room, and then you'd fight the boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this would be a lot better if every room didn't look more or less the same. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Boss fights are [pretty] lame; they just fly around, uh, throwing stuff at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... And all the bosses are [pretty] much exactly the same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once the boss is defeated, the princess will drop down from the framed portrait on the wall and you'll need to <~ecscape~::[escape]> the castle before it blows up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You then return to the title screen and repeat. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Now, Dr. Sparkle', you say, 'Um... This thing looks like a mostly harmless run-of-the-mill Platformer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean you've played countless games like this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just why do you hate this one so much?'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, you know, I don't kn... -- really know. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just like there's so many little annoying things this game does wrong. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like this, uh, terrible water level where enemies just appear right in front of you, or when the vents at the bottom of the screen suck you down and you need to go back to the level's beginning again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or these stupid, boring, and repetitive castle levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the fact that you fight a slight variation of the same boss four times in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Or the stupid jumping and horrible controls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Did you see that? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What did I hit my head on? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Or maybe it's just the sheer number of really really frustrating jumps, scattered randomly around the levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The way the levels are laid out is just weird! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There'll be long stretches of just, sort of, walking forward where nothing happens; you can easily pick off enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then you suddenly get something that's, like, almost guaranteed to kill you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a lot of very irritating enemy placement {and} level design. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... Possibly the castles {are} the most obvious examples of this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Om... You know, I am not a game designer, but it seems to me, if I were making a maze level like this, I would not make every room look almost exactly the same, because it makes exploring castles as monotonous as hell. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And also, since you move down each floor, using these slowly descending platforms, the way the enemies are placed means you will often get hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The enemies often walk right up to you, just as the platform has descended enough to actually try to shoot them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So enemies generally walk right into you, as the <~FLAT-FORM~::[platform]> is being lowered. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The extremely wonky jumping means that it's very easy to fail to make certain jumps when trying to escape before the timer runs out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And also, I mean, if, for some reason it's absolutely necessary to have a situation where you freeze mid-jump while the screen scrolls vertically, I would try to use these -- these situations sparingly, as opposed to using them constantly, like this game does in the castle area. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another irritating thing: you have a few seconds of -- of invulnerability after taking a hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But they make it so that, while you're blinking and invulnerable, you can't pick up the health refills, which often float away before you gain the ability to actually touch them again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So after rescuing the fourth princess, you are told you must kill the Ultra Witch, in order to restore peace. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The final (and rather short) level is suddenly from a top-down perspective and now you have to figure out how to do the timing on this new style of jumping. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Check this out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 See how slippery and floaty my character is? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually hard to line up with that door. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so at last the final battle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a brief series of "...Zelda"-style rooms and then the witch, herself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The ending will change, depending on which dialogue choice you pick. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you choose the "Give up" option, you'll get this ending, where she allows you to rule with her and you can marry one of the princesses (but [only] one, for some reason). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Calling her a b---- or flirting with her will trigger the final battle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So you fire off a few shots at her and then she transforms into a huge dragon-type beast. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... Now, nothing in this game (no matter how bad) had prepared me for this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You might look at this and wonder what's going on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The, uh, floor is so slippery during this fight that it's next to impossible to control your character or -- or actually aim in the right direction. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the boss' projectiles will spin you in different directions so it's d--- near impossible to actually aim your weapon at the boss' head. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually best to use a weapon like the Earth one that fires out projectiles in a wide pattern. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so once you've defeated the boss, you'll get the good ending. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a shame this is so aggravating to play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it looks [pretty] nice for the most part; we've seen far far uglier stuff on the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I was hoping, uh, this would be a far more polished game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yes, and in the ending, we get... Rats and Star! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Choujin Ultra Baseball 🇯🇵 // Baseball Simulator 1.000 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 October 27 🇯🇵 // 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Culture Brain
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Culture Brain 🇯🇵 // Culture Brain U.S.A. 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hell of a logo, there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Very cool! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We have a new game from Culture Brain, "Choujin Ultra Baseball", which could be translated as 'Superhuman Ultra Baseball', which is actually kind of like "Softball Tengoku". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once again, you can choose between several fields (a few of which are quite fanciful) and players have certain abilities called ultra moves, which generally involve various cool animations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can imagine, this is a bit prettier-looking than "Softball Tengoku" and feels a bit more polished. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, just as with "Softball Tengoku", we got a rather strange localization that wasn't very appropriate for such an unusual game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Choujin Ultra Baseball" was released in the U.S. in <NINETEEN-NINETY::1990>, under the name "Baseball Simulator <ONE-THOUSAND::1,000>" (or, rather, "Baseball Simulator <ONE-DOT-ZERO-ZERO-ZERO::1.000>"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some [of] the graphics used in the game's intro and menu have been changed, but other than that it's mostly the same. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The name "Baseball Simulator <ONE-THOUSAND::1,000>" makes it sound like a dry stats-heavy Computer game - and there is a little bit of that element. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The teams are editable, you can name them, name the players, and play a whole <HUNDRED-'N'-FIFTY-FIVE::155> game season. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the special abilities are really downplayed on the game's packaging, whereas in Japan that element was the main selling feature. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So you can play totally straight baseball, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Atlantic League and the Northern League feature teams that reference real life teams in a very non-infringing sort of way, but these teams have no special abilities. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Ultra League teams do. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just look at this dude! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Playing with a regular league, this gives you a [pretty] standard Baseball Game experience, right down to an, uh, A.I. that easily catches every fly ball you hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When using the Ultra League team, however, you can activate your ultra moves, as long as you have some available Ultra Points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This one stuns a, uh, the opposing team's fielder when they try to catch the ball. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Getting a Home Run causes the camera to pan up and over the bleachers and you can see the game's background at this point (which varies, depending on the stadium you selected). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is nowhere as weird as "Softball Tengoku" and -- and doesn't really have that game's, uh, loony charm. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's certainly different than your typical <EIGHTIES::'80s>, uh, <EIGHT::8>-bit Baseball Game, but I really didn't find it to be that mind-blowing. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dragon Ball 3: Gokuuden 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 October 27 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ohhh boy. It's time for a 'Dragon Ball' game, "Dragon Ball <THREE::3>: Gokuuden". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This one has all your favorite 'Dragon Ball' characters in it, like... the pig, the old guy with the beard, and that green dude (I think his name is "Piccolo"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like the first three 'Dragon Ball' games, this was published by Bandai and developed by our good friends Tose. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first 'Dragon Ball' game was released in the U.S. as "Dragon Power". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was a Top-Down Action Game and, uh, the next one, "Dragon Ball: Daimaou Fukkatsu" added [an] almost Adventure Game-style interface, but it was really more of an R.P.G. and introduced a card-based fighting system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Dragon Ball <THREE::3>..." builds on the system a bit and gives the world layout a bit more of a Board Game feel. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here's how it works: you do almost everything in this game by using those cards, below. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You move by selecting a card. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The number of spaces you move is based on the number of dots in the upper left corner of each card. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you pick a five and that'll allow you to move five spaces. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, even though your destination is determined by the card that you choose, you have to manually use the D-Pad to move Goku each space. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can't cheat by moving back a space and then forward a space or anything. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, having the player move Goku after a card's been picked is completely extraneous. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's just busywork. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know why Goku isn't, like, automatically moved to the correct space, after you select a card. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And he moves really slowly, so I guess the whole thing is to, kind of, stretch the game's length out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Battles are also fought using cards. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The idea is similar to the last game, but the layout, designs, and the animations have been updated. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya pick several cards to play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your cards are then played, uh, one at a time, against the enemy's cards. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If the number of dots on your card is higher than the enemy's, you will attack him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If his card is higher, you will defend against his attacks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each card has a defense stat as well; it's the number on the bottom right of each card. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If your turn is first, you get [to] choose how many cards to play: one to five. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if you choose three, you pick three cards and the enemy picks three cards. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The battles look quite nice. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The characters are well-drawn and the animations are charming. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's really a huge step up from the butt-ugly graphics of the first 'Dragon Ball' game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Other than battles, you'll find mini-games, areas where you talk to other characters from the series, even annoying first-person mazes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it's not strictly linear; there are intersections along the game path. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You might need to head off in one direction to Level Up [before] heading off in another direction. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Dragon Ball <THREE::3>..." is basically an R.P.G. with seriously altered mechanics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's various objects you can get in the game, such as health-restoring items, but cards also take the place of weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Various special cards will unleash powerful attacks. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While "Dragon Ball <THREE::3>..." might not exactly be a great game at least it's kind of mixed up the usual FamiCom R.P.G. formula up a bit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's also worth pointing out that, by this time, even quickie cash-in games, from the likes of Bandai, looked semi-decent. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... Bandai and Tose had come quite a long way from the hastily-produced junk they turned out in great quantities in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987> and <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of all the FamiCom 'Dragon Ball' games, this is the [only] one that's not completely translated into English so it might be difficult to play and I probably really wouldn't recommend it, but at least it doesn't look too crappy. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Major League 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 October 27 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Lenar
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Words you'd never expect to see: Lenar is an author. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our fourth (that's right, fourth) and final (I hope) Baseball Game today is "Major League": published by Irem, released in Japan [only]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Play ball!" 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Morgan Creek and Mirage are the production companies that made "Major League" the movie. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, yes, this is, bizarrely enough, a licensed video game, based on the <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> movie, "Major League", starring Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So this is the second Nintendo system game based on a Charlie Sheen movie (after "Platoon"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The movie was directed by David Ward, who's probably most well-known for writing <NINETEEN-SEVENTY-THREE::1973>'s "The Sting", starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman, which he won an Oscar for the script. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Major League" is a completely fictional story about the Cleveland Indians. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it was a decent-sized hit in the U.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm guessing it did well in Japan as well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's interesting that they acquired the rights to the name "Major League" and then released a totally generic Baseball Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, once you get past the introduction, and start the game, itself, this is just <ONE-HUNDRED-PERCENT::100%> regular old Baseball Video Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's absolutely nothing here (as far as I can tell) that we haven't seen in at least the last three dozen Baseball Games we've covered on 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [pretty] much <ONE-HUNDRED-PERCENT::100%> par for the course, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Lenar, the developer, we've encountered a few times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most notably, they developed "Bird Week" from June <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SIX::1986> (that oddball Bird Simulation Game) and, most notoriously, they made "Deadly Towers" (a game which was, uh, much-hated by Seanbaby). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's odd; "Bird Week" seemed like a very early FamiCom game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I covered it in, uh, f---ing "Chrontendo Episode <EIGHT::8>". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's how long ago it was, and yet today we're looking at a game that came out a mere three and a half years later. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 From "Bird Week" to "Major League" seems like eons in video game time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, "Bird Week" came out right after "Dragon Quest". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And now, in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, we've seen countless "Dragon Quest" clones. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The genre had already become like a cliche' on the FamiCom - so much has changed in the video game world in those three years. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But what's changed between <TWO-THOUSAND-THIRTEEN::2013> and now? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, what came out in <TWO-THOUSAND-THIRTEEN::2013>? "Resident Evil <SIX::6>"? "Animal Crossing: New Leaf"? "Antichamber"? "Monaco"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not much different than what we have today. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, of all the Baseball Games this episode, it's interesting that this one (the one based on a movie) turned out to be the [only] one that didn't totally deviate from the standard generic Baseball Video Game formula. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {I} can't say this is really worth playing, but, um, at the very least it has some, kind of, cool graphics depicting the movie characters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's probably the [only], uh, worthwhile thing in "Major League" the game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mahjong Taikai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 October 31 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?]
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Koei 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey! Good news: A Mahjong Game from Koei - our last game of October <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think this is the first Koei game we've seen that isn't some kind of, like, Military Strategy Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I also think it's been at least a couple months since we've seen a Mahjong Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, here's "Mahjong Taikai". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, we've seen countless Mahjong Games in 'Chrontendo' so far. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The difference here is you can play mahjong against historical figures, of course... since it's a Koei game (Odu Nomunaga, Cleopatra, Napoleon...). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It all makes perfect sense. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is actually a port of a game Koei originally released for the <P.C.-NINETY-EIGHT::PC-98> in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, uh, 'MobyGames' says <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-FIVE::1985>, which I think is incorrect. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you might know, there's countless variations on the rules for mahjong. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 How mahjong, uh, is played varies a lot from country to country. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can control quite a few of the rules here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This menu allows you to turn on or off certain rules. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Other than the general absurdity of important people from history somehow traveling through time and getting together in order to play a few rounds of mahjong, there's really not that much to say about "Mahjong Taikai". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's main historical importance is that this is one of the very few FamiCom games Koei released that wasn't some kind of Military Strategy Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# ☰ The Chrontendo 1989 Computer Game Round-Up [Index ⮟] ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Since it's sort of a slow episode, in terms of N.E.S. games, I figured this would be a perfect opportunity to squeeze in the <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> Computer Game Round-Up. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Intro: Computer Platforms of the Era ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 The late <EIGHTIES::'80s> and early <NINETIES::'90s> were, sort of, a strange transitional time for the world of computer gaming. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The older computers (the Apple, the Commodore <SIXTY-FOUR::64>, the Atari <EIGHT::8>-bit computers) were virtually dead. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The <SIXTEEN::16>-bit computers of the mid-'80s, such as the Atari S.T. and the Commodore Amiga had enjoyed some success, but were clearly on their way out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, the computer wars were completely finished. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I.B.M. clones (or P.C.s) which had begun to dominate the market around <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-FIVE::1985> had achieved a marketshare of over <EIGHTY-PERCENT::80%> by <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Macintosh, the Amiga, Atari S.T., and the Commodore <SIXTY-FOUR::64> were all, sort of, fighting over the remaining sliver of the pie. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By the early <NINETIES::'90s>, it was just down to P.C. versus Mac (at least in the United States). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Amiga and the S.T. managed to hold on, uh, in the U.K. and Europe for a few more years. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, at this point DOS was the dominant operating system for computer gaming. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 V.G.A. graphics and sound cards were becoming more common in P.C.s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, while the Amiga had previously held a huge advantage in the graphics and sound department, the difference wasn't nearly as noticeable by <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Part 1: Adventure Games ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, of course <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> was smack-dab in the middle of the golden age of Adventure Games, so let's start by looking at that genre. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sierra had been the major publisher in graphic Adventure Games since the mid-'80s and continued to pump these things out at a [pretty] high rate. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Leisure Suit Larry III ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Al Lowe's "Leisure Suit Larry <THREE::III>: Passionate Patti In Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals" used Sierra's S.C.I. engine, first introduced in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "...Larry <THREE::III>..." cranks up the lewdness, in comparison to the previous game; they're actually throwing bare boobs at the player. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It also allows you to control a second character for a while, Patti. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As with all the S.C.I. games, you type in text commands and spend a lot of time guessing what to do (as well as trying to figure out which typed commands will actually work). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Hero's Quest // Quest For Glory ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Sierra didn't release a 'King's Quest' game in <EIGHTY-NINE::'89>, but they did kick off a new series, 'Hero's Quest: So You Wanna Be a Hero'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though the series name was changed from 'Hero's Quest' to 'Quest For Glory' when another company claimed ownership of the name, 'Hero's Quest'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Created by the husband and wife team of Lori Ann Cole and Corey Cole, it was sorta like a more complicated take on 'King's Quest', adding in R.P.G. elements like character stats and combat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's definitely a Sierra game at heart, though, and the series produced five games - the last being in <NINETEEN-NINETY-EIGHT::1998>. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Codename: Iceman ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Codename: Iceman" was a one-off design by Jim Walls (same guy who did "Police Quest"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a bit of a mess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As, uh, Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming <ONE-O-ONE::101> says, it's one third Adventure Game, one third Submarine Simulation Game, and one third reading comprehension test. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You're a completely blatant James Bond rip-off character, who starts the game vacationing on the beach. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is unique among Sierra games, in that your first order of business is to play beach volleyball, hit up the ladies in the bar, and, yes, get laid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If nothing else, we at least get this wonderful dancing scene. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Colonel's Bequest ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Yet another new series (though a short-lived one) debuted with the first Laura Bow game, "The Colonel's Bequest". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Get it? 'Bequest', because their games all have 'quest' in them?) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This Roberta Williams game was, uh, an update on "Mystery House" and, uh, sort of, an old-fashioned Murder Mystery Game, set in the golden age of Hollywood. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 With its referencing real life individuals like Gloria Swanson and Clara Bow, the game looks fantastic but, like so many other Sierra games, it can be unnecessarily obtuse at points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A sequel was made in <NINETEEN-NINETY-ONE::1991>. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Manhunter 2 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 One of Sierra's greatest d--- series was "Manhunter". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first one took place in New York, but "Manhunter <TWO::2>" is one of, um, several games this episode we'll see that's set in San Francisco. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like the first one, it uses a totally different engine than most of the other Sierra games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You travel around on an overworld map and use a mouse to interact with the world. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's, uh, bizarre, creepy, a bit gory, and (like so many other Sierra games) [pretty] d--- irritating at times. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 LucasArts was always much less prolific than Sierra and their sole Adventure Game in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> was Ron Gilbert's "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not the most loved of LucasArts' Adventure Games, "Indiana Jones..." unwisely introduces some action mechanics, in the form of fighting sequences. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a lot more dialogue and plot structure than "Maniac Mansion" or "Zack McCracken...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's certainly not as irritating as your typical Sierra game, but not in the same league as the two games LucasArts would produce in <NINETEEN-NINETY::1990>. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Personal Nightmare ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 From British company, Horror Soft, (later known as Adventure Soft, producer of "The Feeble Files" and "Simon the Sorcerer") is "Personal Nightmare", for which the likes of, uh, Elvira was licensed, for some reason... and which some sources bizarrely call one of the first Survival Horror Games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, it's one of those games that makes you wish you could travel back in time and slap the people who made it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If Hell had a game library, this is probably the [only] Adventure Game that would be in it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are virtually no clues as to what to do, very little enter... -- interaction with the game characters, not being in the right place at the right time for certain events will cause you to end up in an un-winnable situations, most of the deaths just happen completely unexpectedly, {and} the interface is clunky. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Naturally, British game mag, 'Zzap!', gave it <EIGHTY-SEVEN::87> out of <A-HUNDRED::100>. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At least some of the death sequences do look [pretty] cool. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Mean Streets ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 The least likely Adventure Game series to debut in <EIGHTY-NINE::'89> was 'Tex Murphy', from Bruce Carver and Access Software, straight out of S.L.C.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Carver and Access are mostly known for creating the, uh, 'Links' Golf Games (of which there were about a thousand or so entries in the series). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, uh, "Mean Streets" was the first 'Tex Murphy' game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] fancy-looking Adventure Game, which features V.G.A. graphics, digitized character art, and even <THREE::3>-D sequences where you fly around in your hover car. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Mean Streets" is not exactly great, but at least has a part where a character can get kicked in the nuts by this chick, if you're not careful. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Keef the Thief ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 So many terrible forgotten Adventure Games came out, around this time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One of them is "Keef the Thief", which I believe is the first game by Naughty Dog to actually use the name 'Naughty Dog' anywhere on the packaging. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was published by E.A., so this is the game that began Naughty Dog's ascent to massive success. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is a goofy parody of "King's Quest"-type games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It looks nice and has some decent music, but there's a reason why barely anyone has heard of this, today. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Future Wars ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another game from a developer that would later go on to bigger things was "Future Wars" - a very early title from Delphine, designed by Paul Cuisset. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later, these guys would go on to make "Flashback" and, uh, "Shaq-Fu". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But "Future Wars" (which has a great-looking intro, by the way) is a Point-and-Click Adventure Game and one that's irritating from the get-go. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like early Sierra games, it gives no hints or direction. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, also, there's no hint of plot or motivation at this point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You, uh, move forward, here, by filling up a bucket of water and booby-trapping the door, so that your boss gets drenched when he opens the door. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But why would you even want to do this? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's no way you could possibly guess that doing this would allow you to move into the next room. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 How can you even place a pail filled with water, on a closed door? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It -- It doesn't even make any sense. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, soon you end up in -- wandering into a teleporter, which sends you backwards in time and [then] a Sci-Fi plot kicks in, but it's not [exactly] the best-designed Adventure Game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸KULT: The Temple of Flying Saucers // Chamber of the Sci-Mutant Priestess ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Much less typical is the really weird "KULT: The Temple of ~the~ Flying Saucers" or "Chamber of the <~Sci-Fi ~::{Sci-}>Mutant Priestess", developed by another French company, Exxos. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You wander through a temple solving various bizarre puzzles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It reminds me a bit of "Shadowgate" or "MYST", but much stranger. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from the normal ways of interacting with the world, you have these various psychic abilities. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can read minds, for example, and you can also engage in combat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A very strange game in every regard, but it does show that Adventure Games could deviate substantially from the normal Sierra and LucasArts ideas. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸It Came From the Desert ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not quite sure what category to put this in, but <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> saw another one from Cinemaware, "It Came From the Desert". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Cinemaware caused a huge splash in <EIGHTY-SIX::'86> with "Defender of the Crown", but was actually on its last legs, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It would go bankrupt in <~<NINETEEN-EIGHTY-ONE::1981>~::{1991}>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Their concept was creating games (often based on movies) with high end audio and visual content. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "It Came From the Desert" was inspired by <NINETEEN-FIFTIES::1950s> Sci-Fi movies, like the giant ants movie, "Them!". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Much like their "The Three Stooges" game, "It Came From the Desert" feels like, sort of, bits and pieces of other games, kind of crammed together into one game - sort of a mixture of an Adventure Game and Action Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We will see a dramatically altered version of this in 'Chronturbo', at some point. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Part 2: Action Games ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Moving on, Action Games (or so-called 'Arcade Games') still make up a huge percent of Computer game releases, despite not being very good, for the most part. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Rick Dangerous ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, "Rick Dangerous" - one of the very first (if not the original) games created by Core Design, which would later go on to create "Tomb Raider". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In theory, it's a simple little Platformer, but the horrible controls give it that classic British hard game feeling. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The control scheme is actually unbelievable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Left and Right use the Z and X keys; Jump is, I believe, the O key. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 To shoot, you have to press Space while holding down some other key (possibly O) at the same time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The philosophy seems to be that you will die lots, restart lots, and make your way through this game, thanks to memorization. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Blood Money ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Psygnosis was a famous British software company, known for producing games with beautiful graphics and sound, that were utterly terrible in terms of gameplay. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Blood Money" is a very basic "Gradius"-type Shooter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was actually developed by D.M.A. Designs (who later became Rockstar North). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Totally slick presentation, but a totally bland game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Basically, it's like any generic quickie FamiCom shooter, but with ultra upgraded graphics and music. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were tons of these Euro-Sh'-'m-Ups released for the Amiga and S.T.. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Xenon 2 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Xenon <TWO::2>", created by the Bitmap Brothers is [pretty] typical and was surprisingly popular. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The general concept behind these games seems to be, 'Well, the game design is terrible; no one could ever beat this game, so we'll make it easier by adding a Life Bar.'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't think this style really holds up today, but a lot of Amiga owners went for it, back then. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Shadow of the Beast ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another hugely successful Psygnosis game was "Shadow of the Beast", developed by Reflections, who are now part of Ubisoft and made the 'Driver' series of games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean the concept art for this must've been really great. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The parallax scrolling looks hella cool, there's lots of big sprites. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But take away the purely aesthetical and technical concerns and you've got a game that could've been, like, a Tose-developed Bandai title from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SIX::1986>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Despite the game's general boringness, it's still fondly remembered today by a lot [of] people. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Batman ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 British game developers seem to knock out tons of licensed titles, as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's "Batman", based on the movie from the same year. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ocean had released a Batman Computer game in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>, as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there was one of those, sort of, like, you know, Rare-style Isometric Games a couple years before that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This would be eclipsed, of course, by Sunsoft's vastly superior game, which came out a little bit later. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸007: License to Kill ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you know, they put out tons of James Bond games in the <NINETEEN-EIGHTIES::1980s> for British computers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is in the year, you know -- the years before "GoldenEye...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, "007: License to Kill", based on the Timothy Dalton movie, which basically killed the series for, um, almost an entire decade. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There were a couple other 'Bond' Computer games that came out in <NINETEEN-NINETY::1990>, but then the whole series kind of dried up until <NINETEEN-NINETY-SEVEN::1997>. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Puffy's Saga ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from Naughty Dog and Core Design, another very young game company, Ubisoft, had released a handful [of] games in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Puffy's Saga" is sort of a cutesy version of "Gauntlet". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's barely remembered today but, quite frankly, there aren't that many pre-"Rayman" games, um, from Ubisoft that anyone does remember. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, ya know, I guess everyone had to start somewhere; and this was one of their very first games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Gravity Force ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's an odd little Amiga game, "Gravity Force", published by the German company, Kingsoft. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually a knock-off of a slightly older game, called "Thrust". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But it's importance lies when it received an unofficial sequel a few years later, called "Gravity Force <TWO::2>", which also was released in a modified form, under the name "Gravity Power". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 These versions were released for free in the Amiga Power magazine and became bizarrely popular. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At some point in the <NINETEEN-NINETY::1990>s, it was declared to be the second best video game of all time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a physics-based game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Imagine "Asteroids" with gravity thrown in.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There've been tons of games out there, just like this, but somehow this one spawned a sequel that became extremely popular... at least in Europe. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Prince of Persia ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, of course, all these games have been completely eclipsed by "Prince of Persia" - one of several <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> Computer games that are now considered to be timeless classics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the DOS version, though it was originally released for the Apple <TWO::II>. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Published by Brøderbund and designed by Jordan Mechner, "Prince..." began, sort of, a mini-craze for rotoscoped animation in games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That is, the sprite animation used filmed footage of Jordan's brother as a reference, as well as footage from classic movies like "The Adventures of Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This made the character's movement seem very smooth and lifelike and very natural. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll encounter this game again in the future, as it was ported to virtually every, uh, game system known to man. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Catacomb ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another important name in gaming history was featured in the game "Catacomb". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Catacomb" was the first game from John Carmack. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It was made for Softdisk, which was an electronic magazine, distributed on disk. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were a number of these, uh, e-magazines around, back in the <EIGHTIES::'80s> and <NINETIES::'90s>. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Catacomb" was a simple little "Gauntlet"-influenced Maze Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But two years later Carmack and his Softdisk co-worker, John Romero, made a <THREE::3>-D version of it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the rest, as they say, is history. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Looking at "Catacomb" now, it's interesting just how it -- clearly it can be seen as the basis for "Doom", "Quake", and so on, except in <TWO::2>-D and using very simple mazes. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Part 3: 3-D Games ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 In some ways, the history of Computer games in the late <EIGHTIES::'80s> and early <NINETIES::'90s> could have been seen as the transition from <TWO::2>-D to <THREE::3>-D graphics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> saw an increase in the use of polygonal <THREE::3>-D. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As computer specs improved, so did the visual quality of <THREE::3>-D games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Archepelagos ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Archepelagos" was a strange little game for the Amiga and S.T. which featured, sort of, this wonderfully smooth movement, throughout the <THREE::3>-D world. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was published by a small forgotten company called Astral Software. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was quite impressive, for the time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Computer Game World' magazine called the graphics quote-unquote "stunning - perhaps even shocking" end quote. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is deceptively simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You wander around a series of islands, destroying these little stone monoliths. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {It} doesn't really sound that great, but it still holds up somewhat today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The visuals and sound are [pretty] immersive and it's one [of] the few early <THREE::3>-D games that makes you feel like you're, sort of, really moving around in the game world. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸MechWarrior ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Dynamix (the same guys who made "Betrayal at Krondor" a few years later) developed "MechWarrior", which was published by Activision. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "MechWarrior" is based on the BattleTech tabletop War Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's basically a Giant Robot Simulation Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the use of polygons is [pretty] basic here, but it set the stage for the series, which kept going up into the XBOX era. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll see a Super Nintendo version of this at some point as well. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Austerlitz ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Primitive <THREE::3>-D was even coming to old-school-style War Games, such as "Austerlitz", the British game developed by Mirrorsoft. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 War Strategy Games are among the most stodgy of all video game genres, so it's a bit surprising to see them start to move into <THREE::3>-D. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately this game uses a stupidly opaque system of commands, so playing it today without the manual is quite impossible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I could not, in fact, even find any copies of the manual online. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Midwinter ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Developed by the Swiss game designer, Mike Singleton, and published by MicroPlay (a, uh, sub-label of MicroProse) "Midwinter" is a mash-up of an R.P.G., Strategy Game, and <THREE::3>-D Action Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you travel around in the frozen game world, (in this instance, using a snowmobile of sorts) you are treated to very nicely rendered mountains, snowdrifts, et cetera. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At the time it was really impressive just how fast everything moved. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was a s... -- [pretty] substantial hit and someone is currently in the middle of doing a remake of it. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Duel: Test Drive II ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Driving and Racing Games were one of the most common implementations of pseudo-3D effects in the <NINETEEN-EIGHTIES::1980s>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've seen plenty of these type games for the N.E.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One very popular series was Accolade's "Test Drive". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The second game in the series, "The Duel: Test Drive <TWO::II>" was a [pretty] substantial hit and ended up being ported to the Genesis, Super Nintendo, and every single Computer platform imaginable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After this, the series would drop the sprite, uh, graphics and use real <THREE::3>-D. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Vette! ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, one <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> Racing game that did use rendered <THREE::3>-D polygons was Spectrum Holobyte's "Vette!". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can choose cars, such as Porsches and Lamborghinis (just like "Test Drive <TWO::2>"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But here you get a somewhat accurate (though not very detailed) replication of San Francisco. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While "Vette!" doesn't look that [pretty], it's impressive technically. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this was the direction that Racing Games were slowly heading in. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Interphase ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another very impressive piece of work was "Interphase", developed by [a] U.K. company called The Assembly Line. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were almost <THREE::3>-D specialists, of a sort. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this was published by a company called Image Works. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a very early <THREE::3>-D Shoot-'em-Up, of sorts, with a Cyberpunk theme. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Supposedly the developer actually licensed some content from William Gibson's "Neuromancer". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While barely remembered today, "Interphase" is, in fact, a key title in the world of the early <THREE::3>-D Computer game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸David Wolf: Secret Agent ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Not so great, in any way at all, is the hilariously terrible "David Wolf: Secret Agent", also by Dynamix (the developer of "Mech Warrior"). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Wikipedia calls this an interactive movie, which is... sort of true. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game uses digitized still photos of actors, instead of live action footage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However the way the photos are shot and edited together is supposed to resemble that of a movie. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it looks kinda like an interactive movie, except the lips aren't moving as they talk. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like a lot of actual F.M.V. games, "David Wolf..." alternates between non-interactive narrative sequences and <THREE::3>-D action sequences, in which you control the player. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Usually, here, it's a scene where you drive or pilot some kind of vehicle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The wonderfully cheesy actors and the driving rhythmic music are a major part of the appeal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It just feels like a prototype for every God-awful Sega CD Full Motion Video Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And if you get killed here, you'll lose the game when the bad guys nuke the capital. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Great stuff. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Part 4: Role Playing Games ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 R.P.G.s were (and still are) a major player in the Computer game field. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> is a surprisingly uneventful year for R.P.G.s, lacking in huge, influential titles like "Wasteland", "Dungeon Master", or "Pool of Radiance". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were no sequels to "Ultima", or "Wizardry", or "Might and Magic". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But there were a few interesting, if somewhat minor games released. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Curse of the Azure Bonds ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose the most well-remembered computer R.P.G. of <EIGHTY-NINE::'89> was the second Gold Box game from S.S.I., "Curse of the Azure Bonds". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like "Pool of Radiance", it has a wonderfully evocative and nonsensical title. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It uses the same quote-unquote 'engine' as "Pool of Radiance". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Pretty] much everything is the same, with the exception of a few minor adjustments. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the larger context of the many many R.P.G.s we've seen in the 'Chrontendo' series, the S.S.I. Gold Box games reverse the normal "Dragon Quest"-style R.P.G. trend by having first-person navigation around in towns and on the overworld and then third-person battles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Still, it's an immensely well-loved game today by fans of the old-school computer R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Drakkhen ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 One of the weirdest d--- R.P.G.s of the year is "Drakkhen" from Infogrames - mostly known for being one of the very first R.P.G.s for the Super Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Drakkhen is different than just about every other R.P.G. at the time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We don't see tons of French R.P.G.s, but this one breaks all the rules. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It has this third-person <THREE::3>-D viewpoint, the battles are automatic (you don't actually control the players individually). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Various annoying things happen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, if there are lakes and you get too close, your party will actually simply <~drowned~::{drown}> in the lakes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game has [this] slightly eerie atmosphere, with bizarre enemies popping up out of nowhere. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Really, it's quite weird. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Prophecy I: The Fall of Trinadon ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also a little unusual - "Prophecy <ONE::I>: <~Fall of the~::{The Fall of}> Trinadon" which looks sort of like a "...Zelda"-influenced J.R.P.G., yet it was developed and published by Activision. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a rather fast-paced Action R.P.G. where you can move around very quickly and just, you know, start waling on enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Activision clearly intended [to] b... -- this to be the first in a series, which never happened. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Activision was not normally associated with R.P.G.s at this time, which makes this a bit of an oddity in their catalog. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Dragon Wars ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 A bit more traditional is Interplay's "Dragon Wars". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While not remembered as well as "Bard's Tale" or "Wasteland", this is a reasonably slick R.P.G., done entirely in the first person view. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, this was originally created to be "Bard's Tale <FOUR::4>". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Interplay split with Electronic Arts, who owned the rights to the name "Bard's Tale". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was the first game published by Interplay themselves, I believe, who would obviously go on to be [pretty] successful. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, I suppose we can consider this to be, sort of, you know, the "lost" 'Bard's Tale' game - sort of, the unofficial "Bard's Tale <FOUR::4>". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Part 5: Strategy and Simulation Games ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Various sorts of Simulation Games existed in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Older genres like hex-based War Games, Sports Games, Flight Sims, Tank Sims, also Strategy Games continued to evolve. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 With improvements in graphical capabilities, the genre slowly moved from abstract maps and charts to visually appealing Point-and-Click Games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Tons of Sports Games hit the shelves in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, with Electronic Arts being the big dog by licensing various names and franchises. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But even guys like Data East were getting into the business. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸A.B.C. Monday Night Football ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 "A.B.C. Monday Night Football" was based on "Monday Night Football" - a weekly N.F.L. broadcast on A.B.C.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Featuring such broadcasting personalities, uh, like Frank Gifford, it's a good example of just how slick Sports Games were becoming, at this time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Hello, everyone! I'm Frank Gifford, along with Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's go down to the field for the s... " 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It was produced by Park Place Productions, who were, for a while, one of the biggest Sports Game developers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Down! Set! Hut!" 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Ugh! Ugh! Ughhh!" 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Referee's whistle blowing] 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Grand Monster Slam ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Over in Europe, "Grand Monster Slam" is a rather odd update on "Penguin Wars", which you might recall we covered in 'Chrontendo', as it was released on the FamiCom in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-FIVE::1985>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is simply to knock those things into your opponent's territories. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 {It's} not a fantastic game, by any stretch, but it is an example of the sort of emergent fantasy or Sci-Fi themed Sports Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll see more of this kind of stuff start to appear in the early <NINETIES::'90s>. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Millenium 2.2 // Millenium: Return to Earth ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Space-Exploration Strategy Games were, sort of, a mini-genre, at this time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While we're still a few years away from the classic <Four-X::4X> genre, games like, uh, Ian Bird's "Millennium <TWO-POINT-TWO::2.2>" (or "Millennium: Return to Earth, as the DOS version was called) provided a slick, visually appealing Strategy Game, focused on resource management. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You collect minerals, gas, et cetera, build equipment, research new technologies, colonize other planets, and set up defenses from alien invaders. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Warlords ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Old-school computer War Strategy Games often were very detailed, technical, and focused on historical accuracy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But eventually more accessible games with fantastical elements became immensely popular. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 S.S.G's "Warlords" is, sort of, like, uh, a proto-"Warcraft"-type game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Up to eight players take turns exploring, battling, conquering castles, producing units, and so on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'Warlord' series became reasonably successful, spawning four sequels and eventually birthing a more successful spin-off, "Puzzle Quest". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, "Puzzle Quest", um, officially takes place in the "Warlords" universe. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Populous ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd say the most well-remembered Strategy Game from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> is Bullfrog's "Populous". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is not the first game from Bullfrog and it wasn't the first game designed by Peter Molyneux, but it is their really first successful game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's inevitably referred to as creating the so-called God-Game genre. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, really, I don't know that the God-Game is well-defined enough to be worthy of its own genre. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It mostly just seems to refer to the "Populous" series and a few other games designed by Peter Molyneux. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You do, in fact, play as a god. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... You go around raising and lowering land, so that people can make buildings [and increase] their population. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This increases your, uh, magic (or "mana", as they call it) which allows you to do things like, uh, strike down enemy forces with earthquakes and volcanoes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like a lot of later Strategy Games, it's insanely addictive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It would spawn two sequels and get ported to almost every possible game platform, so we'll be seeing again, at some point in the future. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸North and South ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 "North and South" is an attempt to, uh, create a simplified Actiony War Game, from the French developer, Infogrames. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's based on the U.S. Civil War. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It was [pretty] successful, though not necessarily liked by traditional War Games fans. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Computer Gaming World' gave it one star out of five. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However it did get a N.E.S. port in <NINETEEN-NINETY::1990>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I suspect that most of you out there who are familiar with "North and South" know it from the N.E.S. version. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Harpoon ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Way, way on the other end of the spectrum is "Harpoon", an ultra-realistic and very complicated Naval Warfare Game (the first in what is generally considered to be the finest Naval Simulation Game series). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Created by Three-Sixty Pacific, this was based on the Board Game, which was made by, uh, the Tom Clancy collaborator and real life naval officer, Larry Bond. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Harpoon" actually came with a booklet, written by Clancy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And in 'Computer Gaming World' the reviewer stated he learned more about naval warfare playing this game than he did during his year at the Naval War College. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Three-Sixty Pacific put out a number of other highly regarded Computer War Games, but eventually collapsed in the mid-'90s. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Nuclear War ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 On a much lighter note, New World's Computing "<~Nuculer~::[Nuclear]> War" is a satirical War Game, based on the concept of <~nuculer~::[nuclear]> war between five nations, released at a time when the possibility of an actual <~nuculer~::[nuclear]> war was becoming much less likely. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The subject seems a little dated and its caricatures of world leaders like Reagan, Thatcher, and Chairman Mao would have seemed [pretty] edgy in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-TWO::1982>... but not so much in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Still, it's cool to be able to nuke stuff and, technically, the game can even end with no one winning. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, at the very least, it's an interesting idea. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Sim City ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Finally, we'll end with what is probably the biggest game of <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, in some senses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Sim City" was created by Will Wright, after he, uh, realized that the level designer on his earlier game, "Raid on Bungeling Bay", was a lot of fun to fool around with. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In theory, "Sim City" is not a game that you can win or lose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's simply sort of a toy, which allows you to create cities by laying down roads, zoning areas, creating public services, and so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You come up with budgets for the city, apply taxes, check the poll to see how popular you are with the citizens, {et cetera}. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Depending on your choices, your city may thrive or fail. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Other elements can be added in, like natural disasters or giant monsters, which can damage the city. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And at Brøderbund's request, Maxis added in some challenge modes to make the game seem more game-like. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The success of "Sim City" spawned several sequels and spin-offs, including the massively popular 'Sims' games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Conclusion: Back to Chrontendo ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this concludes our <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> Computer Games Round-Up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll go ahead and, sort of, pick up where we left off with 'Chrontendo' - right smack in the middle of October, <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Twin Eagle 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1991 April 12 🇯🇵 // 1989 October [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Seta | Visco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Visco 🇯🇵 // Romstar 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, time for some U.S.-[only] releases for October. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here's an odd one: "Twin Eagle: Revenge Joe's Brother". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is theoretically a port of a <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> Arcade game from Seta. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can probably guess, by the name, this was a military-themed shooter, of a kind so popular in arcades, in the mid to late <EIGHTIES::'80s>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, boy, is this a stinker! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Some sources say it was co-developed by Visco, who had connections with Seta. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not really clear who did this particular port. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But it's not at all faithful to the Arcade game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, your helicopter is very slow, in comparison to enemy projectiles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies typically come straight at you, from above or behind, while firing at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Since you can [only] fire directly forward, you need to get right up behind enemies, in order to shoot them, which often ends with them firing a bullet right at you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So far, this seems [pretty] standard for these kind of games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But either the hit detection is very weird or enemies take multiple hits to be destroyed, because you will frequently see your bullets, like, pass right through enemies without harming them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In most games, you would see, like, the bullet disappear or the enemy flash or something when you hit them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, here, no; the bullets just pass right through. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This problem is alleviated once you get better weapons, but when you have the peashooter, "Twin Eagle" just sucks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The weapons upgrades are all [pretty] boring and lame anyway. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So don't expect this to get much better, once you do pick up some power-ups. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Instead of boss battles, there are just sections where you start traveling really fast and enemy planes go whizzing by. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These parts are actually even worse than the regular parts. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of these issues are port-specific. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While the Arcade game is barely remembered today, it doesn't really have any of these problems. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your 'copter controls smoothly, um, shooting enemies isn't that much of a problem, the music is not horrible, and grating, and awful. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The weapons system works differently, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to pick up a steady supply of missiles, otherwise, you'll be stuck using your regular gun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even the speedy sections are not that bad. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Home game begins with an over water section. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The third level more resembles the Arcade game's first level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, you deal with tanks, enemy soldiers, and lots of destructible buildings. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's still [pretty] d--- irritating, though. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So this was published by Romstar in the U.S. and did come out in Japan in <NINETEEN-NINETY-ONE::1991>, for some reason. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While "Twin Eagle" is not the absolute worst Shoot-'em-Up we've seen so far, it's definitely near the bottom [of] the list. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jeopardy! Junior Edition 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 October [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by GameTek 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Wow! So we've got a couple more games, here, from Rare. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's astonishing how many games they pumped out during this time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are literally Rare games coming out every month, at this point. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Today's two are both Game Show Games, published by GameTek, who specialized in Game Show Video Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Almost exactly a year prior to this, GameTek put out games based on "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And now they return to that particular well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First up, is "Jeopardy: Junior Edition". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, it's "Jeopardy!" but aimed at a younger audience. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You pick the number of players, difficulty level, and then select a player - some of which are quite weird-looking. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Holy crap! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What is with her eyes!? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {Is} she tripping? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you select what you wanna look like, the game itself begins. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like real "Jeopardy!", you pick a clue off the board, hit the buzzer if you wanna answer the question, and then phrase the answer in the form of a question. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'phrasing in the form of a question' part is already covered, as "What is?" is already typed out for you and you just need to fill in the rest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, clearly Rare saved themselves a lot of time and effort by simply re-using [pretty] much everything from their first "Jeopardy!" game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's literally the same game, with a, uh, slightly altered title screen and different questions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, that and they did create new graphics for the characters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But regardless, absolutely minimal changes were made to the old game in order to create this one. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The whole idea of Junior Jeopardy is that, you know, these are for kids and the questions are a bit easier (and based on, sort of, like, common knowledge type questions). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some might be tricky for kids like, uh, "Do you know what city the Grand <~Old~::{Ole}> Opry is in?". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (I mean, maybe you do now, but did you know that when you were a, like -- a little kid?) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's one I got wrong: Under 'School Days': Advancement to the Next Grade. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, uh, graduation, I guess? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Can you graduate from third grade? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd normally say that, you know, you've "passed" third grade. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I tried "graduation" and... nope! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 {It} turns out the answer is... "promotion"!? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In all my years of going to school, I don't ever recall hearing that word used... in that sense. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Is -- Is this a British usage? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Is it, like, an east coast thing? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I -- I really don't know. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As before, typing in your answers is slow and awkward. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Jeopardy!" is way more suited to being -- being played on a computer with a keyboard than on a console with a controller. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Mis-spelling a word can be an issue. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I once got an answer wrong because I spelled "nightingale" with an "e" where the second "i" should have been. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, bad spellers will have a serious handicap. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Final Jeopardy works on the honor system, since the other players can see your answer if you go first. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game ends by declaring the winner and then instantly going back to the title screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It doesn't even let you bask in your moment of glory for even a second. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Jeopardy! Junior Edition" is not exactly a terrible game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But there's really no point to play this, nowadays. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Wheel of Fortune: Junior Edition 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 October [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by GameTek 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And of course GameTek followed up "Jeopardy! Junior Edition" with "Wheel of Fortune: Junior Edition". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even moreso than the "Jeopardy!..." game, this is indistinguishable from the earlier "Wheel of Fortune" game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, the phrases are easier, I suppose, but everything else is exactly the same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 With "Jeopardy!..." they added new graphics for the players, but here there actually are no player graphics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So this looks exactly like the earlier game (aside from the fact that the word "Junior" was added on to the old title screen). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Even if you don't remember the first game, it's [pretty] obvious how this works. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You spin the wheel, choose a letter... 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike "Jeopardy!...", any player can get [pretty] much locked out of the game, since the same player keeps spinning until they pick a wrong letter. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While the interface is better than "Jeopardy!...", the graphics and color scheme is just hideous as all hell. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The bonus round lets you choose a prize, for some reason. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {That's} not the official, uh, Disney World logo there, I suspect, and the use of "Disney World" is probably not authorized. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As with the "Jeopardy! Junior Edition", the game ends by telling the winner they won and then quickly taking you right back to the title screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While technically not a terrible game, it's hard to imagine anyone needing to play this today over the first N.E.S. "Wheel of Fortune" game, unless you are a young child or just a <~duffered~::[duffer]>. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Three Stooges 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 October [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Cinemaware | Beam Software
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Activision 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Hey, fellas! We're in the wrong game!" 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey, this looks like a kid's game! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "You imbeciles!" 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Sound of a slapped face] 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Hey!" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, Lord! Time for some seriously mind-numbing crap: one of two terrible games, published by Activision this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First up, we have "Three Stooges". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is from Beam Software. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Wow! So we've had Beam games in three episodes in a row. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And at least, unlike "Back to the Future", Beam did not develop this from scratch; it's a port of a game from Cinemaware. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We saw the original "...Three Stooges" game in the <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987> Computer Game Round-Up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was an early game from Cinemaware: a company formed to produce... Cinematic Games (I suppose?) for the relatively new Commodore Amiga. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Their first (and most successful game, I believe) was "Defender of the Crown". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The N.E.S. version of that (published by Konami's Ultra Games) came out in July <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The main appeal of the "...Three Stooges" game was the... sort of, the high quality graphics and the voice samples. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game, itself, was simply a collection of uninteresting mini-games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "We gotta figure out a way to get some money and get it quick!" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, obviously, graphically speaking, this takes a [pretty] huge hit on the N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually [pretty] ugly! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Still, a lot of, uh, semi-decent voice samples did make it into the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I'll admit, I do not like the whole, uh, "Let's throw together some lame mini-games." genre. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I also don't like unintuitive gameplay and awkward or overly complex control schemes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, brother, let me tell you that "...Three Stooges" has all of that in spades. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, for example, is the cracker-eating game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You move your spoon around and press the button to scoop up a cracker. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, obviously eating crackers out of soup is not hard, but they made it much more difficult by making your spoon hard to control. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It slides all around when you try to move it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The crackers also disappear quite quickly, and the game frequently cuts to a rather annoying shot of Curly looking at the soup and making that "Aagh!" noise. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The whole thing seems bizarre and random, out of context (the context of which is actually a scene from the <NINETEEN-FORTY-ONE::1941> short, "Dutiful But Dumb", in which Curly gets a bowl of soup with a live oyster that keep snatching up the crackers). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the player encountering the game for the first time is likely to be baffled as {to} just what the hell is going on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And even I don't quite understand the random cutaways to Curly, um, making that weird, uh, obnoxious noise that he makes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object of the game is to raise money in a limited time period. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each day, you get a different job of some sort to to do, which you pick using this moving hand, uh, sort of spinning wheel contraption, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Trivia, for example, takes you to, uh, Zielinski Radios, and you play a radio trivia game, based on "...Three Stooges". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Trivia questions are asked and you get money for each right answer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though really [only] hardcore "...Three Stooges" fans would actually know any of these. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Other games are Boxing (which is actually like the walking section of "Back to the Future", [only] worse). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You know, looking at "...Three Stooges", I wonder if Beam lifted some ideas from this game for use in "Back to the Future". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You don't do any boxing, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Instead, Larry walks down the street and you move him up and down to avoid obstacles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All the obstacles are cluttered, near the bottom of the screen, so the trick is determining if you're going to collide with something or not. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's obnoxious as hell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I never figured out how to avoid tripping on that... thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (What is it? A dead body?) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it turns out you can jump, but this is absolutely not mentioned in the manual. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It gives you the control scheme for this mini-game, but does not mention jumping whatsoever, so I wrongfully assumed that you couldn't. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The easiest game is probably the hospital one, where you simply need to speed down the hall, avoiding other people. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not in the least exciting, but at least you can make good money. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yes, and, once again (just like "Back to the Future") it's easy to kind of cheat (or, at least, you know, avoid collisions) by hitting the Pause button. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The other games are a pie-throwing contest (with a really hateful control scheme) and a slapping game, which doesn't get you any money, but makes the hand that selects the game move either faster or slower, depending on how you do. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You want to slap or kick Larry and Curly as many times as possible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, I kid you not, here is the controls instructions from the manual. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This looks absurdly complicated but it doesn't really matter, because, in reality, you can just alternate punching back and forth between the two to rack up enough points to get the -- the lower speed, down on the hand selector. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And that's actually all the mini-games there are. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are a few other events on the job selector that aren't games (most notably the mousetrap, which breaks your finger. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Break all your fingers and the game's over). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The safe is simply a scene where you walk up to a door and receive a check, purportedly because a safe fell on Curly's head. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This part (you know, with the safe actually falling on him) is not shown in-game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If the hand lands on the dollar sign, you'll get a little cutscene where the Three Stooges walk into <~a~::{an}> alley and find a, uh, bag of money just lying on the ground. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, when they open it up it's actually not cash, but mysteriously a check, made payable to The Three Stooges. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And that's more or less about it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... The hard part is actually avoiding the mouse traps. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you can make it to Day <Thirty::30>, you'll probably have enough money to avoid the bad ending, in which the orphanages get closed down. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I, myself, later got the second-best ending, in which the orphanage is saved and they make the roof repairs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This requires at least $10,000. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The best ending has you marrying three daughters of the lady who runs the orphanage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like in "Back to the Future", the endings are super short and it -- it immediately goes back to the title screen - no "Congratulations", no credits, or anything. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, while this is not as well-known as "Back to the Future", I think I actually like "...Three Stooges" *less* (which is really [pretty] amazing, when you think about it). 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Stealth ATF 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 October [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Imagineering
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Activision 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our second (rather terrible) game from Activision today is "Stealth A.T.F." developed by Imagineering of Glen Rock, New Jersey. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A.T.F. stands for "Advanced Tactical Fighter", though exactly what type of aircraft you are operating in this game is up for debate. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the title screen, here, we see the Lockheed F-<ONE-SEVENTEEN-A::117A> Nighthawk - the so-called Stealth Fighter, which is a different aircraft than the Advanced Tactical Fighter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the Stealth Fighter is used to attack ground targets, not other aircraft. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The fighter on the box art looks nothing at all like the Nighthawk and the one we see in-game looks... sort of like the Nighthawk. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Regardless, the Nighthawk was a completely hot property at this time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was a top-secret project, whose development first became known during the Carter administration and which was the subject of much speculation throughout the <EIGHTIES::'80s>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Air Force, after various rumors and leaks, officially unveiled it to the public in November <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Regardless of all that, Stealth Fighter A.T.F. is basically just another <EIGHT::8>-bit Military Flight Simulation Game, very much like "Top Gun". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's maybe even worse than "Top Gun". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is divided up into eight missions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In each one, you need to take down a series of enemies (or "bogeys", as the game calls them). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Perhaps I'm mistaken, but since we are going after confirmed enemy aircraft, shouldn't they be called "bandits" instead of "bogeys"? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You have some kind of machine gun weapon (or "cannon" as the game's manual calls it) and a few guided missiles, which sometimes successfully home in on enemies and other times just fly off in the opposite direction. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies generally come at you head on, then fly past you, and eventually come at you head-on again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can do a roll and chase them, I suppose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your radar screen assists you in tracking them (though, by the way, the actual Stealth Fighter did not have radar, as far as I know). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've managed to hunt down a significant number of "bogeys", you will then be required to land your plane. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Remember how, in "Top Gun", you always crashed your plane when you tried to land it? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, guess what. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the manual gives you no idea how to land, other than, uh, quote-unquote "You must learn the correct speed {and} angle of attack to make a safe landing." 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well that's just fine and ducky; let's just sort of experiment randomly until we just happen to get the landing right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By the way, crashing when attempting to land means you have to replay the level from the beginning. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Great stuff. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, am I gonna tell you how to land? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nope! Figure it out, yourself. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 All the levels are more or less the same; just the ground pattern changes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies get more aggressive as you make progress, but there's really no ending. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After, uh, the eighth level, the game just basically repeats in a loop, over and over. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The developer, Imagineering, was actually part of Absolute (the company founded by Garry Kitchen and David Crane, when they left Activision). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the, uh, first Imagineering game for the N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They would go on to do, ah, various games involving licensed properties (including, coincidentally, "Ghostbusters <TWO::2>"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from "A Boy and His Blob", their most famous game, now, is probably one that never came out: "Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors", which included "Desert Bus". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Despite being called "Stealth Fighter", this game really has nothing to do with the real life plane. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a standard Air Combat Game which they decided to tack on the name, "Stealth Fighter" to, because [of] the huge amount of interest in -- about the Nighthawk, at that time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [only] thing connected to the actual plane is a "Stealth Mode". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... You can (once a level) hit the Start button to go into Stealth Mode, during which enemy fighters can't see you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Really, though, Stealth Fighter A.T.F. is [pretty] terrible and I'd avoid it at all costs. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gozonji Yaji Kita Chindochuu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November 07 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hyperware
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL Laboratory 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Darn! That's some annoying music! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 November <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, at last. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here is a total obscurity: "Gozonji Yaji Kita Chindochuu" (one of those rare FamiCom games that doesn't even have its own page on Japanese Wikipedia). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The title translates to something like, "As You Know, Yaji and Kita's Incident-Filled Adventure". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is published by HAL Laboratory and developed by someone called Hyperware. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the second Hyperware-developed game we've seen (the first being "Satsui no Kaiso...", a Murder Mystery Adventure Game, uh, which we covered way back in "Chrontendo ... <TWENTY-SEVEN::27>"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was also published by HAL and is a game which... I can actually remember... absolutely nothing about. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Gozonji..." is yet another Menu-Based Adventure Game (one which takes place in historical Japan, I think) but also includes modern elements. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It also veers into rather stranger territory. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd say this looks like a relatively slick game, however in terms of mechanics it -- it seems [pretty] standard. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have the normal old "Portopia"-style commands (Look, Talk, Ask, and a few other commands that appear in special situations). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It does, however, make use of a highly unusual concept: the invisible menu selection. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Finding it is required to get out of this particular situation. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 That said, "Gozonji..." is very heavy on the dialogue. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Japanese Adventure Games made a long slow transition to the Visual Novel and increased dialogue exchanges is part of that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We saw a bit of this, last episode, with Nintendo's FamiCom "Mukashibanashi" game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The gameplay aspect of "Gozonji..." is really not that interesting. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Its appeal lies more in the storytelling and its wacky sense of humor. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game gets quite weird, as it progresses, throwing in castles, race car drivers, demons, and (I think) Chinese-hopping vampires(?). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So this really isn't a game that a non-Japanese speaker can appreciate. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But it is a fascinating-looking game, um, and unfortunately one that's unlikely to ever get an English translation. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dungeon & Magic: Swords of Element 🇯🇵 // Dungeon Magic: Sword of the Elements 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November 10 🇯🇵 // 1990 July [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?]
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Natsume 🇯🇵 // Taito 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah, yes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's another game developed and published by Natsume (the second Natsume-published game, I think) "Dungeon Master: Sword of Element". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Natsume is not really known for its R.P.G.s but this, here, is an attempt to, uh, make, sort of, like, a western-style R.P.G. for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This got a U.S. release mid-1990 by Taito, with the grammatically more correct title, "Dungeon Magic: Sword of Elements". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The plot is typical; some vague ancient evil force has returned and you are tasked with defeating it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sorry, kid, we can't spare you any money or weapons or anything. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The world's gonna be plunged into darkness if you don't succeed, but you're on your own. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So we've seen tons of "Dragon Quest"-style clones and a decent number of "Wizardry"-type dungeon crawlers, but "Dungeon Magic" takes inspiration from a slightly more recent source: the "Bard's Tale" games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most notably, it uses, like, that first person viewpoint as you walk around in towns and on the overworld. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was becoming increasingly popular in western computer R.P.G.s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The S.S.I. Gold Box games also used a very similar system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is not the first Japanese R.P.G. we've seen to use the first-person perspective on the overworld, but it seems like the first I can think of that is, like, blatantly trying to look like a "Bard's Tale" game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The thing is, this doesn't translate that well to the N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Walking around in towns - you [pretty] much mostly see just, like, a generic wall on either side of you or just an empty blue background. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All the shops and whatnot are just gener... -- generic doors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It can be really irritating just to walk into a town and try to figure out where the inn is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thankfully, you have a compass that at least shows you what direction you're facing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first thing to do, outside of the city walls, is enter this castle and talk to the king. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Strangely, the castle is a mostly-empty dungeon-like maze. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I saw these stairs going up and thought, "Hey! This must... -- Maybe this takes me to the second floor.", but I somehow ended up outside and was instantly beset upon by snakes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The king and queen are somewhat well-hidden, right in the middle of the castle, but at least this dude gives you a hundred gold and s----- sword. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's really hard for me to like "Dungeon Magic". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's so drab and visually unappealing - full of ugly reddish browns. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The random battles that occur on the overworld are [pretty] chaotic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies just, sort of, wander around at all times and just, sort of, appear in front of you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... They can even attack you as you're passing by and take off some Hit Points as you're walking by them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the interface is, uh, [pretty] clunky as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to choose a magic school to join. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... I did this completely unwittingly by wandering into a building and talking to some guy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You Level Up by going back and talking to one of the guys for whatever school of magic you belong to. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, actually, N.P.C.s getting in your way in this game are even more obnoxious than in most Top-Down R.P.G.s. since, to go around them you need to, like, rotate <NINETY-DEGREES::90°>, take a step forward, and basically repeat this three times to get around 'em. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Despite the general obnoxiousness of "Dungeon Magic", I learned a lot [of] people really liked this, back in the day - or at least played it for hours on end. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Perhaps this is due to not having access to any high-end computer R.P.G.s and "Dungeon Magic" being [pretty] much the closest thing there is on the N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd never heard of it until now, so I was [pretty] surprised to learn that it has some kind of fanbase. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's apparently reasonably deep and involved and, uh, maybe it's secretly a good game, but I hated, uh, every g-d--- minute I spent playing it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, I guess "to each, his own". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 US Championship V'Ball 🇯🇵 // Super Spike V'Ball 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 November 10 🇯🇵 // 1990 February [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Technos
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Technos 🇯🇵 // Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One last game this episode: from Technos Japan, "U.S. Championship V'Ball". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, technically, there was another game that came out a few days after this: the second disk of Nintendo's Yuyuki for the F.D.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But we already covered that last episode, along with the first disk. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, yeah, this is a V'Ball Game from Technos. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's what we called it back then, 'V'Ball'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {We had} no time to waste, calling it 'volleyball; I mean the <EIGHTIES::'80s> were frantic! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The time wasted uttering those extra two syllables... you know, you could do another bump of coke! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You know what I mean? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are various gameplay options, uh, for up to four players. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can choose among several teams, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, uh, including, uh, George and Michael (Hmm!) and, of course Billy and Jimmy from "Double Dragon". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, there appear to be two massive monster trucks parked behind the stand, for some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Naturally, Nintendo themselves released this in the U.S. in early <NINETEEN-NINETY::1990>, under the even more radical name, "Super Spike V'Ball". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a National Circuit and a World Cup Circuit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The opponents in the World Cup Circuit seem to be a bit more difficult, as far as I can tell. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I have nothing against this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It feels well designed, I suppose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For some reason, I just didn't like it nearly as much as, uh, Technos' "Super Dodge Ball". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It works [pretty] similar to [the] earlier game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have multiple offensive and defensive moves, including the titular Super Spike, which (I'll confess) I never actually managed to pull off. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Those of you who played this as a -- as a young person might have a great deal [of] love and nostalgic attachment for this game, but it really just didn't appeal to me that much. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 50 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, that wraps it up! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not sure what I'd pick for the Best Game this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe... nothing? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were a few decent items, but nothing that really stands out to me. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As for Worst Game, perhaps "...Three Stooges"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Something about this style of game just irritates the hell out of me! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this one is just so crudely made and pointless. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, guess what happens next time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, we finally reached December <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm excited too! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We've got at least, uh, one well-known game from Taito, a couple almost completely forgotten U.S.-[only] games from Nintendo, and -- and one of Square's very last games before they, sort of, went to virtually <a hundred percent::100%> Fantasy-themed R.P.G.s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh! Also the U.S. release of a game that we've already seen in some form or another about three times in this series. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, I hope to see ya then. 🍇🍌
