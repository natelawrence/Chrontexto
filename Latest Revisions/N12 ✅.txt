👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 12 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hello, and welcome to "Chrontendo Episode *12*"! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Today, we're looking at another 15 games [released for] the FamiCom - in this case, [between] November and December of 1986. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [at] *this* point in time, we are *really*, sort of, entering the holiday *season* in Japan, and you're gonna see a *dramatic* increase in the number of games released for the *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This, of course, was true last year as *well*, but whereas *1985* saw, I believe, [only] around 27 games [released in the months] of [November and December], 1986 [will] see around 47. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Furthermore*, we're gonna see a *lot of games* that [are released] by companies whose *primary* business is *not* making video games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, in *this* episode, I *think* around *half* the games are released by companies [that are] *normally* record companies, animation companies, {and} those sorts of things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Because of the incredible *popularity* of the FamiCom in Japan, at this *point*, really *everyone* was tryin' [to get into] the [video] game market. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Unfortunately*, this means that some terrible, terrible *games* [are] being *released*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *But*, on the other hand, we have some [pretty] good games this episode as well. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Aigina no Yogen: From the Legend of Babubalouk 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 21 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by VIC TOKAI
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by VIC TOKAI 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I must say [that] this is some [of] the most [grating] music I've heard on the FamiCom so far. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, I guess this intro is reasonably cool. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is "Aighina no Yogen...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (At least I hope that's how it's pronounced; probably it's not pronounced 'Agina'.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, upon seeing this, you might think, 'Well, this looks kinda like "Ninja Kid".' 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the actual, uh, game idea is [pretty] similar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'd enter each little portal on the overworld, then go through [several] -- several levels, and then, uh, go back [to] the overworld and do the next portal. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, in each dungeon, you should be looking for a piece of this star-shaped object. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [believe] there's one piece hidden [in] each dungeon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is quite similar, of course, [to] the plot of "...Legend of Zelda". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, the actual gameplay is quite different than either of these games; you actually have no direct offensive capabilities. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Rather you use [these] little spigot things [to shoot] monsters on either side of you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 After you've shot a certain number, a little [exit will] appear, and ya can go on [to] the next level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah, you see the little exit ladder, right there! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, you will find various hidden items such as keys which [can] be used to unlock treasure chests. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] other words, this is, uh, [your] basic, uh, Action Adventure / uh, R.P.G. elements (kind of with a rather bizarre gameplay idea added in). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Also notable: this is the first game from VIC TOKAI for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, this is probably one [of] the first games that VIC TOKAI developed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 'TOKAI' is actually an established Japanese utility company, and VIC TOKAI is their telecommunications branch. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The 'VIC' is, uh -- stands for Valuable Information and Communication. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In 1986, they started developing, uh, and publishing video games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And they're also known in the U.S., uh, for having released some video games [that] they've not actually originally published themselves. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, "Bump 'n' Jump" was originally on Data East; in the U.S., it was published by VIC TOKAI. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They started publishing [and] developing video games in 1986 and got out of the, uh, video game business in a r... hmm -- sometime in the late '90s. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's where I use one [of] the power-ups; this will swirl around [and] kill any monsters. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Any] power-ups ya have will be in -- or any objects ya have will be listed up at the, uh, top [of] the screen, there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You also, uh, collect money [and can] buy things [in {the} little] shops [that] ya find, occasionally. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There's the entrance up near the top [of] the screen, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's [actually] a little wizard dude who lives up there [and] he'll give you helpful advice (well, not really helpful). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, up until this point, the game was playable, if certainly not exceptional. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, once I got [to] the first boss, the whole game sort of, uh, falls apart. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 What ya need [to] do here is to jump over him, grab the first piece of little star doohickey, and then escape by jumping back on the block [and] getting up to the exit. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, uh, it's actually quite difficult. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can't] kill him; you have no weapons on you, really. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You need [to] simply jump over him and jump back on the block. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And because the jumping controls in this game [are] so weird, I simply could not [get] back on [that] block. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's also virtually impossible [to] jump over him. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... I tried this numerous times, kept getting killed, and eventually gave up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I really, uh, can't recommend this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 At this point it [pretty] much ceases [to] be any fun [at] all. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ganso Saiyūki: Super Monkey Daibōken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "(ximeR naciR otreuP) snaC niT" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 21 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?]
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by VAP 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our second game this episode is the [utterly] infamous "Ganso Saiyūki: Super Monkey Daibōken" - a premium example of what they call 'kusoge' in the east (that is literally 'a shitty game'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 First off, despite being a cartridge, "...Super Monkey..." seems [to] have loading times [for] some mysterious reason. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Saiyuki" is what the Japanese call the Chinese novel, "Journey to the West". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Which, as you recall, was also the inspiration [for] the game, "SonSon", as well as countless Japanese comics, TV shows, [and] cartoons.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Right away, you'll notice the graphics look almost like those from an earlier generation of [video] game consoles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They have a, [sort] of, Atari 2600 feel [to] them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll probably [also] notice [that] you just seem [to be, sort] of, wandering [around this little island] with nothing [to] do. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You [can] explore the [island] but there -- nothing [actually] ever really seems to occur on it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is probably the first frustration gamers [will] encounter when they pick [up] this game is, uh, 'Hey, I'm just, sort of, wandering around; there's nothing going on here - no enemies, really nothing at all.'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, eventually, [you] might figure out [that] you'll need to actually enter the little [mountain] range (the suspiciously green [mountain] range, there). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And once you, uh, actually enter that and, sort of, walk into the mountains, you will find yourself transported mysteriously, uh, someplace else. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Where exactly [you] are now, I'm not sure, but it is sort of an -- an open, uh, field, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You're, sort of, on the, uh, overworld section of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, after more wandering around, you'll find a little house (quite small [and] not very noticeable there). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You enter it and then... [you] see a person, [you] see some stuff, and... suddenly you are back [out] on the overworld. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [What] actually happened is you picked up some food [and] water necessary for survival. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you don't come across these [little] houses, [eventually] your characters [will] die of thirst [or] starvation. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 At this point, you then continue to wander aimlessly [around] the huge overworld, and this game really is huge. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [There's sort] of miles [and] miles of nothing [in] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I guess ya should just, [sort] of, try [to] head in a general westenrly direction. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, many gamers' reactions (even [in] Japan) is, 'Well, what [exactly] am [I supposed to] be doing here?' and 'Not much seems [to] be happening.'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [However] there are random enemy encounters where the action switches to a side view. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, these action scenes [are] so badly done; they're a little bit difficult to [interpret]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But it] seems [that] you mostly, sort of, jump around up [in] the air [and hit] enemies [with your] stick. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though of course, uh, ya know, there's nothing even [remotely] resembling good gameplay here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 By the way, [that] little dragon guy seems [to] be on your team. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well], after a little while, this scene [will] end almost as suddenly as it began [and], you'll be back on the overworld. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah. Finally done. Okay! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There ends, and there's a loading screen, and you are back [to] more exciting walking action. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Along the way, you'll pick up some [of your] friends, and there is a -- supposedly even some sort of *boss* [in] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But "...Super Monkey Daibōken" seems [to consist] of [around] 90% walking across the overworld at excruciatingly slow speed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Almost [as] if the makers [of] this game wanted to depict a passage across China in real-time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, who is responsible for the -- this? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, this is the first FamiCom release from VAP (Video and Audio Project - a Japanese music and television company). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As [for the] developers, they have wisely chosen [to] remain anonymous. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, "...Super Monkey Daibōken" does have a cult following in Japan, and it's considered [to] be one of the absolute worst games ever made. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Admittedly, of all the games I've played [for] the FamiCom so far, this seems the least like a real game, the way it alternates between absurdly long, boring walking sequences and then these brief incomprehensible battle sequences. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game [seems to be] developed by individuals who really have no idea of what a video game is. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, there definitely are some bad games [for] the FamiCom and the N.E.S., but I don't know that r... -- really anything I've seen so far quite compares to "...Super Monkey Daibōken". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unless I [come] across something else really bad, uh, this [is] probably [gonna] get the title of worst FamiCom game ever. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nagagutsu o Haita Neko: Sekai Isshū 80 Nichi Dai Bōken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 21 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Shoei System
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toei 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Hooray! It's another game from Toei and Shouei System - the same team [that] brought us that pile of shit, "Hokuto no Ken". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Nagagutsu o Haita Neko..." features Pero, Toei's mascot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Pero was taken from Toei's 1969 film [of] the same name, based on the well-known fairytale, "Puss 'n Boots". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] film is notable [for] the [involvement of] the young Hayao Miyazaki, [who's probably] the most well-known figure in Japanese animation today, due [to] the international attention [that his] films, such as "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Spirited Away", have received. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, the game we [are] looking at now is actually based on Toei's [1976] sequel (known in the West as "Puss 'n Boots Travels Around the World"). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Toei's game is a [pretty] standard 'run, [duck], jump, [and] shoot' [kind] of Platformer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 At the end of each level, you'll face, well, the exact same boss over [and] over again - Green Dragon [that] shoots fireballs [at] you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Whoops, there's the old -- 'I got hit with a fireball, [just as] I was [finishing] off the boss'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A little mouse comes [and] drags your lifeless corpse away whenever this happens. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] actually get hit several times per life. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The little 'P = 2' there is [referring to] the number of hits you have left [and] you have three lives. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the game is reasonably generous with its lives. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Altogether, there's (oh, I would say -- What is that?) eight different levels, there? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] there's a [certain amount] of variation [between the] levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This level right here obviously takes place on the ocean with {a} little boat that [can] jump up in the air, somehow. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [defeat] pirate ships, whales, uh, lightning bolts, all kinds of silly things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game [is] actually quite a bit better than "Hokuto no Ken". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's not great, but it's *certainly* reasonably *playable*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *graphics* are a lot better than "Hokuto no Ken". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The game is, uh, well {it} looks like a kids game, but [it can] actually be a bit tricky in spots. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 All those little bolts of, uh, ball lightning (whatever those are) uh, [these are] relatively difficult [to shoot] and [to] dodge! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, it's often stated that this game was [released] in the United States as "Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great Adventure". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, that's not really the case. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you've actually played both [of] these games, you'll find out they're more [or] less [completely] different games; they just happened [to] use some [of] the same sprites. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The actual level of gameplay is [quite] a bit different and, uh, "Puss 'n Boots..." does have a [lot of, sort] of, more advanced platforming features, uh, which is not surprising considering [it was] made two [years] later. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess we'll have to] consider "Puss 'n [Boots..." to] be more of a, uh, U.S.-[only] sequel to a Japan-[only] game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But I would definitely [not] consider these [to] be the same game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [here we're] back to the original, uh, "[Nagagutsu]...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, this level takes place in (oh) India(?), I believe. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The actual goal [of] this game is [to get] Pero [around] the world in 80 days. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You can] see [the little] timer going by, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [currently] have 36 days left. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We start off with 80 days. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess we really shouldn't judge this game too harshly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 While it's no, uh -- not exactly the best game [to come out on] the FamiCom, Toei [has certainly] released worse; that's for sure. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it's, uh, I suppose, reasonably playable, so [you might as] well give [it] a shot. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Moero TwinBee - Cinnamon Hakase wo Sukue! 🇯🇵 // Stinger 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 21 🇯🇵 // 1987 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, ninjas may have disappeared [from] the FamiCom, [for] the time being, but we still have plenty of Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the second-best [Shoot]-'em-Up this episode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is Konami's "Moero TwinBee..." and this game is a FamiCom-[only] sequel to Konami's Arcade game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And there's actually a plot to this game; the subtitle means something along [the] lines of 'Rescue Dr. Cinnamon!' 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And as you may [or] may not {know}, uh, Dr. Cinnamon is the scientist who [actually] created TwinBee [and his little] friends. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here [he's been kidnapped] by, well, aliens(?); I'm not really sure. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One [interesting thing about] the Japanese version is [it actually] allows for three players. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is done by using the [Japanese], uh, four-way adapter. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Konami did [realease] this game in the U.S. but, since the 'TwinBee' franchise [was not] known, they released {it} under the name "Stinger". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] if I'm [not] mistaken, this *may* have been the [only] 'TwinBee' game [to be released for] the FamiCom in the U.S. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, [in] the U.S. version the, uh -- Dr. Cinnamon's hideout, is, uh, [described as] being the Konami headquarters [and] the person being kidnapped is perhaps a... Konami designer? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game does deviate just a little bit from the original "TwinBee" game idea - in that you alternate between [horizontal and] vertical scrolling levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The first "TwinBee" game was strictly vertical-[only] levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [suppose] one thing [that] might [surprise you about this] game [is the number of crosses [that] appear [in it]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I} thought those things weren't [allowed] by [Nintendo] of America. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As before, you [collect] power-ups by shooting the clouds; [the little] bells [will] pop out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you grab them when they're gold, you'll get points. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you shoot them a certain number of times, they'll change color [and] then you'll get a power-up, depending on what color. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For example], blue [is] a speed up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm gonna hit it until it] turns silver [and] then I've got double firepower. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you'll [really] need [to] try [to] utilize a lot of power-ups in this game [if ya wanna get very] far. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} coming across the first boss, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "TwinBee" being a [Cute]-'em-Up type game, all the bosses [are] quite eccentric-looking - like, it's a, uh, watermelon shooting watermelon seeds at you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though... I'm not sure - in Japan, do watermelons have green seeds? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I should mention {that}, despite the [fact] this game is quite [cute and charming]  looking, it really is a very serious Shoot-'em-Up and is, uh, v...m... meh... -- very well-designed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some people [don't like] this game quite [as] much [as] the original "TwinBee" or some [of the] sequels because of the horizontal shooting levels, but I [think] they work relatively well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Get the little Konami logo, there, for a... [few] -- some additional points. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In the vertical levels, you'll need [to] use *both* buttons [to] fire both laser beams *and* the bombs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Collecting] the 'L' [and] the 'R' [will sort] of power [you up] again, [allowing] you [to] do, like, a rear laser [as] well [as] the front. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some [of] the [best] power-ups [are actually not] found in the *bells*, but rather by bombing things on the ground. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, we've powered up to a full-fledged death machine with Spread Shot and a *shield*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Spread Shot [can actually] make some [of] the bosses *much* easier [than] they would be [without] it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This guy, for example, [is] a piece [of] cake with the Spread Shot. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And of course, as is typical [for] games {of} this era, there is a Bonus Round where [you] simply shoot bells [and get] points. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, while "Moero TwinBee..." is, [sort] of, regarded [as] the black sheep in the 'TwinBee' family, [it's actually] a [pretty] good game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In some ways, it's more enjoyable [than the original] "TwinBee" - has a few more additional elements added into it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I would [heartily] recommend [it] if [you're looking] for a good Shooter on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On any *normal* episode, this [would probably] be... [the] -- far and away, the *best Shooter* of the episode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the 'TwinBee' series [is really], sort of, a good example of [great] games [that didn't get] released in the U.S. [for] some reason or another. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], once again, while playing this game, I am [quite impressed] by the consistent level of quality Konami gives to its *FamiCom* games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ikari 🇯🇵 // Ikari Warriors 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 26 🇯🇵 // 1987 May [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SNK | Micronics
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by KAC 🇯🇵 // SNK 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Next up is "Ikari" (or "Ikari *Warriors*", as it is known in the U.S.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [is] a port of the 1986 Arcade game and was one [of] the first *big hits* from SNK. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 'Ikari', by the way, is usually translated as 'anger' in English. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, SNK [had] already *published* one title [for] the FamiCom ("ASO..."), [but for] *some reason* "Ikari" was published by K [Amusment]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It was eventually released] in the U.S. by SNK themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the Arcade release is considered [to] be a classic Run-'n'-Gun. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It took the formula of Capcom's *"Commando"* [and added a] number of new *features*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] one, [it] had a very unusual *control* mechanism; it used a rotary joystick. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That is, the joystick actually had a knob [that could] be rotated, [so you could control your] direction of fire. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [would allow] ya [to] move in *one* direction while firing in {a} *[different]* direction. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Unfortunately*, the *FamiCom* port is not nearly as highly regarded as the Arcade release, [to] say the least. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The characters' names were either Ralf [and] Clark or Paul [and] Vince in this version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, the characters seem [to have been inspired] by John Rambo from {the} 'Rambo' movies. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Both the Arcade [and] the FamiCom version allow for 2-Player cooperative, which makes the game {a} bit more approachable. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Tryin' [to] get through [it] with one player is [virtually] impossible. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just] like in "Commando", [you] move up the screen, shooting anybody [that] gets in [your] way. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can also] throw grenades [to do] more damage. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Unlike* "Commando", you have limited bullets [and] must occasionally pick up *ammo*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing [that] is quite fun about this game is you [will] occasionally [find] vehicles (such [as] this tank here) [that] you [can] jump into. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [will] basically turn you [into] an unstoppable death machine [and] make [certain portions of] the game much easier [to] get through. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I would advise hanging onto the tank [as] long [as] possible. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can *still* be *[damaged]* by grenades and *rockets*, however. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Additionally*, you'll [find] various *power-ups* throughout the game, ([such] as, uh, speed increases, more powerful grenades, {and} that sort of thing), as *well as* more advanced power-ups, such as a *heart*, which allows ya [to] *keep* [your] *power-ups* after you *die*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, much like *"Commando"*, you [will] travel through sections, uh, separated by heavily guarded *gates*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though one feature is [the] fact [that] there's actually *bosses* [in] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, uh, [in] a few moments [we'll] come [across] a, uh, super tank. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As [you can] see, the environments in "Ikari" [are] much more varied [than] in "Commando". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You go through all kinds of unusual bridges, villages, {and} all sorts of interesting things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing [about] "Commando" is it *was [pretty]* repetitive. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here's* the first boss; you'll need [to] blow [him] up [with] your grenades. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, there *is* one really *big* difference [between] "Commando" [and] "Ikari". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And that's [that], while the *FamiCom "Commando"* is highly *regarded*, opinion on "Ikari" is *much* more *divided*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some folks actually *like* {the} game while *others* feel it's one [of] the worst games ever [released for] the [system]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I've actually *heard* "Ikari" called *the* worst Nintendo *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 More than anything else, this [might] be due [to] the difficult controls. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 With no rotary joystick, the game becomes much more [difficult to] play. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And frankly, the *controls* [in] this game are *really* not very *good*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I sometimes [found] myself throwing grenades in a different direction than I originally intended, and general aiming is somewhat tricky. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Watch this right here, for example; I'm tryin' [to] blow [that] guy up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Whoops! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, some critics had issues with the graphics [and] the sometimes weird color schemes, [not to] mention the somewhat silly looking sprites on [your] character. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The legs are -- in [particular, are] kind of goofy looking. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, much of this is [probably] due [to] the [fact that] this conversion was done by Micronics, the same [guys] who did those rather sketchy Capcom ports. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We [will] definitely see Micronics' signature sprite flicker throughout this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Still, having just played "Commando" last episode, I *really* [can't] be too *hard* on this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... *Yeah*, there are definitely [some] technical *issues* [and] there are some frustrating *moments*, but there's also a lot [of] really fun moments as *well*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... There is [definitely] a lot more gameplay *variety* in "Ikari Warriors" [than] there is in "Commando". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game is also much, much, much *longer*, maybe even a little bit too long; it's quite difficult [to actually get] through [it]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [while] this is definitely [not] a *[great* game], it's *not nearly* [as] *bad* [as] its reputation seems. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Once [ya get] the hang of the controls, you'll *[probably]* find [yourself] having a [bit] of *fun*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mappy-Land 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 26 🇯🇵 // 1989 April [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // Taxan 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, here is something [we'll] start seeing occasionally ([and] is certainly a sign [of] the growing *importance* of home *consoles* in the video game *industry*) a *console-[only] sequel* to an *Arcade* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Mappy-Land" is a *FamiCom original*, and a *sequel* to Namco's *1983* Arcade game, "Mappy", which was released, um, as {a} port on the FamiCom, way back in late 1984. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Not surprisingly], "Mappy-Land" has been given a [bit of] a "Super Mario..."-like makeover. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, Mappy journeys [through] various locales, [collecting] pieces of cheese. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You need [to collect] all the cheese [to find] the exit and then move on [to] the next level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Each level has a [different] theme ([for] example, this one here is [obviously], [sort] of, wild westy) and a different method [for] slowing down the cats [that] were chasing you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In "Mappy", you, uh, had little microwaves [that] sent, uh, waves of radiation [to] stop the cats. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] this game, ya have all sorts of things. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As in the Japanese version of "Mappy", the adult cat is named Nyamco rather than Goro. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most [of] the time "Mappy" is {a} [pretty] fun game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This level definitely has the most violent method [for] dealing [with] the cats. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya can] drop a *bomb*, it'll actually send them flying [into] the air and [then] exploding [into] tiny little pieces, which is *[pretty] gruesome*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, some [of] the elements of "Mappy" [are] actually [not very successful], such [as] this level, which is more of a traditional Platformer level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya need to] jump across vines, avoid falling [in] the water, {and} so on, {and} so forth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [actually] controls *quite* a bit differently than the rest [of] the game and feels a *little* [out] of place (sort of, like an interruption in a mostly otherwise fun game). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Then, we have this rather spooky almost "Castlevania"-like level in which you [are] armed [with] some sort of ghostbusting device [and use balloons to] fly around. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] I *liked* this level, {it} [doesn't really feel] consistent with the rest of "Mappy-Land". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this scene, right here, would seem to obviously violate Nintendo of America's rules [about religious] *symbols*, but, uh, well, there it is. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, [at] the end [of] this, uh, very first world here, you have this, uh, rather annoying little section [with] a *timed* section where [ya] have [to collect] all the pieces of *cheese* in the [shortest] possible [amount] of *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this is actually [pretty] *strict*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And I] had [to] try this several times, always being late by just a second [or] two [to] the party. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] of course, you have [to] keep trying [it] over [and] over again [until] ya finally get [it right]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 After this, ya go on [to] World 2, where [you're] collecting *rings* instead of cheese; otherwise {it's} [exactly] the same. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Mappy-Land", uh, is definitely fun [in] places, um, but [probably] a [little] too inconsistent [to be] considered a great game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo 🇯🇵 // Dragon Power 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 27 🇯🇵 // 1988 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The holiday season [can only] mean one thing in [the] video game world: lame games based on [licensed] properties. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this case, it's Akira Toriyama's extremely [popular] manga [and] anime, 'Dragon Ball'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the first of many, *many* 'Dragon Ball' [and] 'Dragon Ball Z' [video] games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, there would be *nine games* released [for] the FamiCom alone. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The series certainly [didn't get] off to a very auspicious [start with this] offering, courtesy of Bandai [and] Tose. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [We'll] be using [an] unofficial translation so [that] we [can actually] read the dialogue scenes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You play Son Goku, who is clearly based on Sun Wukong, the Monkey King. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this is [actually] the *second* Sun Wukong game [we'll be] seeing, this episode. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Ball..." bears a resemblance [to] the overworld portion of "...Zelda" - [only] this game is [pretty] linear. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 On the first level, you run around bopping guys [and] eventually [enter] a [room] with a *boss*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *bosses* on the first level are *[pretty]* straightforward - [simply] run up [and hit] 'em! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, Goku [has] a [pretty short] reach. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, unless you [found] the hidden staff weapon, yo...u'll -- you'll [probably] take some damage [every time] ya [hit him]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Ball..." *is* moderately [enhanced] by [the] addition of a few weapons [and] power-ups. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [for] some reason, Bandai liked releasing their games in the [United] States (even though they were usually based on *cartoon* series that were not well-*known*, over here). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [just] like their previous titles, "Dragon Ball..." was reworked [and] released in the U.S. as "Dragon Power". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Very [little] has actually changed, however. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The character [sprite] of Goku was changed [to] give [him, sort] of, a little monkey face. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], of course, on the American box [art], there was a s... -- completely generic karate g... -- type guy jumping around [for] some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The basic [plot] is *[pretty] much* the same, however. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, *American* gamers were still at a bit of a *disadvantage* because [without] having read the 'Dragon Ball' comic book, this game *still* didn't make any sense - even the Americanized version. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, there was ra... -- one rather notorious change made in the American version; [and that] was in the, uh, cutscene involving the [turtle] hermit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In "Dragon Ball...", this turtle hermit character, Muten Roshi, uh, demands [to] see Bulma's panties. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, this [wouldn't] fly with [Nintendo] of America's family-friendly policies, so they had [to remove] this part. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I've always [found] this [particular] scene [to] be a [little] disturbing, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As the various panties fly around his head, he appears [to start] vomiting blood(!?). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [at] any rate, in the American version, the panties were changed to *sandwiches*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, uh, the panties are actually [sort] of a power-up in the "Dragon Ball..." game; uh, [you get them and] ya [get] a burst of extra speed, [for] some reason. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, they were [actually] changed to sandwiches [consistently] throughout the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, regardless of these relatively minor changes, um, both versions are, sort of, saddled with rather irritating [and uninteresting] gameplay [for most] {of} the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, in the *next* level, ya have [to] run around looking for Oolong. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you do this by running [into] all [these little] houses and hitting on these various *figures*, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oolong is hidden *randomly* in *one* of these. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you get unlucky, this [may] *actually* take quite some *time*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Which brings up to -- another major problem with, uh, "Dragon Ball..." [and] "Dragon Power". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Namely, you have a Life Meter however [not [only] are] points deducted from the Life Meter when [ya] take *damage*, [but it's also constantly] draining [as] you play the *game*, [just] like a *timer*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Enemies* [will] sometimes drop items that will [refill] a few *life points* (and I mean literally a *few life points*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, these items are random [and aren't] dropped consistently. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This [wouldn't] be so bad [except] your Life Meter is [not refilled when] ya complete a level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, if ya took some *damage* during a *boss* fight, your odds of getting [to] the next level are *greatly diminished*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And since the life [refills] are so *random*, [you can] sometimes go a very long [time without] finding one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, if you're running low on life, [and] none of the enemies have dropped *life* refills, you're *pretty* much *screwed*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] see here, I've taken some damage [and I'm] running *quite* low on *life*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] there *really* isn't much of a chance [for] me to find any way of refilling [it, at] this point. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Dragon Ball..." boils down [to] being just another mediocre game from Tose. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I assume it sold quite well, regardless; though future 'Dragon Ball' games [would] be based on an entirely [different] formula. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Monitor Puzzle: Kineco: Kinetic Connection 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 28 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tamtex
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Hey there, Puzzle Game fans. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Irem enters the F.D.S. arena [with] this [little] game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's actually, uh, [pretty] nice music, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], this game was [not] developed by [Irem] themselves, originally. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya notice it's [licensed] from a Sadato Taneda. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure who this mysterious figure is, [but] I [can only] assume he's the guy who originally designed the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The title is, "Monitor Puzzle - Kineco - The Kinetic Connection", [but it was] also [released for] the M.S.X. by Sony as just "The Kinetic Connection". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was even released in the [United] *States* for the Commodore *64* by Electronic *Arts*, of all people. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once the game finally loads, you're taken [to] the image select screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You choose against several different, uh, images there, ranked in difficulty. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You then select how many pieces you want. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] also view the [completed] puzzle (if you'd like). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or you [can] be hardcore [and] try it without having seen the complete image. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Because we're complete wusses, [we're] going to try [it at] the easiest, uh, image setting as well [as] the smallest number of pieces. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this is a rather interesting and unique idea. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a *puzzle* (just like a jigsaw puzzle) [only] the, uh, picture's actually *moving*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You simply grab a piece, [put it in] its proper place on the, uh -- the blank screen there, [and] then, uh, continue to assemble the [picture]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Use [the] D-Pad and the, uh, B button to k... -- select a piece, then simply just pop [it into] place. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [as it] turns out, the pieces are of... -- often [not] facing the [right] direction. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can th... -- use those [buttons] to either, uh, flip them upside down or flip them horizontally. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] see there, one piece is actually, uh, backwards; [we'll] need to -- [to] flip [that] one over. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you may [have noticed, there's] a [little] *timer* there [in] the background. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] also -- You can, uh, compare how you're doing with the, uh -- the [best] score (which is, uh, currently [at] 7 [minutes and] 54 seconds). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! So, [we're] finally done here, once we flip [that last] piece. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We might think, 'Ah, this looks [pretty] simple', but of course, [this is the] very easiest [picture and] the very [easiest] setting. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The other, uh, [pictures] -- well, the game can [actually] get extremely mind-bogglingly difficult. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Let's take a look at, uh, image number 10. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then [we'll] go to the largest number [of] pieces. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And... (Oh, my God!) it's just, uh, cherry blossom leaves falling [in] the wind [or] something. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 How [can] you *[possibly]* even *consider* [putting] this thing *together*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This one is a real, uh, mind-blower; that's for sure. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... I noticed that the, d... uh -- record [time] on this was, like, an hour [and] 51 minutes for [whoever] had this disk image originally. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, uh, if you're looking for a challenging jigsaw puzzle style [video] game, uh, I guess this is the one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Castle Excellent 🇯🇵 // Castlequest 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 28 🇯🇵 // 1989 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ASCII | Bits Laboratory
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 // Nexoff 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our next [release] is known [as] "Castle Excellent" in Japan [and] "Castlequest" in the [United] *States*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was published {and} developed by ASCII (a company that seems [to] specialize [in] games [for] Japanese computers). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Castle Excellent" was [also released] on [the] M.S.X., [*at* around] the same time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now this game is, in fact, a sequel to a 1985 M.S.X. title called "The Castle". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is "The Castle", right here; "Castle Excellent" is essentially a bigger, better update on "The Castle". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... And that exactly is what the 'Excellent' in {the} title is supposed to imply. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The N.E.S. port was actually handled by Bits Laboratory. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We'd probably classify 'The Castle' games [as] Puzzlish Platformers (similar [in] feel [to] "Lode Runner"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *goal* is simply [to get] through the various [interconnected] rooms in this maze-like *castle* [and] rescue a *princess*, avoiding the many, many *monsters* [and] *hazards* [found in] every single *room*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Altogether*, there [are] 100 rooms. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *catch* is [that] the doors *[between]* the rooms are *locked*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [will] need a key of the [correct] *color* [in] order [to] *open* a door [and the] keys [will actually] disappear after one *use*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As a [result], [there's a lot] of trial [and error in] this game, since you often [don't] know what's in the next room [until] ya open it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And since the keys [are], in general, in very short supply, [you'll] often find yourselves trapped [and] have [to start] over. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game was [also released] in [the United *States*] by *Nexoft*, which was simply a division of ASCII [used] for [releasing] carts in the [United] *States*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The cover made [it] look more like a standard Fantasy Adventure type game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The main difference was [that] you had many more lives in the U.S. version. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You're quite [vulnerable to] monster attacks [and even] though you have a [extremely short] dagger with virtually, uh, no reach at all, you *will* occasionally be able to defend yourselves [against] the enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some monsters (such as that green guy with a pink hat) are not -- not able [to] be [harmed] by [your] swords; you'll simply have to avoid [them]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing I *don't* like about "Castle Excellent" is the controls [are pretty] screwy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] jump, but you can actually, sort of, levitate in the air for a second. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [However], in general, I [find it sorta] difficult to jump correctly; and some [of] the, uh, obstacles [in] this game do require some *very* [precise] jumping. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I found myself getting killed quite frequently, trying [to] jump over things. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Despite the fact that] the U.S. version gives [you] a *whole bunch* of *lives*, I found myself dying very frequently [and] using up the lives [pretty] quickly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, while "Castlequest" is a [pretty] cool game, just expect to run [into] dead ends quite frequently. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it's [probably] gonna take you quite a while [to] get all the way through the game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Zanac AI 🇯🇵 // Zanac 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 28 🇯🇵 // 1987 October [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Compile
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 // FCI 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [we've] seen a [lot] of Shoot-'em-Ups on the FamiCom so far, but finally we've come to one of the all-time great Shoot-'em-Ups [for] the system, "Zanac" (or "Zanac A.I." to give the full title). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Zanac A.I." is a [revised] version of an] earlier [1986] M.S.X. game (which we see here). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Zanac*" was [pretty] decent for [an] *M.S.X.* title, [but] the *FamiCom* version *[really]* took the console S... -- Shooter to a whole new level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 First [of] all, we should [note that] "Zanac" is an early [title] from *Compile*, which would go on [to] become perhaps the greatest developer of Shooters [for] home systems. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *one* [of] the things [about] Compile is they were real technical *wizards*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *"Zanac"* somehow manages to [present] *very* fast *gameplay* with a *large* number of *sprites* while avoiding flicker [and] sh... uh -- slowdown. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 How this was accomplished, I really have no *idea* but compare this to a *Micronics* title (such as *"SonSon"*) [and] see the difference [between] good [and] bad programming [for] the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Even more [surprisingly], "Zanac" utilizes a relatively aggressive, sort of, A.I. where the game becomes more [difficult], [depending] on [how] ya play it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, grabbing the *shield* power-up (like I've done here) will cause all sorts of [difficult enemies to] flood the screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Suddenly, all these missiles end up being [shot at] you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The shield is one of several secondary weapons found throughout the game [and] you [can] also, uh, use the primary *laser*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this [can] be upgraded by occasionally shooting those little blocks [and] getting the glowing, uh, orbs that appear [out] of them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's one [of] the many *bosses* [in] the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Defeating him [will require] ya {to} shoot at all the little, uh, laser-firing vents, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Early levels like this are [pretty] simple but, uh, get a few levels [into] the game [and] suddenly [it] becomes [pretty] hectic. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [power]-ups [that] you [get in] the game are all quite [different]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, this shield is quite *handy* for [protecting you] against enemy *fire* [but]... then you're stuck using your, uh, regular *laser* weapon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And of course, [the] laser weapon does get better the more [you] upgrade it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you defeated this enemy, you'll then go on [to] the next level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's [sort] of a [little], uh, warp animation, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, I guess [that's pretty] cool. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, your actual secondary weapon is selected by shooting those various numbers, like the '3' [you just] saw, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And if you, uh, collect the same number [repeatedly], it'll power up your secondary weapon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And definitely some [are] more useful [than] the others. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here, apparently, I've been killed [and] I'm stuck using my, uh, primary secondary weapon or my laser, which is, uh -- the [primary secondary weapon] is this sort of -- this little ball of [energy that] shoots out - really [not that] great. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now really "Zanac" is [one of the first] Shoot-'em-Ups [to have sort] of a modern style variety of weapons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... There's actually (oh, what? I think, uh) seven or so in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, number three is this, sort of, [protective] energy ball [that] circles around you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These *kind* of things would become *[pretty]* common [in] Shoot-'em-Ups, but really weren't seen [that] frequently, at least at this point. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] see, there's [quite] a few opportunities to, uh, collect power-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, for this boss, [I'm actually] using, uh, this, [sort] of, oscillating ring, here, which will destroy (or at least damage) [any] enemies [it] hits. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... It does also make [quite] a few, uh, enemies appear when ya use it, unfortunately; but [it] can [be pretty] useful for, uh, killing *bosses*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, um, one thing about "Zanac" [that] does make this game a [little bit] on the [difficult side] is that, if you die when you have a *power-up* you'll *still* be stuck with the, uh -- the more aggressive enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... For example, if I were [to] die, like, right here (like I [just] did) it's t... -- going [to] make killing this boss *very*, very difficult because the *sheer* number of enemies [that] appear on the screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So], yes, "Zanac" *can* be *[pretty] cruel*, at times. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Regardless*, "Zanac" is still one [of] the best most-loved Shooters for the FamiCom [and an] early classic from Compile. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Karate Champ 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 22 🇯🇵 // 1986 November [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, here we have, [sort] of, a curiosity, "Karate [Champ]" by Data East. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a port of a very [popular] 1984 *Arcade* game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The original Arcade game [would] go down in -- in the history books [as] being the first real one-on-one Fighting Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {You} used a rather unique double joystick configuration [to perform] moves, as shown here during the demonstration screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} was also one [of] the first games to prominently use human speech. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game came [out] in, uh -- [sometime in the] middle [of 1984], thus [beating out] Nintendo's own FamiCom title, "Urban Champion". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps you [remember], "Urban Champion", [from] "Chrontendo Episode 2". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Karate Champ" was one [of] the first third-party games [to] be released in the [United] *States*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Bandai had [released a] few titles [in] *October*, Capcom released three in *[November*, and] *Data East* [released] "Tag Team Wrestling" [and] *"Karate Champ"*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike all those *other* games, however, *"[Karate] Champ"* had not [yet] been released in *Japan*; it was released directly [to] the U.S. *market*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Thus *Data East* was the first third-party *publisher* [to release] the games [specifically] *for* the U.S. (just as Nintendo [had] done earlier [with] "Gumshoe"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, Data East *did* eventually decide [to release] this in Japan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] came out [for] the FamiCom Disk System in 1988. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Presumably] they had really nothing *else* good [to release, at] that time, [because it's] hard to imagine this making much [of] a stir. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Data East's home conversion had to obviously dramatically alter the controls set up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [perform] a move by hitting one [of] the buttons [and then] D-Pad, *sort of, like* a modern *Fighting* Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can perform] various high [and] low kicks. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] there's no *Life Bar*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Whoever makes the first *[hit]* wins a *point*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you accumulate a certain number of *points*, you win a *round*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then you [will] get a rather annoying *Bonus Round* (which I can't seem to get anywhere with); [it] involves flowerpots being thrown [at] you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, much like later Fighting Games, "Karate Champ", uh, the g... -- rounds take place in different locales, such as a mountain top, a city alley, a jungle, et cetera. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, Fighting Games [pretty] much live [or] die by [their] controls; and this is "Karate Champ"'s major failing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Having the double joystick configuration allowed for [around] 20 different combinations of joystick [positions]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The D-Pad/two buttons setup *doesn't really* work nearly as *well*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The control system is very awkward [and] confusing [and] I found [it to] be very difficult to [successfully execute] moves. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, often when I tried [to execute] the *high* kick, I would merely jump up [in] the air instead. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, the [hit detection] is very *baffling*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's *often* not *clear* what counts [as] a [hit and] what doesn't. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, unfortunately, "Karate Champ" really fails [to] live up to its potential; and I don't think Fighting Game fans [are] going to enjoy this one very much. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tiger-Heli 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 05 🇯🇵 // 1987 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Toaplan | Micronics
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 // Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] last we've [reached] December 1986 and [we'll] celebrate by looking [at] this Vertical Shoot-'em-Up, "Tiger-Heli". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Released] by *Pony Canyon* in Japan and *Acclaim* in the [United] *States*, this is a [port of] the 1985 Arcade game, [designed] by none other than *Toaplan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *fact*, I believe "Tiger-Heli" was Toaplan's first *Shoot-'em-Up*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] the Arcade version, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] nice [little] Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing [that's] a little *unusual* is [that all your] enemies [are] actually *land*-based. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You mostly fight tanks [and] *ships* [and] whatnot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] also destroy civilian vehicles [and] houses [as] well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} not really sure what the plot [of] this game is, but it seems you're [some sort] of maniacal helicopter pilot [pretty] much-killing everybody you see. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This conversion was once again done by *Micronics*, who seem to be the guys [to] go-to for cheap [and] dirty conversions at this point. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still*, the game is not all bad [and] does have some nice graphical details like the actual *shadow* underneath your *helicopter*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Aside from your *missiles*, you have a *very limited* mega bomb. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It'll blow up *most things* on the ground but not everything; it has a r... -- limited range. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you [can] also get *power-ups*, uh, [that] mostly are [actually little] mini helicopters that attach themselves [to your] side [and] sh... -- [fly] along [with] you (kind of like in Capcom's '1940' games). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If this game [reminds] you a [little bit] of "Gyrodine" then it's because Toaplan was, sort of, a spin-off from [Crux] (the company [that developed] "Gyrodine"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, Toaplan would *eventually* go on [to] specialize in Shoot-'em-Ups [and release] {a} number of well-[loved] titles such as "Twin Cobra", "Slap Fight", "Zero Wing", "Batsugun", and so on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Zero Wing", as you might recall, received quite a bit of notoriety a few years ago when a line of *dialogue* from the *Mega Drive* version, 'All your base are belong to us' become a frequently [referenced] quote on the Internet. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Toaplan eventually [went out] of business [in] 1994 but former employees kind of kept the spirit alive with other Shoot-'em-Up developers such as CAVE [and] Eighting. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Tiger-Heli" is definitely not the most original [Shoot]-'em-Up you'll ever see. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, it [will] remind you [quite] a [bit] of games like "1942". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But it's still [quite] a [bit] of fun [and can] actually be quite tricky [and] challenging in spots. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here we [see the] little helper helicopter guys and, uh, unfortunately [you're also] going to see a bit of, uh, Micronics' notorious, uh, sprite flicker, here and there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This becomes especially bad in the, uh -- the *boss fight* coming up [in] a [little bit], here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Most of the enemies are relatively slow-moving, but there sometimes *can* be quite a *few* of them {and} they *also* tend to sneak up behind you as well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 All in all, I'd say this is definitely [not] a [great] game like *"Zanac"* but it *certainly* is *playable*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One wishes [that] Micronics [had] done a [better] job. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here we're coming up to, uh, one [of] the bosses; it's these two large tanks [and], as you [can] see, there's enough flicker here [to] give you a seizure. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, the bosses [don't] really explode [or] anything when you shoot them; they just, sort of, shut down. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, if you're a *Shoot*-'em-Up fan, it's definitely worth a [bit of your] time [to] take a look [at] this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Daiva: Imperial of Nirsartia 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 05 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by T&E Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toshiba EMI 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's another game published by the Japanese *record* company, Toshiba EMI. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And so far, they [haven't] really been known [for] putting [out quality] games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game, "Daiva" (or "Daiva: Imperial of Nirsartia"), is a bit of an oddity. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Daiva" was [developed] by T&E Soft (who have their name proudly displayed on the box cover) [and] they're the same guys [who] made "Hydlide", so really they shouldn't be bragging [too] much. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 At first glance, this looks, sorta, like a "Star Raiders" ripoff, which it *is*, but with a *twist*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You see, the unusual thing about this game is one of seven games in the 'Daiva' series [that] was released almost simultaneously [around] this time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is number six [in] the series. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Each *game* was released on a different Japanese *system* such as the M.S.X., the M.S.X. 2, the PC-88, [and] so on, [and] so forth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, there is nothing on the Sega Master System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This, right here, is the M.S.X. 2 version. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The overall, uh, idea is *similar*, though this game seems a [bit] more *complex*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, at the same time, there was released a comic book, {and} a soundtrack album. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, there was really quite a media blitz behind this unique concept of releasing seven games [at] once. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Presumably, they were [expecting] it [to] do [pretty] well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And you] might be a *little* surprised [to] learn [that] "Daiva" was one [of] the *pricier* FamiCom games released so far at, uh, ¥5500 yen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, back [to the] FamiCom version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You select a planet from the [map screen and actually have to] manually, uh, pilot [your] ship there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then you decide where ya wanna drop the missiles, the health refill, [and] the bomb. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You can] place them at certain points along {a} level, giving "Daiva" sort of a, uh, certain Strategy element. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the twist on the "Star Raiders" idea. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Each planet is a forced scrolling, uh, Platformer shooting type deal. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, you wouldn't [expect anything] *too awesome* from the makers of *"Hydlide"*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, these levels are a [little bit on] the lame side. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Basically ya, [sort] of, have [your little kind] of, uh -- a 'Gundam'-style armored suit, there to, sort of, move around on these rather, uh, slippery... surfaces, [and pretty] much shoot everything and, uh, avoid any enemy *fire*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You're -- There's no [really] *points* [or] anything [like *that*], so [I'm] not [really] sure what the *[incentive]* is [for actually *shooting*] things. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the missiles kicking in; they just fly across the screen [and, sort] of, blow up anything [they] come across. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] we're now coming near the end [of] the level and there's my health refil... -- uh, refill; it'll fill up my -- my shield, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And finally, here is the *boss*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [sort] of an odd [plant] creature; um, ya [need] {to} [shoot] all the [little] *flowers* that [are] found at the ends of its tendrils. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've taken care of this guy (it's really not that difficult) uh, [you're] then back [to] the map [and you're] on to the next planet! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] as you [can] see, there [are], uh, [quite] a few there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And there's] *really* no significant difference [between any of] the planets (at least none that I've seen, so far). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Notice, just like "Hydlide", uh, T&E Soft has, sort of, a -- a fetish for putting the name [of] the game on the main, uh, playing screen, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once again, ya put in [your] bombs, [and] missiles, [and] so on, [and] then you use {the} next planet, and it's, you know -- they're all [pretty] -- quite similar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They maybe have, sort of, *slightly* different *themes*, but *really*, not a whole lot changes. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, there's also these odd [little] *Battle Mode* sections, where the -- you sort of fight enemy ships in what [appears to] be a very primitive turn-based Strategy minigame. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is probably the] most intriguing element of "Daiva", since Strategy Games would eventually become very *[popular]* on home consoles in Japan; and this is really one [of] the very first *hints* of that *genre*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But not {that} this Battle Mode [is actually] any *good*, however. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... "Daiva", like a lot of titles of this era, shows *promise* by [introducing] creative *ideas*, but ultimately fails, due [to] bad execution. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The bottom line is [that] the individual sections aren't very well handled [and] the game ends up being, sort of, boring [and repetitive]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Transformers: Convoy no Nazo 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 05 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ISCO
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Takara 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you may have gathered, "...Convoy no Nazo" was a 'Transformers' game, the first 'Transformers' game, [as] a matter of fact. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Don't] get too excited, however, because "...Mystery of Convoy" (or 'Comvoy' with an 'M', as the box art says) is a *horrible*, horrible game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is what [will] happen the first time ya try {to} play it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Probably]* within [around] two seconds of *starting*, a Decepticon will *fly* right [into] you [and] *kill* you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [will probably] happen a *few* times [and] then you'll [put] the game away, which is the correct thing [to] do because [this is] really a terrible game [and] no one in their right mind [would] wanna *play* this [piece of] crap. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The developer, ISCO, has made this game unreasonably hard by means of some rather bizarre *decisions* on their part. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For [example], shooting a Decepticon jet [will] cause it [to] transform [into its robot] form. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can't actually *shoot* these [robots] because [your] laser simply sails over their heads. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In your vehicle form, shooting the jets will cause them [to] transform [and] *land* on you, instantly *killing* you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the first thing you'll learn [while] playing this game is [to] n... -- [not] try [to] kill the enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Rather, just avoid them by jumping over them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still*, enemies [will] often slam [into] you, from off screen while you're in mid-*jump*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, when you [shoot] an enemy, [it] *seems* [to] have a brief monen... -- moment of [invulnerability], while it transforms. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, *you*, [will] be [instantly] killed [with] one hit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] *very slowly* transform from your robot form [to your] *firetruck* form, but *neither form* is actually very *effective* [at] killing *enemies*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's a good example of what happens when you try [to shoot] a [jet] as [it] passes over you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 From what I've seen of this game, this is actually the rule rather than the exception. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Enemies [are literally impossible to hit at] times [and are constantly] taking cheap shots at you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your character's capabilities [are] very limited. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In [robot] form, he [can only] shoot straight ahea... -- straight forward [and] jump. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fire engine form, he [can [only] shoot straight] up [and] a very worthless [little], uh, bomb thing he [can shoot out] in front of [him]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Actually] trying [to] play through all nine levels [of] this game would take an enormous [amount] of dedication. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Watch here [as] I try [to] shoot this Decepticon robot running towards me. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The shot will [actually just] pass [right] through him. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yet a second ago, I killed a different robot, uh, at about the same distance [and] the shot blew him up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess [this is just] incredibly bad hit detection? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, we come [to] the first level boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [is another] one [of] those bosses [that can *only]* take *damage* when you *shoot* him right in the center of [his] eye. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We've all seen variations [of] this a million *times* but, *[because]* this character -- [your] character is so hard [to] control, it's actually incredibly annoying trying [to] actually [hit the] guy in the eye. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Transformers: Mystery of Convoy" is the FamiCom debut from the publisher [Takara] (an enormous Japanese *toy* company that *actually created* the toy lines that were known in the U.S. [as] 'Transformers'). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Eventually* these toys were rebranded [as] 'Transformers' in Japan as *well*, (though, [for] some reason, Optimus Prime was renamed Convoy). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ISCO is a little-known Japanese *contract* developer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And if this is the sort of work that they turn out, they should really be ashamed of themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While "Transformers..." is, in some sense, [better than] "Ganso Saiyuki..." this is still a [pretty] wretched game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hottaman no Chisoko Tanken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 05 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Use
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Use 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In what's starting [to] be a 'Chrontendo' tradition, our last game, "Hottāman no [Chitei] Tanken", is *somewhat of a disappointment*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The name being something along the lines of '[Hottāman's] Underground Exploration'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it is the debut FamiCom game from [Use]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You probably haven't heard of them [and] I [can't] really tell you much about [Use] other [than] they're a minor Japanese publisher of no [particular] renown. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Obviously*, this game was inspired by *"Dig Dug"*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [don't] have a pump; you have some [sort] of little laser beam. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [you can, sort] of, think of "Hottaman..." [as] being, [sort] of, an amped-up version of "Dig Dug". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or maybe you [can] think of [it as, sort] of, "Dig Dug" [cluttered up] by a bunch of unnecessary *elements*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In "Hottaman...", you don't just dig around, killing monsters; you [actually are] looking for keys (there's one right there). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] once you have *four* keys, you [can] actually open up the *exit door* [and] go on [to] the next *level*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's also these little *caves* that'll randomly warp you someplace [around] the level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Often, they warp you back to the [exact] same cave [that] you entered into. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [actually], uh, certain elements of this game [might remind] you of "Bomberman". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can occasionally, uh, [find] little bombs [that allow] ya to blow up things. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Whoops! I got fried there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the fact these, sort of, need to, uh, [perform] a [certain] number of actions for the exit [to] finally appear here is (ah, there it is right there) -- is also, sort of, taken from "Bomberman". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When we start this first level here, [we'll] see a key [that] you'll need a bomb [to] get to. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] there [are] other things you [collect], as well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a [little] drill thing there, [that'll] speed you up a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The eggs sometimes have helpful [items] in them; they often have monsters. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll need [to] utilize [the] warp caves in this level, [in order to] find all the keys. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this [isn't] really a *horrible* game; it's just, sort of, an *uninspired* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, quite frankly, "Dig Dug" is more *fun* [than] this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I don't [really] think the [addition] of *power-ups*, [and] keys, [and] those, [sort of], things actually makes this game any [sort] of *improvement* on "Dig Dug". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... It's basically one [of] those games [that] just, sort of, uh, exists for no reason other than to, uh, put something on the shelves [and] have people, uh, pay money for. 🍇🍌
