👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 6 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 In "...Episode 5" 🍋 of 'Chrontendo' 🍊 we chronicled what 🍋 was definitely a very 🍋 exciting time for Nintendo 🍊 - the release of 🍋 "Super Mario Bros." 🍊 and the N.E.S. in 🍋 the United States. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, "...Episode 6" 🍊 is not going [to] see 🍋 anything as spectacular. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, some [of] 🍋 the very worst games 🍋 for the FamiCom 🍊 are gonna be released, 🍋 right around this time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On the plus side, 🍋 we're goin' [to] see a game 🍊 that's highly 🍋 influential in Japan 🍊 (though not very w... -- 🍋 well-known in the U.S.). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And we're also gonna 🍋 take a look at a game 🍊 that's rather misunderstood. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 1985 would have the 🍋 third holiday season 🍋 for the FamiCom 🍊 so Nintendo was 🍋 putting out games 🍊 for the FamiCom 🍋 at a frantic pace. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were actually 🍋 17 games released 🍋 in December of 1985 - 🍊 far more than any month 🍋 we've seen previously. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 BurgerTime 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 November 27 🇯🇵 // 1987 May 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // Data East 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Alright, kids, 🍊 first up this episode 🍋 is "BurgerTime". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a port of 🍊 Data East's 1982 🍋 hit Arcade game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And oh my, just dig 🍋 that crazy music. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some video game music 🍋 walks the fine line 🍊 between annoying 🍋 and catchy, and 🍊 that is the perfect way 🍋 [to] describe this music. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 While playing this game, 🍋 I kind of hate this music, 🍊 but damn, if it doesn't 🍋 put me in the mood 🍊 [to] run around 🍋 stomping on hamburgers. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, for those not 🍋 familiar with this game, 🍊 you are Peter Pepper, 🍋 a chef trying [to] 🍊 construct some 🍋 giant hamburgers, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, the 🍋 own ingredients 🍊 in your kitchen 🍋 are trying [to] kill you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {You} have some 🍋 sausages and some eggs 🍊 chasing after you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your [only] defense is, uh, 🍊 you can sprinkle 🍋 some pepper on 'em 🍊 that'll temporarily 🍋 blind 'em, I guess. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, you 🍋 can also crush them 🍊 with, uh, 🍋 the hamburger buns, 🍊 and the lettuce, 🍋 and the meat. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you walk on 'em, {and} 🍊 it drops on top [of] them, 🍋 it will, uh, kill them, 🍊 and they'll re-materialize 🍋 a second later. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you saw there a second ago, 🍊 sometimes their 🍋 re-materialization 🍊 is not [to] your advantage. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game was 🍋 released by Namco 🍊 for the FamiCom in Japan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I think it was actually 🍋 developed by Data East. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When this came out in the U.S. 🍊 (and it did eventually 🍋 come out for the N.E.S. 🍋 in {the} United States) 🍊 it was released by 🍋 Data East, themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is a 🍋 [pretty] accurate port. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I believe there was a 🍊 not-so-good version 🍋 of this for the 2600, 🍊 probably other 🍋 consoles as well, 🍊 I d... -- 🍋 I don't actually recall. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, 🍊 I'm sure this is the best 🍋 version for home consoles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The controls are actually 🍋 a little sticky at times; 🍊 sometimes I have a hard time 🍋 getting [onto] the ladders, 🍊 but it's a -- 🍋 it's a [pretty] good port. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ikki 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 November 28 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And here we have a game that 🍋 you probably haven't heard of, 🍊 the Japanese-[only] "Ikki". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We have the rousing 🍋 and rather long 🍊 little introduction 🍋 music, there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, 'ikki' means 'revolt'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And what it's referring to 🍋 is a time in medieval Japan 🍊 when, uh, farmers 🍋 and peasants were, 🍊 sort of, fed up of 🍋 their Samurai overlords 🍊 and started doing 🍋 little revolts. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was actually, uh, 🍋 apparently [pretty] common 🍊 for a little while. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, that's what 🍋 this game is about! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You are a farmer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have what appears 🍋 [to] be a scythe, 🍊 which you throw at, 🍋 uh, the ninjas 🍊 that're being sent 🍋 to quell the revolt. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 How exactly are you revolting, 🍋 other than by killing ninjas? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, you're grabbing 🍋 a lot of gold coins, 🍋 first of all. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] not really sure 🍋 why the gold coins 🍊 are just laying 🍋 around in the fields. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But the object is [to] pick up 🍋 each [of] the gold coins 🍊 found in each level, 🍊 and then ya move on 🍋 [to] the next level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is actually a port 🍋 of a [Sunsoft] ga... -- 🍊 Arcade game from 1985, 🍋 and, ya know, 🍊 this actually 🍋 looks [pretty] good. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It controls kind of weird; 🍋 your weapon, sort of, like, 🍊 automatically hones 🍋 [onto] the nearest enemy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... 🍋 And the enemies' weapons, 🍊 sort of, do 🍋 the same [to] you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing that's 🍋 a little odd is that, uh, 🍊 the enemies, sort of, 🍋 appear out of nowhere, 🍊 especially around the -- 🍋 the top of the screen, 🍊 so it's [pretty] easy 🍋 [to] get killed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, you'll 🍋 be walking around; 🍊 suddenly, bam, 🍊 there's a ninja with a star 🍋 being thrown right at you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And there's [also], 🍋 uh, other enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like, these little 🍋 demons come out 🍊 that sort of paralyze you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's some guys actually 🍋 shooting at you, there! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's not a terribly 🍋 interesting little game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's not *terrible*; 🍊 it's sort of amusing [to] 🍋 play for a little while, I guess. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One [of] the most 🍋 interesting things about this 🍊 is that it takes place 🍋 in medieval Japan, 🍊 which we haven't really seen 🍊 a whole lot of 🍋 video games do this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, later, this 🍋 [would] become a, ya know, 🍊 big subject for 🍋 Japanese video games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Both games taking place 🍋 in feudal Japan, 🍊 as well as 🍋 medieval China as well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Think of all those, uh, 🍊 'Three Kingdoms' games 🍋 that come out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's interesting that 🍋 Japanese developers were 🍊 startin' [to] think of 🍋 new subject matter 🍊 for video games, 🍋 around this time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That, and the fact 🍋 this game uses a lot of, 🍊 uh, vertical and 🍋 horizontal scrolling, 🍊 make it kind of unique 🍋 for the time period. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The scrolling is certainly 🍋 much better than "Challenger". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 November 29 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Chunsoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Enix 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this is certainly 🍋 the most interesting game 🍊 we'll be seeing 🍋 in today's episode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Certainly, starts out 🍊 with an unusual [and] 🍋 almost startling beginning - 🍊 the sound of {a} police siren 🍋 getting louder [and] louder; 🍊 then the title appears. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I} don't know if there's 🍊 ever been an N.E.S. intro 🍋 quite like this one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game was 🍋 [only] released in Japan, 🍊 but there was an unofficial 🍋 English translation. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, we'll actually be 🍋 taking a look at that, 🍊 so we can understand what's 🍋 going on in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The name of this game is 🍊 "Portopia Renzoku 🍋 Satsujin Jiken". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But in English, 🍋 we call it, 🍊 'The Portopia 🍋 Serial Murder Case'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And if this game certainly 🍋 doesn't look like anything else 🍊 that's been released 🍋 on the FamiCom so far, 🍊 that's because it really is 🍊 the first Adventure Game 🍋 released for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This genre would become 🍋 quite [popular] in Japan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As far as I know, 🍊 this is almost certainly the 🍋 first Japanese Adventure Game 🍊 (or at least the first popular 🍋 Japanese Adventure Game). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Its influence in Japan is, 🍋 ya know, quite enormous. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The Adventure Game 🍋 has been around 🍊 since the earliest days 🍋 of computer gaming. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was actually a 🍋 [pretty] popular genre 🍊 in the early [to] mid-'80s 🍋 in the United States. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But in Japan, it really 🍋 took {on} a life of its own, 🍊 mostly thanks [to] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Later, we'll see 🍋 a lot [of] games 🍊 that [pretty] much 🍋 copy this directly. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And later, different genres 🍋 would sort of branch off 🍊 like the Visual Novel 🍊 and the various 🍋 Japanese porno games 🍊 that still exist, 🍋 [to] this day. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this game 🍋 virtually single-handedly 🍊 created a new -- 🍋 new genre in Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 How you actually 🍋 play this game 🍊 is you use your D-Pad [to] 🍋 navigate around the menu. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The little square 🍋 with the graphic 🍊 is what you're looking 🍋 at, at this moment. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can use a magnifying glass 🍋 [to] get a closer look at things, 🍊 and you'll often find 🍋 hidden objects. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, 🍋 this is necessary 🍊 to actually [really] 🍋 get through the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can look for clues, 🍋 pick up clues, 🍊 find out information 🍋 about various suspects 🍋 and other people involved, 🍊 ask people questions, 🍋 go [to] the police headquarters, 🍊 call in suspects, 🍋 and question them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If you perform 🍋 the right actions, 🍊 eventually, people will 🍋 usually give you 🍋 some more information. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, you actually 🍊 have [to] hit this guy 🍋 with [your] little hammer, 🍊 in order [to] get 🍋 [him to] confess. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} turns out 🍋 he's not the murderer; 🍊 he's just a drug dealer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There are numerous 🍋 red herrings 🍊 that pop up 🍋 throughout this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, 🍊 there's also an 🍋 interesting sense of humor 🍊 that appears 🍋 throughout this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, 🍊 if you hit Yasu in 🍋 the head with a hammer, 🍊 he'll make 🍋 funny little comments. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Let's talk a little bit about 🍋 the history of this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was originally released 🍋 for Japanese NEC computers, 🍊 back in 1983. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The game was originally 🍋 designed by Chunsoft, 🍊 who, as ya might 🍋 recall from earlier, 🍊 consists of Yuji Horii 🍋 but also Koichi Nakamura. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Previously, Chunsoft had 🍋 released "Door Door", 🍊 which was by Enix. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is also by Enix; 🍊 it's the second Enix game 🍋 for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The original Computer version 🍊 actually had you using the 🍋 keyboard [to] type in commands. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, 🍋 for the FamiCom port, 🍊 this wasn't possible, 🍋 so they used the, uh -- 🍊 the arrow and button 🍋 control scheme. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This became quite popular, 🍋 and later 🍊 Japanese Adventure Games 🍋 would all use this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Even nowadays, 🍊 Adventure Games and porno games 🍋 for the Japanese computers 🍊 have you use, uh, the arrows 🍋 to -- to scroll around, 🍊 rather than actually 🍋 typing in commands. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This FamiCom version 🍋 would prove quite popular, 🍊 apparently selling around 🍋 700,000 copies in Japan, 🍊 so it was a [pretty] 🍋 substantial hit! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Chunsoft's next game 🍋 after this would be 🍋 "Dragon Quest", 🍊 which would be 🍋 an even huger hit. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Reportedly, while 🍋 in the United States, 🍊 Horii played the early 🍋 U.S. R.P.G., "Wizardry", 🍊 which contains 🍋 a lot of first-person 🍊 scrolling around mazes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This inspired him [to] 🍋 put a maze in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's actually 🍋 later on in the game; 🍊 we'll see a little 🍋 bit of it later. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is actually 🍋 the part of the game 🍊 where most players find 🍋 it [pretty] frustrating, 🍊 because ya, sort of, 🍋 have to find your way 🍊 through a first-person 🍋 maze with no map. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, of course, 🍋 if you actually go ahead 🍊 and play this game 🍋 in the English translation, 🍊 you'll probably 🍋 wanna take notes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's actually 🍋 quite a few 🍋 things [to] remember. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game is sort of 🍋 a Puzzle Game; 🍊 you sort of have [to] 🍋 logically figure things out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [However], one criticism 🍋 you might have 🍋 about this game 🍊 (and about these sorts 🍋 of games, in general) 🍊 is that they don't always 🍋 involve puzzles so much, 🍊 but just sort of randomly 🍋 trying every single option, 🍊 until you find 🍋 the right one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Some [of] the things 🍋 that you have [to] do 🍊 in order [to] progress 🍋 in this game 🍊 are, ya know, 🍋 completely [rational], 🍊 but others just seem 🍋 sort of random, 🍋 quite frankly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, this criticism 🍋 can be extended [into] 🍊 contemporary Japanese 🍋 Adventure Games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They're not so much games 🍋 as, ya know, Visual Novels, 🍊 in which you have [to] 🍋 press just buttons [to], 🍊 sort of, get [to] 🍋 the next line of text. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I won't show you 🍋 the ending of this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There is a unexpected plot 🍋 twist at the end, of course. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I} don't wanna spoil it 🍊 for anyone who actually 🍋 might play the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But, overall, this game is 🍋 actually [pretty] satisfying, 🍊 and I would definitely 🍋 recommend it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Certainly, it's the most 🍋 historically important game 🍊 we're looking at 🍋 this episode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [while] it's 🍋 maybe not quite 🍊 {at} the same level 🍋 as "...Mario Bros.", 🍊 this was a game that had 🍋 a huge influence in Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And we're going [to] see a lot 🍋 of detective Adventure Games 🍊 for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, 🍋 most [of] them have not 🍊 been translated [into] 🍋 English, like this one has. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Karateka 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 05 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Soft Pro 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is "Karateka", 🍊 a port of a 1984 game 🍋 originally for the Apple II. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, it was 🍋 designed by Jordan Mechner, 🍊 the man who would later go on 🍋 [to] develop "Prince of Persia". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Karateka" is 🍋 a very unusual game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It really doesn't resemble 🍋 any other game of the time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Play-wise, it's sort of 🍋 a cross between 🍊 a Beat-'em-Up and 🍋 a Fighting Game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You move from left [to] right, 🍋 battling an endless 🍊 (uh, or seemingly endless) 🍊 parade of enemies 🍋 just like a Beat-'em-Up, 🍊 but you actually 🍋 fight them one-on-one, 🍊 very much like a Fighting Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have health meters, 🍊 and unfortunately, 🍋 your health meter 🍊 does not get [replenished] 🍋 after each battle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, ya sort of have to 🍊 conserve your health 🍋 very carefully. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There really aren't any 🍋 healing items in this game, 🍊 as far as I know. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the game uses these 🍋 unusual cinematic, uh, 🍊 transitions between 🍋 you moving forward 🍊 and the enemies 🍋 moving towards you 🍊 that's really 🍋 quite unusual. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You use the D-Pad [to] 🍋 control, uh, your stance; 🍊 you have, like, 🍋 a Running stance 🍋 and a Fighting stance. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you're not in 🍋 the Fighting stance 🍊 when a enemy hits you, 🍋 then it's instant death. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The object [of] the game 🍊 is [to] get all the way 🍋 [to] the far right-hand side 🍊 and, ya know, rescue 🍋 the princess or whatever 🍊 and just basically kill off 🍋 everyone who's in your way. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have both 🍋 kicks and punches, 🍊 but kicks are quite 🍋 a bit more useful, 🍊 simply because they 🍋 have a longer reach. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And actually, at least on a 🍋 lot [of] the earlier enemies, 🍊 you can sort of spam them, 🍊 simply by kicking them 🍋 over and over again. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And there is also, 🍋 of course, 🍊 the annoying bird 🍋 that tends to shave 🍊 little bits and pieces 🍋 off your life bar. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Visually, this game 🍋 is very unique! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It actually uses some sort of 🍋 rotoscoped type of animation! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It really gives it 🍋 a very interesting look 🍊 because the movements are 🍋 so lifelike and -- and smooth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You perhaps really 🍊 can't completely see 🍋 that in this video. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Like a lot [of] games 🍋 [of] this vintage, 🍊 it is not afraid 🍋 to fuck with you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, the gate. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you try [to] 🍋 walk through it, 🍊 it will drop down 🍋 and instantly kill you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Getting through that 🍋 gate is actually 🍊 quite difficult 🍋 and frustrating. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, 🍋 the fighting system 🍋 is not very deep. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, like I said, 🍋 can sort of be, uh, 🍊 you can sort of spam your way 🍋 through a lot of enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That really, sort of, 🍋 uh, takes points off 🍊 what would be a 🍋 very interesting game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If [only] the fighting system 🍋 were a little bit better, 🍊 the game would be a lot better. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, of course, 🍋 this is very early 🍊 in the Fighting Game 🍋 genre history, 🍊 so you really can't 🍋 blame it for, ya know, 🍊 not being "Street Fighter II" 🍋 or whatever. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We might categorize this game 🍋 as, sort of, a fascinating failure. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Lunar Ball 🇯🇵 // Lunar Pool 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 05 🇯🇵 // 1987 October 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Compile
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 // F.C.I. 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our next game (released 🍋 the same day as "Karateka") 🍋 is "Lunar Ball" 🍊 (or "Lunar Pool", as 🍋 it's known in the U.S.). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And "Lunar Ball" is a 🍋 Pool Simulation Game, 🍊 but it's one 🍋 with a difference. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, here, 🍊 you control, uh, 🍋 which round you start at, 🍊 but also you can 🍋 control the friction. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That is the 🍋 friction of the table, 🍊 which will make 🍋 a [pretty] substantial 🍋 difference in gameplay. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game was 🍋 released by Pony Canyon, 🍊 the same folks who 🍋 released the awful 🍋 "Onyanko Town". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, rather than using 🍊 the same horrible developer 🍋 who did that game, 🍊 they actually used a very 🍋 highly respected developer, 🍊 known as Compile. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Folks who are fans of 🍋 Shoot-'em-Up games 🍊 will probably be familiar 🍋 with the name, Compile. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They developed some 🍋 [of] the most well-beloved 🍊 Shoot-'em-Up titles 🍋 for home consoles, 🍊 especially for 🍋 the MSX computers 🍊 and for the TurboGrafx-16. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They could do quality work, 🍊 and it really shows 🍋 in a game like this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You use your D-Pad [to] move 🍋 that little cursor around. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And that'll, sort of, 🍋 show ya which direction 🍊 you'll be hitting 🍋 the cue ball. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Just like in 🍋 Nintendo's "Golf", 🍊 there's sort of a power meter 🍋 that moves up and down. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 How much force you 🍋 hit the cue ball with 🍊 depends on how fully 🍋 charged the Power Meter is. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game 🍋 starts off simple enough 🍊 but, once ya get 🍋 [into] the higher levels, 🍊 the pool table will start 🍋 getting crazier and crazier. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That and the fact 🍊 that you can control the 🍋 friction of the pool table 🍊 really makes this a 🍋 very unrealistic Pool Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But it's a lot more fun 🍋 because of that. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The name "Lunar Pool", 🍋 I guess, is supposed to imply 🍊 that this is how they 🍋 play pool on the moon. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's one [of] the 🍋 later pool tables. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Part [of] the 🍋 challenge [of] the game 🍊 is tryin' [to] figure 🍋 how [to] get the balls 🍋 [into] the hole 🍊 with these 🍋 crazy-shaped tables. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In Japan, this game was 🍋 released by Pony Canyon, 🍊 but was also released 🍋 in the U.S., as well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Pony Canyon doesn't have 🍋 any sort of U.S. presence, 🍊 so it was released by 🍋 a company called F.C.I.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was, the I -- one [of] the 🍋 first F.C.I. games, I believe. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 F.C.I. is part of Fuj... -- 🍋 Fujisankei Communications Group. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's the same company 🍋 that owns Pony Canyon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 F.C.I. was a company 🍋 set up in 1986 🍊 to distribute Pony Canyon 🍋 games in the U.S. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They're actually still around, 🍊 but they're no longer 🍋 involved with video games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is what the 🍋 game looks like 🍊 with the friction turned 🍋 all the way down. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You're playing on a 🍋 super smooth surface, 🍊 so your ball will go around 🍋 the table forever virtually. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This makes the game a lot 🍋 different, needless [to] say. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Even if you normally 🍊 find Pool Games 🍋 [pretty] boring, like I do, 🍊 this game is actually 🍋 a lot of fun, 🍊 and you really oughta 🍋 give it a try. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It -- It's definitely not 🍋 your typical Pool Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Star Luster 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 06 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In the category of blatant 🍋 rip-offs of old Atari games, 🍊 we have "Star Luster" 🍋 by Namco. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was the 🍋 first Namco game 🍊 [to] be released specifically 🍋 for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, however, 🍋 Namco did release an 🍋 Arcade version of this 🍊 that was basically 🍋 one of those 🍊 'Nintendo Vs.' 🍋 Arcade machines. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 After selecting 🍋 your difficulty level, 🍊 you'll find yourself 🍋 behind the cockpit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you've played 🍋 "Star Raiders", 🍊 you'll know how 🍋 [to] play this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You look on your little 🍋 interplanetary map there 🍊 and find where 🍋 ya wanna warp to. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The 'E's mean enemies, 🍋 the 'B' means base, 🍊 and the little asterixes 🍋 are stars, I assume. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, ya have [to] 🍋 move reasonably fast 🍊 because enemies will 🍋 eventually start 🍊 blowing up 🍋 bases and planets 🍊 if you sit around 🍋 not doing anything. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've reached 🍋 your destination, 🍊 you will, uh, engage in 🍋 some first-person star combat, 🍊 firing off your little lasers, 🍋 trying to avoid enemy fire. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, once you've 🍊 blown up all the 🍋 enemies in this sector, 🍊 ya then move on 🍋 [to] the next one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game does have a few 🍋 little features, there, 🍊 like there's an energy bar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Every time you fire a shot 🍋 or move anywhere, 🍊 you'll use up energy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [If] it gets too low, 🍊 you'll have [to] go [to the] 🍋 nearest base and refuel. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a shield; 🍊 this is sort of like a 🍋 "Halo"-like shield, 🍊 where if ya take a hit, 🍊 your shield will 🍋 go down temporarily. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then you'll need to, uh, 🍋 not be hit for a few seconds 🍊 while it re-energizes itself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You also have a radar, 🍋 computer, and engine status 🍊 on the right-hand side 🍋 of your cockpit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you get hit, 🍋 one of those may go down, 🍊 and you'll need [to] go 🍋 [to] the base for repairs. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While there really is nothing 🍋 original about this game, 🍊 the presentation is 🍋 actually [pretty] good. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Using the sprites to 🍋 create a 3D effect 🍊 is [pretty] effective 🍋 in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The controls 🍋 handle [pretty] well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, as I mentioned, 🍊 this was the first 🍋 game from Namco 🍊 designed specifically 🍋 for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, they have now joined Taito 🍊 in designing games 🍋 for the system, 🍊 rather than just merely 🍋 porting Arcade games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is something 🍋 we'll be ...ginning -- 🍊 starting [to] be seeing, 🍋 uh, more and more of, 🍋 in the near future. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I believe the next big 🍋 [Arcade] game manufacturer 🍋 [to] do this will be Konami. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We've just docked 🍋 with the base, here, 🍊 and this has refueled 🍋 our energy and whatnot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I believe we're playing this 🍋 on the easiest level, 🍊 the so-called training level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The other l... -- levels are 🍋 a bit more difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and you also have some 🍋 kind of photon torpedo thing, 🍊 which we're using now. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you put your cursor on an 🍋 -- a square where an enemy is 🍊 and start firing off 🍋 your torpedo, uh, 🍊 you will blow up 🍋 all the enemies 🍋 on that screen, eventually. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [only] have a limited number. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya see them on, like, 🍋 the little pink squares 🍊 on the left-hand side, there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} not a bad game, 🍊 even though there's 🍋 nothing original about it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Even one of the emen... -- enemies 🍊 look exactly like the 🍋 Death Star from 'Star Wars', 🍊 as you may have noticed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One funny little thing, 🍊 when the game is over, 🍋 it'll give you your ranking, 🍊 which is usually some 🍋 ridiculous little n... -- name. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like, in this case, 🍋 I am, uh, Cadet Mitochondria, 🍊 meaning I didn't 🍋 really do that well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} certainly, 🍋 worth checking out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, it even has a nice little, 🍋 'The galaxy is destroyed.', 🍋 screen when ya lose. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Volguard II 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 07 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by dB-Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by dB-Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Hey, you guys remember 🍋 "Formation Z", 🍊 the horrible 🍋 Horizontal Shooter? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's back, and now 🍋 it's called "Volguard II". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though "Volguard II" is 🍋 actually really not that bad. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's actually quite a bit 🍋 better than "Formation Z", 🍊 but it's kind of similar in 🍋 that it's a Horizontal Shooter, 🍊 in which you can, sort of, 🍋 change into some sort of robot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That was apparently 🍊 quite a popular theme 🍋 in Japan, at this time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is from dB-SOFT, 🍊 the same company 🍋 that gave us "Flappy". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it's actually really 🍋 not that bad of a Shooter. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [pretty] frantic, 🍋 as you can see. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So frantic, in fact, 🍋 that they don't give you, uh, 🍊 a system where 🍋 one hit kills you; 🍊 you actually have a life meter 🍋 or a damage meter of some sort. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the upper right-hand corner, 🍋 currently, it says 02, 🍊 that's how much 🍋 damage you've taken; 🍊 when it gets [to] 99, 🍋 then you die. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, it sort of 🍋 slowly builds up over 🍋 the course [of] the game, 🍊 and you can actually take 🍋 quite a bit of damage 🍋 if you're not careful. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Volguard (I)" 🍋 was never actually 🍋 released for the FamiCom; 🍊 it was actually a game that 🍋 came out for MSX computers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And while ya might think 🍊 this game looks 🍋 [pretty] primitive, 🍊 it actually sorta 🍋 has some features 🍊 of more advanced 🍋 Shooters, at the time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 ya can get power-ups; 🍊 like, here you have 🍋 a second little ship 🍊 that allows you 🍋 Double Shot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These kinda things 🍋 were actually not 🍋 really common in 1985. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And there're even bosses 🍋 at the end of each level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 here comes one now. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have [to] blow up each 🍋 individual gun turret, 🍊 then you can blow up 🍋 the actual, uh, city, 🍊 at the top there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} does put quite a few 🍋 bullets on the screen 🍋 at one time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When it comes 🍋 right down to it, 🍊 this game is 🍋 actually [pretty] hard. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can select the level 🍋 that ya wanna play in. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Level 4 is the 🍋 most difficult; 🍊 in fact, it's 🍋 virtually impossible. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, if nothing else, 🍋 {it's} a challenging game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, 🍊 ya can change [into] some sort 🍋 of robot / mech-type creature. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But it's really 🍋 not that useful, 🍊 as all it really does 🍋 is [sort of] give you, 🍊 [sort of], like, a 🍋 larger vertical profile, 🍊 and ya get hit more. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya see the mech, right here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} nice thing is 🍋 you can run along the ground; 🍊 you can destroy the little 🍋 cr... -- uh, bases, at -- 🍊 down at the bottom, easier. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [have to] use your Bombs 🍋 [to] destroy them, otherwise. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, {it's} not really 🍋 a bad Shooter 🍊 (especially compared [to] 🍋 stuff like "Formation Z"), 🍊 but [there'll] be 🍋 better things coming out 🍋 [on] the FamiCom later. 🍇🍌

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 07 🇯🇵 // 1987 September 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Micro Graphic Image
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 // Brøderbund 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now we come [to] the -- 🍊 one [of] the most hated 🍋 N.E.S. games of all time, 🍋 "Spelunker". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In Japan, this was 🍋 released by Irem. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If this music sounds awesome, 🍋 it's because it's from 🍊 Mussorgsky's 🍋 "Pictures at an Exhibition". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The actual original in-game 🍋 music is really not that great. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And I think we've just 🍋 seen part [of] the reason 🍊 why this game is 🍋 hated [so] much - 🍊 because you die an 🍋 awful lot, in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is a port of a 🍋 1983 American computer game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I believe it was originally 🍋 developed for Atari computers, 🍊 ported [onto] many, many systems, 🍊 including this 🍋 Nintendo version, 🍊 which was perhaps actually 🍋 developed by Irem, themselves. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If so, shame on them, 🍊 because this is a 🍋 terrible, terrible port. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I think a lot of this 🍋 has [to] do with the controls. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They're very stiff - 🍋 very unresponsive. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But, as people have pointed out, 🍊 your character can fall 🍋 a very, very small distance 🍋 before dying. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, if your character 🍋 was a real person, 🍊 this [would] be like a 🍋 two-foot drop killing you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] a shame because this 🍋 version [of] "Spelunker", 🍊 I mean, looks very good! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It looks {a} lot better than 🍋 the computer versions! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But it's just so unplayable, 🍋 because [of] the controls. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When I tried playing it, 🍋 I mean, I just die 🍊 over and over 🍋 and over again. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Any little tiny thing 🍋 kills you, and it -- it's, 🍊 I mean, a -- just a 🍋 very poorly ported game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [So], this one we're 🍋 gonna [have to] say, 🍋 'Definitely skip it.'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it certainly has 🍋 earned its reputation 🍊 as one of the lesser 🍋 games for [the] FamiCom. 🍇🍌

👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, for all you fans 🍋 of "Formation Z" 🍋 and "Volguard II", 🍊 we have 🍋 "Choujikuu Yousai Macross". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is yet another 🍋 Horizontal Shooter, 🍊 in which your fighter 🍋 can transform into a robot. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game was developed 🍋 by Namco, and it was, 🍊 sort of, published, in 🍋 conjunction with Bandai 🍊 (who I assume owned 🍋 the rights to the -- 🍊 the TV series 🍋 this was based on). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly enough, the name 🍋 on the video game box 🍊 actually says 'Namco', 🍋 rather than the usual 'Namcot'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 'Macross' was a very popular 🍋 Japanese animated series 🍋 in the 1980s. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., 🍋 we know it as 'Robotech'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Basically, it concerns 🍋 humanity battling 🍊 a race of evil aliens 🍋 or *something* like that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For this game, 🍊 this translates [into] 🍋 flying [to] the right 🍊 and blowing up every 🍋 spaceship that comes your way. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is actually very 🍋 similar [to] "Volguard II". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can change shape. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The robot shape is, uh, 🍋 horiz... -- vertically larger, 🍊 so ya have a li... -- more 🍋 likelihood of getting hit, 🍋 but it's more powerful. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Basically, you 🍋 fly through space, 🍊 enter some sort 🍋 of space station, 🍊 and then blow up 🍋 a little boss, at the end. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then, the game repeats 🍋 over and over and over again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The levels are 🍋 actually [pretty] short. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game looks better 🍋 than "Volguard...", 🍊 but I don't know that it 🍋 really plays any better. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In some ways, it's 🍋 actually even, uh, 🍊 more simplified 🍋 than "Volguard...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There really ap... -- 🍋 aren't any, like, 🍊 power-ups or 🍋 anything like that. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, ya get, like, 🍋 a bonus point or a bonus life 🍊 or something that will 🍋 re...uh...fuel your Power Bar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can take quite a few hits, 🍋 just like in "Volguard II". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I personally find the space 🍋 scene [to] be rather distracting. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 All those little orange 🍋 explosions in the background 🍊 make it kind of hard 🍋 [to] see the enemies' fire 🍋 when you're playing it, 🍊 so I don't really 🍋 like this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it is 🍋 incredibly repetitive. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I find it [to] be a little 🍋 bit on the difficult side. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, as far as Shooters go, 🍊 this is, uh, [pretty] 🍋 typical of a mediocre 🍋 Shooter of this era. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 1942 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 11 🇯🇵 // 1986 November 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Micronics
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, here's a bit of a 🍋 switch up on the Shooter 🍋 scene for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a port of 🍋 Capcom's classic, "1942". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing about this game 🍋 is this is, in some ways, 🍊 maybe the first port of, like, 🍋 a modern classic Arcade game 🍋 to the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most of the other ports were 🍋 either much older classics 🍊 (like, ya know, "Pac-Man" 🍋 or "Donkey Kong" or 🍋 "BurgerTime" or whatever) 🍊 or they were ports 🍋 of more recent but 🍋 much-lesser-known games 🍊 (such as "Ikki", which we 🍋 saw earlier in this episode). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also of note, 🍋 this was the first, uh, 🍋 Capcom game for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Capcom was one of 🍋 a newer generation 🍊 of video game Arcade, 🍋 uh, game developers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [They've] been around since 1979 🍊 and were originally known 🍋 as, uh, Capsule Computers 🍊 or something 🍋 along those lines. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's where the name 🍋 'Capcom' comes from. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Their first game 🍋 came out in 1984. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this game (which was 🍋 originally in Arcades in 1984) 🍊 was their first major hit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Capcom would eventually 🍋 go on [to] overshadow 🍊 a lot [of] the older 🍋 companies, like Namco, 🍊 and had many huge hits, 🍊 both for -- in Arcades 🍋 (like "Street Fighter II") 🍊 as well as in the consoles 🍋 (ya know, games like 🍊 "Resident Evil" and 🍋 "Devil May Cry"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They're obviously, 🍋 uh, still around 🍊 and still making 🍋 some [pretty] good games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And "1942" (the Arcade game) 🍊 really injected 🍋 a lot of new life 🍊 into the Shooter genre. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} added a lot of things 🍋 like, for example, uh, 🍊 the power-ups you can get 🍋 gives you extra shots, 🍊 wingmen that'll come 🍋 and attach themselves 🍋 [to] the side [of] your plane 🍊 and, uh, also give ya 🍋 more firepower, 🍊 being able to, uh, 🍋 explode all the enemies 🍋 on the screen at one time 🍊 by (again) getting 🍋 a certain power-up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's, uh, bosses, 🍋 every few levels. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Really, this game was [pretty] 🍋 influential on later Shooters. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's a real classic 🍋 and a lot of fun. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Unfortunately, 🍋 this FamiCom port 🍊 is definitely not 🍋 as good as it *could* be. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was not ported by 🍋 of Capcom, themselves, 🍋 unfortunately, 🍊 but rather by 🍋 a rather infamous company, 🍋 known as Micronics. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Micronics is a lot like Tose. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They're one [of] those 🍋 shadowy phantom developers 🍊 that other companies 🍋 use anonymously 🍋 [to] develop games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And their games are generally 🍋 noted as being [pretty] bad. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... This game has 🍋 a [pretty] bad frame rate, 🍊 and is kind of, uh, jerky 🍊 and n... -- not at all 🍋 smooth playing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, uh, 🍋 Micronics' bad conversion 🍊 can't completely 🍋 ruin the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's actually still 🍋 quite a bit of fun [to] play. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But overall, it's, uh, 🍋 quite a disappointment really, 🍊 compared, especially 🍋 to the Arcade game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We're coming up to, 🍋 uh, the first boss, 🍋 right here; 🍊 he's actually, uh, 🍋 quite difficult. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this is probably 🍋 one [of] the better Shooters 🍊 for the FamiCom so far, 🍋 but certainly not as good 🍋 as it could be. 🍇🍌

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 11 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Synapse
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As I've mentioned, 🍋 we're covering some rather 🍋 notorious games this episode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Spelunker" is considered 🍋 [to] be -- by some, 🍊 [to] be one of the 🍋 worst N.E.S. games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, my vote for 🍋 worst game this episode 🍋 actually goes to 🍊 a much lesser-known game, 🍋 called "Dough Boy". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And this game was 🍋 published by Kemco. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They are noted as being a 🍋 manufacturer / publisher 🍊 of N.E.S. games 🍋 that aren't very good. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And they're actually 🍋 still around; 🍊 they've developed for 🍋 a lot of systems, 🍊 but most [of] their games 🍋 are [pretty] mediocre. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, um, some [of] them 🍋 are downright awful, 🍋 like this one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As far as I can tell, 🍋 you're -- 🍊 {the} plot of this game is 🍋 you're some sort of soldier, 🍊 tryin' [to] get [to the end of] 🍋 the battlefield or something. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You're the little 🍋 guy in green, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You have a gun 🍋 but, oddly enough, 🍊 it's easier [to] 🍋 kill your opponents 🍊 simply by 🍋 walking [into] them! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, these little things, here 🍊 (there's, like, 🍋 things you pick up 🍊 like mines and T.N.T., 🍋 and so on, so forth) 🍊 you can hide in 🍋 [the] little trenches. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I... -- It's kind of hard to explain 🍊 exactly how bad this game is 🍋 by looking at the video. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, i... -- 🍋 it controls horribly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The graphics are 🍋 *incredibly* ugly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The scrolling is [pretty] choppy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, really, ah, I have 🍋 nothing at all nice 🍋 [to] say about this game; 🍊 it's [pretty] unplayable. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You certainly won't have 🍋 a good time playing it; 🍋 that's for sure. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [To] give you an idea of some 🍋 [of] the gameplay issues, 🍊 in the 2nd Level, here, 🍋 you have [to] use dynamite 🍊 to blow up those 🍋 little, uh, radar things, 🍊 in order [to] cross the rivers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yes, the -- the blue part 🍋 is supposed {to} be water. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, you actually use 🍋 the same button to 🍊 switch between items 🍋 in your inventory, 🍊 to shoot your gun, 🍋 and to set off T.N.T.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This makes it rather 🍋 difficult [to] set off T.N.T., 🍊 and actually, 🍋 I never mastered the 🍋 art of setting off T.N.T.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I would always blow 🍋 myself up whenever I tried, 🍊 as we'll see in a moment, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But it seems, uh, 🍋 very, very tricky 🍊 [to] actually 🍋 play this right. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And I really didn't have 🍋 the patience [to] get past 🍋 the 2nd Level, 🍊 and, quite frankly, 🍋 probably neither will you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Because this game is 🍋 really an enormous mess 🍊 and fails in 🍋 every single category. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Spelunker" has nice graphics, 🍊 "Bokosuka Wars" has 🍋 innovative and unique gameplay, 🍊 but this game 🍋 really has nothing. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Zunou Senkan Galg 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 14 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by dB-Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by dB-Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This next game is "Galg" 🍋 or "Zunou Senkan Galg", 🍊 which means something 🍋 along the lines of 🍋 'Brain Battleship Galg'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This name is given 🍋 on the box art. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Released by dB-SOFT, 🍊 presumably developed 🍋 by these, uh, 🍋 Team Bioteckers people. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This appears {to} be 🍊 a rather simple-looking 🍋 Vertical Shooter, 🍊 but, according to the box, 🍋 it's actually an R.P.G. - 🍊 or rather an R.P.G. Shooter. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the best way 🍋 I can describe this game 🍊 is "Tower of Druaga" 🍋 as a Shooter. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The object is to 🍋 collect 100 parts; 🍊 here's one now 🍋 (that little triangular thing). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've got all 100, 🍋 you go to face the boss, 🍊 whose name is Dragg. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's about 🍋 one part per level, 🍊 so the game is quite long 🍋 (and quite repetitive!). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, just like 🍋 "Tower of Druaga", 🍊 apparently this game 🍋 is much more 🍋 complicated and involved 🍊 than it appears [to] be, 🍋 on the surface. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As it turns out, 🍋 there are numerous 🍋 hidden things - 🍊 various sorts of 🍋 power-ups and objects, 🍊 and all kinds of crazy 🍋 things that you can find 🍊 but which you 🍋 might not encounter 🍋 during normal gameplay. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's various events 🍋 you have [to] do 🍊 that'll actually trigger 🍋 these things to appear. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, while this game is 🍋 virtually unknown in the West, 🍊 in Japan, apparently 🍋 it's considered {to} be 🍋 a major breakthrough title. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Incredibly, there's even a 🍋 s... -- even a game guide, 🍊 written and published 🍋 about this in Japan, 🍊 explaining how [to] find all 🍋 the hidden secret things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you were [to] sit down 🍋 [to] play it, though, 🍊 it will mostly 🍋 seem [to] be, sort of, like, 🍊 an average typical 🍋 Shooter of the day 🍊 (in fact, a rather 🍋 repetitious one). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I played through, 🍋 I think, about Level 11, 🍊 and, uh, the game doesn't 🍋 really change that much. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One interesting thing is 🍋 at the end of each level, 🍊 [there'll] be, like, 🍋 a little split, 🍊 and you can decide which 🍋 path you wanna go down. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, if you 🍋 actually wanna try [to] 🍊 get the most out [of] this game 🍋 and find all the hidden things, 🍊 well, good luck! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... I don't believe 🍋 that there's ever been 🍊 an English language 🍋 FAQ or walkthrough, 🍊 uh, written for this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, the game 🍋 is really not at all 🍋 well-known in the West. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I couldn't really 🍋 find out that much 🍋 information about it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's really not 🍋 that hard [to] play. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, I blow 🍋 myself up quite a bit 🍊 in this li... -- little, uh, 🍋 video I've made, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But in reality, 🍋 when you're playing, 🍊 you'll find it more, kind of, 🍋 boring and a test of patience 🍊 rather than actually difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] hard to imagine anyone 🍋 wanting [to] play through, 🍋 like, all 100 levels 🍊 and get 100 parts 🍋 to finish the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Still, the idea of a Shooter 🍋 with R.P.G. elements built-in 🍋 is rather intriguing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully, someday, 🍋 someone [with] more patience 🍊 will explore this game 🍋 in a bit more detail 🍊 and find out 🍋 more about it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Bokosuka Wars 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 14 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bits Laboratory
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now we come to a game that is 🍋 also sometimes described as 🍊 one [of] the worst games 🍋 for [the] FamiCom ever made, 🍊 "Bokosuka Wars". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, rather than saying 🍋 this game is bad, 🍊 I'm just gonna say it's 🍋 slightly misunderstood. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's actually a very 🍋 original unique game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There is really nothing 🍋 like it, before or since. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is actually a port 🍋 of a game by ASCII, 🍊 originally designed 🍋 for the MSX. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this game, 🍋 you play King Suren. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The object is to march 🍋 600 meters [to the] left 🍋 [to] battle Ogereth, 🍊 which [is] some sort 🍋 of evil wizard 🍊 {who} just turned a lot 🍋 of your men into trees 🍊 and [imprisoned] the rest. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Throughout the game, 🍋 you'll bump [into] 🍋 the trees and rocks, 🍊 and if one of your comrades 🍋 is imprisoned within, 🍊 he'll appear 🍋 after you bump it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's then added [to] your army. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In theory, 🍋 the game is very simple; 🍊 you move your character 🍋 across the screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you happen [to] 🍋 run into an opponent, 🍊 a battle will ensue, 🍋 and the [loser] dies. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, the method 🍋 of moving your units 🍋 is quite strange. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] select which kind 🍋 of unit you want [to] move 🍊 (either the King, 🍋 the Knights, 🍋 or the Pawns) 🍊 or you can move 🍋 them all together. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, unless the 🍋 King is selected, 🍊 the entire group 🍋 will move together. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 if you select your Pawns 🍊 and you hit up 🍋 [on] the D-Pad, 🍊 all of the Pawns will 🍋 move one space up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You actually [can't] 🍋 move them separately. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This can make navigating 🍋 [pretty] tricky, 🍊 and it's quite easy [to] 🍋 get one of your characters 🍊 to accidentally 🍋 run into an enemy 🍊 or get stuck 🍋 behind something. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing that might 🍋 confuse people about this game 🍊 and make it more difficult 🍋 than it really is, 🍊 is it superficially 🍋 resembles an Action R.P.G.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, when your 🍋 units battle [an] enemy, 🍊 if they win, 🍋 they'll come out 🍋 a little bit stronger. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Therefore, ya might think 🍊 [that] you should battle 🍋 as many enemies as you can 🍊 and get your units 🍋 stronger and stronger. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, this is 🍋 definitely *not* a good idea. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can [only] Level Up 🍋 your units so far. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I believe that 🍋 winning three battles 🍊 with the Knights, 🍋 for example, 🍊 will level [him] up 🍋 to a Gold Knight, 🍊 and then he doesn't 🍋 get any stronger! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once a unit dies, 🍊 there's no way 🍋 of reviving them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You, of course, 🍋 always pick up more units, 🍋 throughout the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, here 🍋 we found some that were 🍋 being held in prison. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Use your Knight [to] break 🍋 through the walls, 🍊 and then ya can 🍋 get the guys out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But really, 🍋 your main strategy 🍋 in this game 🍊 should try [to] be 🍋 to avoid all fights, 🍋 if at all possible. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Really, what you'll 🍋 be using your Pawns 🍋 and your Knights for 🍊 is more or less [just], 🍋 sort of, cannon fodder 🍊 tryin' [to] get the 🍋 King across the screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Because if the 🍋 King gets killed, 🍋 the game is over 🍊 and you have [to] start over 🍋 from [the] beginning, 🍊 it's best to try to 🍋 avoid using the King 🍋 in any battles at all, 🍊 even though 🍋 he's the strongest. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here we've just uncovered 🍋 some sort of, uh, magician 🍊 surrounded by, uh, 🍋 some sort of ghost. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you kill the magician first, 🍋 the ghost will disappear. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You actually have [to] walk 🍋 your King past {the} magician, 🍊 {in} order [to] get him to, uh -- 🍋 the walls [to] disappear. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, there certainly are 🍋 a lot [of] spots where 🍊 you actually cannot 🍋 avoid battles at all. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, right here 🍋 you basically face 🍊 a solid wall of 🍋 enemy Golden Knights. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, in order [to] get through them, 🍊 you're gonna have 🍋 [to do] some battles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, as you [can] see, 🍊 I am having [to] use my King 🍋 to, uh, do some fighting. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But really, 🍋 this needs [to] be kept 🍋 at an absolute minimum. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 More [than] anything else, 🍊 this is basically 🍋 a Strategy Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The object is -- is to 🍋 figure out how [to] move 🍊 your pieces across the board 🍋 with {a} minimum of fighting. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you do risk a lot of battles 🍋 and your King does get killed, 🍊 you will probably 🍋 eventually get 🍊 the infamous, 🍋 'WOW! YOU LOSE!' screen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, folks who 🍋 rush off [into] battle 🍋 with their King 🍊 (figuring, 'He's 🍋 the strongest unit.') 🍊 will probably see 🍋 this screen quite a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is because the battles 🍋 seem [to] be determined 🍊 not [only] just by 🍋 your characters' strength 🍊 but by a good amount 🍋 of luck as well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [While], of course, 🍋 luck is normally used 🍋 in, ya know, R.P.G.s, 🍊 in this game, there seems 🍋 {to} be about a 1 in 4 chance 🍊 that a character will 🍋 lose a battle 🍊 (even against a much 🍋 weaker character). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And here is the famous, 🍋 'WOW! YOU LOSE!' screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You get a similar 🍋 screen, if ya win. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, if ya do actually 🍋 have the time and patience 🍊 [to] make your way all 🍋 the way through this game 🍊 (and it is -- can be a bit -- 🍋 little bit on the long side, 🍊 especially if you're 🍋 constantly having [to] restart) 🍊 you will finally 🍋 come to King Ogereth. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, again, winning the game 🍋 is strictly a matter 🍋 of pure luck. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 All you [can] really do 🍋 is just keep throwing 🍋 your characters [into] him 🍊 until finally you 🍋 just happen [to] win. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this case, when I 🍋 actually use Suren to, uh, 🍋 battle Ogereth, 🍊 I do win, but the odds 🍋 are just as well, uh, 🍊 I could have lost as well 🍋 and had [to] start 🍋 the whole game over. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [So], ya can certainly see 🍋 why this game can be 🍋 extremely frustrating. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The fact that you 🍋 can come so far, 🍊 spend so much time 🍋 playing it, 🍊 and basically lose the game 🍋 on the roll of a die 🍊 does seem rather 🍋 unfair and frustrating. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And really, 🍋 if you play this game, 🍊 you'll probably get [to] 🍋 hate it [pretty] quickly, 🍊 simply by the way it 🍋 just keeps killin' you 🍊 over and over 🍋 and over again. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, 🍋 once ya win, 🍋 it starts over. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, my opinion on 🍋 "Bokosuka Wars" 🍊 is not that it's 🍋 a terrible game, 🍊 but rather it is a 🍋 difficult, unfair, 🍋 frustrating game 🍊 but also a game 🍋 that's rather unusual, 🍊 relatively well-designed, 🍋 and rather unique. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's definitely 🍋 worth trying. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, I 🍋 certainly can't say 🍊 that everyone'll 🍋 actually have the 🍋 patience [to] finish it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you know how [to] 🍋 play the game, however, 🍊 and have some basic strategy, 🍊 it is actually possible 🍋 [to] get through it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Obake no Q-Tarou: Wan Wan Panic 🇯🇵 // "Chubby Cherub" 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 16 🇯🇵 // 1986 October 29 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is known in Japan as 🍋 "Obake no Q-Tarou: 🍋 Wan Wan Panic". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I believe that 'wan wan' 🍋 is the [noise] that, uh, 🍊 dogs make when barking, 🍋 in Japanese. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 That's a [pretty] good little 🍋 bit of theme music, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is, once again, 🍋 from Bandai 🍊 and, once again, probably 🍋 developed by the mysterious 🍊 phantom developer, 🍋 known as Tose. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is based on a 🍋 '60s manga and anime series, 🍋 'Q-Tarou', 🍊 'bout a mischievous ghost 🍋 that moves in with a family, 🍊 and it has a dog phobia. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We'd probably 🍋 categorize this game 🍊 as a side-scrolling 🍋 Platformer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya need to 🍋 run, jump, or fly 🍊 over the various obstacles, 🍊 avoiding the dogs 🍋 and their bark attacks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You also have a steadily 🍋 diminishing Power Bar; 🍊 ya [need to] eat the 🍋 various fruit and candy, 🍋 in order to survive. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, you can fly, 🍊 though this uses up 🍋 quite a bit of energy, 🍊 and once your Energy Bar gets 🍋 to about the halfway point, 🍊 you will lose the ability [to] 🍋 fly until you refuel again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You also have the ability 🍋 [to] shoot out some little, 🍋 sort of, Gau burst. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the range 🍋 is very, very short, 🍊 so it's actually really 🍋 not of much use. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game doesn't 🍋 really look that hard 🍊 (especially if you're flying), 🍋 but further [into] the game, 🍊 the food gets much, 🍋 much more scarce, 🍊 and you have {to} do 🍋 a lot of platforming, 🍊 rather than just flying 🍋 over all the enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Every three screens or so -- 🍊 Every three levels or so, 🍋 you come [across] a boss. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I think the object 🍋 of this game is [to] 🍊 find the various missing 🍋 children in the neighborhood. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This guy looks like 🍊 he's some kind of 🍋 bank robber or something. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps he's 🍋 kidnapped the kids; 🍊 I'm not really sure. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, in the U.S., of course, 🍋 this particular anime 🍋 was not at all well-known. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the game was reworked 🍋 as "Chubby Cherub". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Graphically, very little 🍋 has been changed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, your character 🍋 is now a little naked cherub 🍊 with a rather grotesque 🍋 jaw that opens up 🍊 when he eats things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A few of the icons 🍋 have been changed, 🍊 all the Japanese text 🍋 has been removed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. version is easier 🍊 because your Power Bar goes 🍋 down at a much slower rate. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This enables you to spend 🍋 a lot more time flying, 🍊 as opposed to 🍋 running and jumping. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game has a 🍋 somewhat bad reputation; 🍊 Internet semi-celebrity, 🍋 Seanbaby, 🍊 put it on his list of 🍋 all-time worst N.E.S. Games, 🍊 but it's really not that bad. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's hardly a 🍋 masterpiece {of} the genre. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It is interesting that 🍋 this game came out 🍊 [only] two months after 🍋 "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Thus, this game is 🍋 actually the second 🍋 side-scrolling Platformer 🍊 actually designed 🍋 for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} certainly worth 🍋 taking a look at this game, 🍊 even if the Chubby Cherub 🍋 character design 🍋 is a little ugly. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Something rather unusual 🍊 is this rather 🍋 grotesque stereotype 🍋 that appears in the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I assume this was something 🍋 in the Japanese version 🍋 that was never changed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 All in all, however, 🍋 this is [pretty] good 🍋 for a Tose game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's definitely not 🍋 the disaster that 🍋 was "Kinnikuman...". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Thexder 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 19 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bits Laboratory
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Square 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our last game this 🍋 episode is "Thexder". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game came out 🍋 on December 19th, 1985, 🍊 and [the] 'Macross' game 🍋 had come out on December 10th. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In other words, it'd 🍋 been [a] whole nine days 🍊 since Japanese consumers had 🍋 a game about a jet plane 🍋 that can turn into a robot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, this game existed 🍋 [to] help fill that gap! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], you're probably thinking, 🍊🍓 'Aw, man! Not another 🍋 one [of] these things! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 How many [of] these 🍋 things do we *need*?'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, this is not actually 🍋 quite the same as 🍋 those other games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is not *really* 🍋 a Horizontal *Shooter*, 🍊 even though it certainly *looks* 🍋 like it, when you turn it on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you might be tempted 🍋 to play it like a Shooter; 🍊 however, that will probably 🍋 get you killed [pretty] quickly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is almost more of 🍋 a Platform-style, uh, 🍋 Run-'n'-Gun game, 🍊 along the lines of 🍊 (oh, I don't know, {it} kind of 🍋 looks a little bit like) 🍊 "Metroid" or 🍋 something like that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's not really a Platformer, 🍋 it's not a Shooter, {and} 🍋 [it's] not a Run-'n'-Gun; 🍊 it's some kind of weird 🍋 combination of all of these. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, something 🍋 I should tell you 🍊 is that this game 🍋 has a [pretty] big fan base 🍊 here in the United States. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was originally released 🍋 for Japanese computers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was ported to the FamiCom 🍋 (of all people) by SquareSoft. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is actually the first 🍋 game published by SquareSoft, 🍊 uh, for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The game was later ported 🍋 to American computers 🍊 such as the Apple 🍋 and the Commodore. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it became, 🍋 uh, quite popular 🍊 and is [considered] {to} be, 🍋 sort of, a classic of, uh, 🍊 early games on, ya know, 🍋 American, uh, Computers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, I personally think 🍊 the game is 🍋 really, really terrible. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In theory, this game 🍋 sounds [pretty] cool. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You control this robot 🍋 who has [to] sort of 🍊 fly, run, jump, 🍋 and shoot his way 🍊 through all these giant 🍋 "Metroid"-style levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It seems kind of 🍋 ahead of its time! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This [is] certainly 🍋 a lot more, uh, 🍊 interesting-looking, 🍋 I suppose, than, uh, 🍊 all the other, sorta, 🍋 bad Shooters 🍊 we've been looking at. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But I really have a hard 🍋 time playing this game! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe it has something [to] 🍋 do with the controls. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, this little, uh, 🍋 when you're in a, 🍋 uh, the Jet form, 🍊 if you, uh -- the Jet 🍋 r... -- runs up against a wall, 🍊 it'll transform 🍋 [into] the Robot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {That} makes it 🍋 kind of difficult 🍊 [to] navigate these 🍋 narrow passages. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Likewise, if you're the robot 🍊 and you accidentally 🍋 press Down on your D-Pad, 🍊 you'll transform [into] the Jet. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I often find [myself] 🍋 transforming from one form 🍋 [to] the other [accidentally]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, I find this game [to] be 🍋 a little on the hard side. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe I'm somehow not in 🍋 the mo... -- wrong, uh -- 🍊 the right mindset 🍋 for playing it; 🍊 I'm trying [to] play it like it 🍋 was a different kind of game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike a Shooter, 🍋 for example, uh, 🍊 these enemies don't 🍋 die in one hit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have [to] hit 'em 🍋 a whole bunch [of] times! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 That might not be so bad, 🍋 but your weapon has some 🍋 sort of auto lock-on feature, 🍊 where it'll, sort of, 🍋 shoot bullets in all directions 🍊 at any enemies on the screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can't just shoot 🍋 the enemy that's coming 🍋 directly towards you; 🍊 it'll shoot one 🍋 bullet and then, uh, 🍊 shoot bullets up and down, 🍋 {and} so on, so forth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have [to] do a lot of 🍊 shooting and backing up, 🍋 shooting and backing up. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I've certainly tried 🍋 my hand at playing this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm not very good at it; 🍋 I really couldn't get very far. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, [to] me, this game 🍋 seems like a huge mess 🍋 and a huge nightmare 🍊 and almost 🍋 completely unplayable. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, 🍊 apparently it has its fans, 🍋 so don't let that stop you! 🍇🍌
