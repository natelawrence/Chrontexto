👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chronturbo Episode 3 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Hey everybody*, it's the new episode of '*Chronturbo*'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'll] keep this [short and] *sweet*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *We've* [got] <sixteen::16> *games* [from the first quarter] of <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Nine*::[*1989*]>. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*astute*] among you [will notice] a *few minor* aesthetic *changes* going on this *episode*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [will continue to] see *other* small changes [in] '*Chrontendo*' [and] the *other series* in the near *future*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, [note that about] half {of} the *games {in} this episode* are from publishers *new* [to] the P.C. *Engine*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, <third::3rd>-[party support] is emerging in a *big way* for the console. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Vigilante 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 January 14 🇯🇵 // 1989 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: IREM 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Irem 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *God!* That music is *so funky*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The first P.C. Engine *game* of <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Nine*::[*1989]>: "Vigilante*"! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 'The *skinheads* have taken Madonna *hostage*.' - a line that *Sega's* "Vigilante" for the *Master* System *completely* screwed up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, we saw that version in "Chronsega ... <Six::6>". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was a *terrible* port [and] very [frustrating to] *play*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *P.C. Engine* version, on the other *hand*, is [*pretty] darn faithful* to the Arcade *original*, though some [of] the shops get the tops of their *signs* cut off. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here's* the original Arcade game from <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Eight*::1988>. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *sprites* are [*pretty*] darn *similar* [in] *size* [and] *appearance* to the *P.C. Engine* ones. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *the game is* [pretty] simple. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya just] punch [and] kick *everyone* who gets [in] the way [of] your [constant rightward] *motion*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Vigilante*" is *basically* in the style of Irem's earlier "Kung *Fu* Master" (a.k.a. "Spartan *X*"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Enemies [tend to] *rush* [at] *you* [from both] *sides*, [and] you *often* need [to] rapidly turn *around* [and *alternately* attack] groups of *enemies* from both the left [and the] *right*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Occasionally*, you [can] find a *weapon*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [there's only] *one* here (nunchucks). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*And then* there's, like], special [enemies that will appear and] take a few extra *hits* or [use a] more powerful *attack*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like *this* guy! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He *shoots* [at] you, which [will] drain a huge chunk [of your] *Life* Bar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So], you [should actually just] duck and walk *away* from [him]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The *first] boss* is [*just*] some *random, fat, bearded dude*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is back when big beards [might indicate] a *tough* guy [rather than] a [sensitive] folky hipster. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [if ya *still have*] the *nunchucks*, this guy goes down *real easy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just] *corner* him [and hit him] over [and] over [and] over [again in] the [*gut*] 'til [he] *expires*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [If ya, *sorta], press* [him] against the *van*, you'll [get] a *quicker kill*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *now poor* Madonna [is] being [taken] to... the *junkyard*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Do all these* [Beat-'em]-Ups ever explain *why* these *guys* [are] kidnapping [your] *girlfriend*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, *why would* they kidnap the [girlfriend of] the [toughest] guy [in] *town*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's like] asking [for] *trouble*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Of] course, *maybe* they're going after [your girlfriend to prevent] you [from] breaking up their criminal *enterprises*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If *so, these gangs* are *terrible bluffers*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They *never harm* [your] *girlfriend, even after* you've *gone* on a gang-member-beating-up *rampage*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya think they would, like, *send you* a *finger* [in the] *mail* or something [to let you] know they're *serious*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Level <Three::3>* starts [getting] *trickier*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [These] guys on [*motorcycles*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya need to perform] a *jumping kick*, [which *doesn't] always* seem [to] work. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still*, there's some nice [parallax] *scrolling* on [*display*], here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Though this *bridge* you're *crossing* seems [geographically *impossible*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya *see* [Manhattan in the] *background*, [including] the *Twin Towers*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Is [*this* the] Verrazano *Narrows Bridge*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Are [ya] *headed [out]* of [Staten] *Island*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The *boss* is a lot] tougher [than the *other*] two, as ya [*can't* just] *spam* [him with] *one [attack]* over [and] *over* again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Vigilante"'s* a [pretty short] *game* - [only] five *levels* (and *this* [is] Level *<Four::4>*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As [an *Arcade*] conversion, [it's *pretty*] good (I mean, [not], like, "R-*Type" good*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] "Vigilante" feels old-fashioned, compared [to] the wave of post-"Double *Dragon*" [Beat-'em]-Ups coming *out*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *still*, the overall [*result*] is [pretty decent]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 SonSon II 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 January 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Capcom 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: NEC Avenue 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Much [better* than] "*Vigilante*" is the [*second*] game from <[Nineteen-Eighty]-*Nine*::[*1989*]>. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And this] nice [little] *title* sequence both sets [up] the *story* (well, what story there actually *is*) [and] *also* manages to keep the final boss' *appearance* a *secret*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, I [*wasn't* exactly] too [excited about] the idea [of] a "SonSon *<Two::II>"*, considering the [*first*] game was [pretty] *subpar*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*It was* originally an] *Arcade* game [in <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Four*::*1984*>]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It was] Capcom's [*attempt*] to [create] a *ground-based* [Horizontal *Shoot*-'em]-Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya know], we *sometimes* see [ground]-based [*Vertical* Shoot-'em]-Ups, but *horizontal* ones [are quite] *rare*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *FamiCom* "SonSon", [ported] by *Micronics*, appeared in "Chrontendo ... *<Seven::7>*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was a *horrible* mess. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] "SonSon *<Two::II>*", [an *original] game* [for] the P.C. *Engine, turns out to be* [quite] a nice [*surprise*]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a well-[crafted *Platformer], which [reminds] me* a [*lot*] of "Wonder Boy [in *Monster*] Land". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] run [around] *killing enemies* [and] *picking up the* money that they *drop*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 '*Zennies*' is [the] name [of the] *currency*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [encounter] these shops here [*and*] there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*SonSon <Two::II*>" does [have] a *cruel* streak, [however]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 See [the] thing [that] looks [like] the red *fist*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It destroys] *walls*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And you *really] need* [to] *buy* that! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([*We'll] see* why [*later*].) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Each level* [is divided into] *several* smaller areas, [*separated*] by *doors (again*, very much like "Wonder Boy [in] *Monster* Land"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Ya only*] have one regular [*attack*], your *staff*, which is [*generally* pretty] effective. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Aside from] collecting *money*, you'll need to find a *key* somewhere in [the] *level*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *game* [doesn't] *surprise* you [with] boss [*battles*]; you actually [get] a *warning* before ya enter the door leading [to the] *boss*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (So [you're] never [*unprepared*], hopefully.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And this is] where the *key* is used. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*SonSon* <Two::II>" [is] a Japanese-[*only* release, but] we [do have an] English *translation* by one [<Sergeant::Sgt.>] *Bow* Hack. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As ya *see*, your character is Son *Goku*, [and] yes, "SonSon..." is [yet] another *game* based on the Chinese *novel*, "[Journey to] the *West*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's way [better than "Super] Monkey *Daibouken*", [though]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *boss [battles* are definitely an] *improvement* on those [in] "Wonder Boy in *Monster* Land". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The bosses in *Sega's games* [were *pretty repetitive*], but *here* there is [definitely] a [bit] more *variety*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This* [first] guy [is pretty] *easy*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When [ya *defeat him*], he unleashes a *huge* [amount] of money. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} not sure why *money* is [represented] by *fruit* [in] this *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *again*, the *fruit* angle *might kinda* remind you of the first "*Wonder* Boy" game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya also] get [some] *bonus* cash based on *how well* ya did [in the] *level*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, I [*keep*] comparing this [to] the 'Wonder Boy' series, [but it] *does* have a more direct *antecedent*, a [*Capcom*] <Nineteen-[Eighty]-Seven::[1987> *Arcade*] game called "[Black] *Tiger*" (or, in Japan, "[Black] *Dragon*"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Black Tiger*" was [exactly] the [*opposite*] of "SonSon" in terms of *mood*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was a dark, violent, 'Sword [and] Sorcery' game, [but] the *mechanics* were [pretty] much identical [to] "SonSon *<Two::II>*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Certain] graphics*, like the [*pottery* that] you [can shatter, and] *even some* [of] the *enemies* were used [in] both *games*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *According* [to] Kevin *Gifford* of '*Mag* Weasel', the [*advertisements* for] "SonSon <Two::II>" *[explicitly refer] to it* as a cutesy *variation* on "[Black] *Tiger*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*SonSon <Two::II>*" has *seven* levels, and *each* r... -- level is [*reasonably*] long. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Some of* the individual *sections* are [*pretty*] big [and] *may* require a [bit] of *exploration*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [underground] *cave* level has some areas [that're pretty] big [*vertically*, and ya] *may need* [to] jump [around and find] the keys [and] shops. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *one* very, very [*important*] thing [to] do *is [to]* find all the staff *upgrades*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *first* one can be found *here*, but [*only*] if you purchase the [*item* that] *allows* you to punch [through] *walls*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That] was back [in the] very [first] *level* - the red [*fist*] thing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And actually], I [don't think] there [are] any *shops after* [that] very *first one* that *sells* it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [ya *literally] had* [to] buy [it at the first *shop*], or [otherwise you can't get] the first *upgrade*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though the [upgrades are *costly* and get] more [expensive later in] the *game*, they're [*pretty] important*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And there] are a [*total*] of six upgrades. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the *bosses* do [repeat throughout] the game, [but] *there [is definitely*] some variety. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [if] *you collected* the *cloud* [item] on [this] level, you [can] summon a *cloud* here, which {will} make this guy much more *manageable*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's *almost*] like a little [*Shoot-'em-Up* battle]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya *might] need [to] do* a [bit] of *grinding in "SonSon <Two::II>"* ([just like in] "Keith *Courage*..."). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] *example, early* [in] Level *<Three::3>*, you [can] buy the *second* weapon *extension*, [but] it *<~cost~::{costs}>* <three-[thousand]::[3,000]> *Zenny*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [don't] have [*enough*]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([And] I [could actually] use [some] *Health* Refills [as] *well*.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*SonSon* <Two::II>" [stands] *halfway* [between] two generations of console [*Platformers*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *looks [better* than] the [<eight::8>-bit] *FamiCom games* [we've] been *seeing*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Everything] is more *colorful*, the levels are [pretty] big [*vertically*, you need to] travel up [and] *down [quite] a bit*, [and it *still* remains] on the same [vertically] scrolling *screen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yet, [it *doesn't completely*] break the rules of [<eight::8>-bit *Platforming* the] way [*later] games*, like "[Sonic] the *Hedgehog", would*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [There's] *nothing* too [*surprising* in] "SonSon *<Two::II>*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still, compared* [to] the [first] "SonSon" *game*, [it's pretty] *amazing*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nectaris 🇯🇵 // Military Madness 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Military Madness" ♪ by Woods

🎧🏮🍊♪ "I hope that the man discovers" ♪
🎧🏮🍋♪ "What's driving the people wild" ♪
🎧🏮🍋♪ "[Military] madness..." ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 February 9 🇯🇵 // 1990 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Alright*, [February is] *here*, [and] *here's* the *game* [we've been *waiting*] for. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *"Nectaris" (or*, as [it was] called [in] the *U.S., "Military* Madness"), the *classic* [Military] *Simulation* Game from *Hudson*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *We* [start] off [with] a [*pretty*] decent *intro*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the far-flung [<Twenty-First::21st>] *century, lots [of] people* have moved to the *moon*, due to its vast *resources*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *I [didn't really] know* the moon had much worth going *after*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [thought it was just mostly] boring *rock*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But what] do *I* know? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Oh*, [and] the *bad* guys are the *Axis* powers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 How *ironic*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, [in] the [original] *Japanese* version, they were called the *Gaichi*, which *[might] be* a corruption of "*geizig*" (or "*greedy*" in *German*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These Japanese [Military] Games [just] *love* throwing in German words, [for] some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the *story* [involves] a *prison* break [and an] atomic [*superweapon*] aimed [at] *Earth*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you've got [to] rescue all the [*prisoners* and] stop the [Axis] *powers*, one level [at] a *time*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Whoa*! An in-game *manual*!? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [*that*] is something *special*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing* [that] makes "[Military] Madness" *stand* [out from] *so many* other [*similar*] games is [that] *everything we [need to]* know is in the actual game *itself*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *You* [can] actually *lose* the *manual* [and] still do *fine*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [includes] general *instructions* as well [as] detailed info on each type of *unit*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a *very nice touch* [that wasn't] *seen* much back then. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "[*Military*] Madness" works *roughly* like most [of] the other Warfare *Simulation Games*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [and] the [computer take turns] moving *[your units]* around [and] *attacking*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's *really* [not that] much [*different* than] "Daisenryaku" or Nintendo's "*FamiCom* Wars". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, in '*Chrontendo*', [it] *seems* like *whenever* we've seen *any* [of] these games, I've [*always*] said, '*Well*, yeah, [this is] *okay*, [but it's] no "[Military] *Madness*".'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [that "Military Madness" is] actually *here, well*, [I'll let ya] know, [playing this] game is [not] going to cure *cancer* or make the [blind] *see*, [but it] is, in my *opinion*, the best game *of* this sort [that we've] seen, so *far*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] *sure* ya know how this works; ya move [your] units around [and] kill all the other *guys*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *early* [levels are pretty short and] easy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You have] *one* more *tank* than the *C.P.U.* [in] the first *level*, and [you can] wipe [out the other] guys [*pretty*] quickly. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Gradually*, things ramp up [in *difficulty*], more units {are} [*introduced*, and it] gets [quite] *challenging*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just like] so [many] other similar *games*, [battles are fought *automatically*] through brief [animated *cutscenes*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *this game*, they're [*pretty short*], so [they] never bog down the *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] *win* by either [destroying] all the enemy *units* or [capturing] their *bases, as* I've managed [to] do *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] the [*end* of each] level, [you] even [get], like, a [little] *graph* showing you the [breakdown] of [what *happened*] during [that] *level*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here's [another]* nice touch. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Between] levels*, [ya] {can} see [your] *progress* mapped [out] on the *surface* [of] the *moon*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This [sorta]* ties the game [together], so [it's not just] a series [of] unconnected levels. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *[what] makes* "[Military] Madness" [better than] all those other [Military] *Simulation Games*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [it's *pretty*] deep, [for] one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Several] factors* figure [into your] units' *strength*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *terrain*, [for] *example*, [which is] *standard*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But [*also*] there's a *surround* effect. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (*How [many* friendly] units are in, um, spaces next [to] *yours*?) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This *has* a *huge* effect! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also Experience* - as [your units survive *battles*], they gain *rank* [and] become more *powerful*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] gain more [units] by [capturing] *factories* (though, as *usual*, um, [*only*] certain types of *infantry* [can] capture factories [or] *prisons*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *there's* a [lot] of [stats and] *info* [to] take *in*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] the *game* does an [excellent] job of *presenting* it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *clearly* shows how *terrain* [and] other *factors* affect each [unit's] *strengths*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Each square shows a [*percentage*] based on the type of *terrain*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *guide* [button will] give ya detailed *info* on *any* unit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It tells [you] how many units each side *has*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And *really*], the organization of *data* here is *excellent*... [which] is *good* because there's a [lot] of *info*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Whereas] "*FamiCom* Wars" had *<sixteen::16>* types of units, "[Military] Madness" has *<twenty-three::23>* types [*total*], which [can be] broken down [into] *Infantry*, Tanks, Aircraft, *Anti*-aircraft, *Artillery*, Transports, [and] the *highly* mobile *Moon* Buggy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Each* has [its] own *Attack*, [Defense, and *Movement*] stats. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And there's [*sort of like*] a '[Rock], Paper, [*Scissors*'-like set of strengths and] *weaknesses*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] *game even looks* [pretty] good. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] uses hexagonal *spaces*, [but] *keeps* the [field *uncluttered*] because [the] spaces [only] appear [while] you're [actually getting ready to] move [your] *units*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And you] *need* [to get] -- keep *track* of all this *info* because the *game* [gets quite] *hard* [as] you [*progress*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Later*] levels [often put] you [at] a [*severe disadvantage* in] terms of *units*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] <sixteen::16> levels on *Normal difficulty*, then <sixteen::16> *Harder* levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], of course, [there's] a password *save* [system]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *There [are] a* handful of [classic <Turbo-[Graphics]::[TurboGrafx]>] games [that defined] the [system's] *early years*: "R-Type", "Alien Crush", "Dungeon Explorer", [*and*] (of course) "[Military] *Madness*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It *had* one [of] the [longest] *lifespans* of a <Turbo-Graphics::TurboGrafx> game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It received] ports [to] U.S. [*computers*], Japanese [computers], the *PlayStation*, the *Game Boy*, the *iPhone*, ... 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *is [one of]* the [best] games [from] *Hudson*, so [if you've] never *played* [it], by all *means*, give [it] a *try*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Moto Roader 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 February 23 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Masaya 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "[*Moto*] Roader" is [the second] *game* from *N.C.S.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Listen* [to] these *fantastic percussion* [sounds]! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *N.C.S. [apparently* developed] some [sort] of *really* [cool] *drum* [synthesizer in order to make] these *sounds*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So, you'll] see *some [of] their* games have these [really] cool *drum [sounds* used in] the [*soundtrack*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *P.C.* Engine [*sound*] chips were [*capable*] of making [some] *really* cool *stuff if* you* knew [what] you were *doing*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *[apparently] N.C.S.* knew [what they were] *doing*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "[*Moto*] Roader" is a [top]-down *Racing Game, similar* [to] the [*sorta*] games [we've been] seeing [on the] *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [only] big *difference*, [of] course, is [that] *this one* uses the P.C. Engine *multi*-[tap], so *five people* could play [at] *once*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's sort] of like the [great]-*granddaddy* of the '*Mario* Kart'-type [games]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's *also] one* [of] those Racing Games where ya win *money* after each *race* [and] use the dough to improve [your] *car*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Nowadays*, [most] Racing Games *work* [like] this, *[but it] was a somewhat* fresh idea [at the] *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the [late <Eighties::'80s>], there were, like, a [lotta] console *Racing Games* [that started] adding in this *feature*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Aside* from the *normal upgrades* (tires, engines, brakes, [et *cetera*]) there are a couple [important] things, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The '*Handle*' section allows you [to] choose the *control* scheme. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Whether controls work from the driver's [*perspective*] (like Left on the [D-Pad is like] turning the steering wheel *left*) or from the perspective of the *screen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([That] is, Up turns [the] vehicle *upward*, Down towards the [bottom of] the *screen* [regardless] of [which direction your] vehicle [is] *facing*.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, the *gas* tank is very useful. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I will show ya why [*later*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [*also* have] these various weapons you [can] buy, [but] they *tend [to] be very* expensive [and] of *limited use* ([at] least in the single-*person game*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They are good for some anarchic *fun* when [*playing*] against other *people*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Once* [out] on the road, *you'll [notice]* the *camera* has a [*pretty* tight] close-up of the screen (*so close* [that] if [you're] in the *lead*, turns [and] *obstacles* will -- can [*certainly*] take [ya] by [*surprise*]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, "*[Moto] Roader*" has a *really insane* rubber-*banding* [system, to] keep all vehicles on the screen [at] *once*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A *vehicle* [that's in] *danger* of slipping off the edge [of] the *screen* gets forcibly dragged *forward* - [and] this consumes *gas*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] *playing* [against the] C.P.U., [you start] off [with] a bad *car*, so this happens a *lot*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If ya run [*outta*] gas, ya *lose*, [unless you use] the *gas* tank [before] the gas gauge goes *empty*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's why the *gas* tank [is] so [*important*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *After* ya finish, [ya get] a cash prize based on [your] *position*, [and] then ya buy [better] parts [and] go on [to] the next *level*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*[Moto]* <~Racer~::{Roader}>" [is not] half *bad*, [as] far [as] top-down *Racing Games go*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *We [have another]* Racing Game [*later today*, and "Moto] Roader" is *much* [better than *that*] one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*outcome*] of the *race* is *always* in *question* because {of} the rubber-*banding*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's *entirely possible* to] be [in last] *place* [for] the *entire game*, [and] then *[right] before the *finish line*, [you suddenly get] *dragged forward* [and] end [up] finishing *second* [or] something like [that]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's *happened* to] *me*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *There [are]* a few other *race courses here*, which are *somewhat* [hidden]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya hafta] *access* [them] through, like, a [secret command in the] *menu*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Suburbs* one is *really*, uh, [*brutal] (tons* of [twists and] turns [and] *obstacles*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And it's *quite] long* [as] *well*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Anyway*, [while "*Moto] <~Racer~::{Roader}>*" [is not] *bad*, [it] was [*really* designed for the] *multiplayer*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Playing* against the C.P.U. [is not really] *worth [it]*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *still*, [it's] a [decent] game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Honey in the Sky 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 March 1 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Face 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Face 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Uh*-oh! Wacky Japanese *game* alert! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Hmm*! There's an M.C. Escher thing goin' on *here*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *From the mysterious* publisher, *Face*, we have "*Hanii in the Sky*" (or "*Hanni* in za *Sukai*", as it's sometimes *called*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *what's going* on here [is] the *god, Izanagi* (or *Izanaki*), is sending a *Haniwa* figure to rescue the goddess, *Izanami*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The rescue operation is [performed] via standard [Vertical Shooting] *action*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, [what exactly]* is a *Haniwa figure*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well, these* [are terracotta] figures [that] were used for *ceremonial* purposes in old-time *Japan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Nowadays*, they're *mostly* depicted like *this*, with big empty *eyes* [and] blank *features*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They *often* turn up in Japanese *pop* culture (like *video* games). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Vertical Shoot]-'em-Ups were a dime a *dozen* back in the [late *<Eighties::'80s>*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] "*Hanii [in the] Sky*" has *one* critical *difference*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *One* [button] shoots [and] the *other* rotates [your] *gun*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] one [of the] first [waves] of *enemies* where ya need to *attack* from a [different] *direction, serving* [as, sort] of, the *training* grounds for the [rotating] *gun*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Later] enemies *include* bloody ghosts of some *sort*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *please* [note that] I'm using [the] '*Turbo*' feature. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Officially-licensed *turbo* controllers were *available* for the P.C. Engine by <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Eight*::[*1988*]>. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *games* like "*Hanii* [in] the Sky" are [almost] *impossible without* them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, ya *do* have a number of *weapons* [and] *items* you [can] buy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya get points] for *killing enemies*, [and you] can *spend 'em* [in] this mini *shop*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*This* is the first] boss by the *way*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just] use the [rotating] *weapon*, um, to, [sort] of, *attack him* [from whatever] direction he happens [to] be coming *at* you from. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *He's actually* [quite] *easy*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Aside* [from] the *weapons*, ya have a few other [*items*] you [can] *buy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The most [*important*] is *Health* Refills. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yes*, you actually hafta buy *health* [in] this game, *one* bar [at] a *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {You} need [to] use your *health* potion [to actually] refill [your] *Health* Bar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] a *[somewhat] clunky* two-step *process*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *these dragons* [are pretty] *cool*, though *[they] do seem*, [sort] of, ripped off from a *similar* segmented creature [in] "*R-Type*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Every* level [or] so, [you get another] upgrade [for your] *weapon*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here*, I have the *dual-[shot]* option. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This gives you *two* guns [separated at] <a-hundred-'n'-eighty-degree::180°> *angle*, so [you can] take [out enemies from] both directions [at] *once*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In these *underground* levels, ya *actually* need [to find] the [right] *path* [through the] level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Otherwise], you'll [just] keep going [in] *circles*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *This boss* is [sorta] like a big *version* of those [segmented] *dragons*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And the] *P.C.* Engine *really* shows off its *power* here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is a *huge* multi-[sprite] boss *moving* around the *screen* in all *directions*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's the *kinda*] thing you would see [in] *Arcade* games of the *era*, [but *not*] on the *FamiCom*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *P.C. Engine* is, [of] course, known [for having] a [lotta *Shoot-'em]-Ups*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *We've* [already] seen "R-Type", "[Fantasy] Zone", "Dragon Spirit", and "Galaga <[Eighty]-*Eight*::[*'88*]>", I guess. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But *this [is* the] first all-[original Shoot-'em]-Up [for] the *system*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *We actually* have a few *more* [Shooters later] {in} [this] *episode*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Hanii [in] the Sky*" is [not] the [best *Shooter] we've s... -- ever *seen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*But it] has* nice *music*, uh, [some] cool-looking *bosses*, *and* [an] unusual *weapon* scheme. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's [*actually* pretty] *good*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *And, as a* lesser-known *game* from an obscure *publisher*, it's a [pleasant *surprise*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *Face* [would later] release a *sequel* of a sort, "*Hanni* in the *Road*", which is, [for] *some* reason, [*sorta* like] the [original] "*SonSon*" game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But it's actually gonna] be [quite] a [while before] we see [*that* one]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Winning Shot 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 March 3 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: DECO 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We are going to start off March with the [first] P.C. Engine game from [Data] East. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This *music* is so *relaxing*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Such* a mellow *groove*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so "Winning Shot" is the first *Golf* Game for the P.C. Engine. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Amazing*, isn't it? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The console's been on the market for a year and a half, and we are just now getting the first *Golf* Game! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, *once* Golf mania hits [a] *console*, it *doesn't* let go, so *expect* some more *soon (way* too soon). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *P.C. Engine* was one of the first *consoles* to, [sorta] -- sort of, focus on multiplayer *support*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "*Winning* Shot" is for *up* to four *players*, but it's *not* really as multiplayer-*specific* as "*Moto* Roader". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, since ya *could* plug in a bunch of controllers at *once* with the *multi*-tap, why not do it? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya *choose [among]* the *various golfers*, each one with their own *stats*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *this sense*, [it] resembles the "*Jumbo Ozaki*..." Golf Game for the *FamiCom* [that we] saw [*quite*] some *time* ago. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *It's a* [reasonably pleasant]-looking *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can take] a [look at] the course [before starting]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The trees have more *detail* than most *FamiCom games*, and there [are] a few different shades of *green*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *We've seen tons* of Golf Games during '*Chrontendo*' (each more boring than the *last*) and [almost] all of [them] using the [exact] same basic *mechanism* to swing [your] *club*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Winning Shot*" actually *simplifies* the standard three-[button]-press *method* down to *two* [button]-presses. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Hit] the [button] once to [start] the [*meter*], and then again [to] *stop* [it]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In *most] [cases*, it's] actually [best to] try [to] press the [button] a second *time* when the line is *right* near the very top. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alright], so *this here* is really *annoying* (trying to get out from ar... -- from behind a *tree*) because you *always tend* to *hit the tree* even when [your] ball is *clearly* a safe distance away. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, unlike *most Golf Games*, it's *difficult* [to hit] the ball *too hard*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Even* [for] *short distances*, you wanna *power-up* the [meter] *really* high. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I *tended* [to not hit the] ball *hard enough* more *often* than I [hit it] *too* hard. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Even* when *putting*, in *most* Golf Games it's *really easy* [to] *overshoot* when *putting*, but *here* it's really easy to *undershoot*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] *courses seem* [pretty decent, with lots] of water [and] *sand* hazard. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Despite] these* levels looking [*difficult*, *most] {of} the time* having the ball *pointed* in the [right] *direction* [and] giving a solid *whack* [will actually] leave you [in a *pretty*] good location. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "*[Winning Shot]*" does seem a [little] easier [than] many of the other Golf Games we've played. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dungeon Explorer 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 March 4 🇯🇵 // 1989 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Atlus 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our big game this *episode* is, of course, "Dungeon *Explorer*" from *Hudson* and [*Atlus*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We [get] a [relatively] detailed [plot] description *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *weird thing* is, [*despite*] on the surface being a typical 'Sword [and] Sorcery' type [*setting*], "Dungeon Explorer" has *aliens* ([not that] you would *know* [that from just] *playing* the game). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *plot's MacGuffin* is something called an *Aura* Stone. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya need to] *retrieve* the stone, which is done by venturing [into] various *dungeons*, *castles*, and *towers*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, the *prologue* is text [*only*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *then we have* this impressive panoramic view of the *game* world, which features five-layer parallax *scrolling*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *people* [often state that the] P.C. Engine [didn't *support*] parallax scrolling, which is *true*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*There was*] not any built-in hardware [support] for manipulating multiple *layers*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] programmers, [of] course, could still [produce] this kind of scrolling via *software* programming, *[just] like* was sometimes done on the *FamiCom*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Dungeon Explorer*" is a game that focuses *primarily* on multiplayer - up [to] five players [at] *once*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] choose [from] *several* different classes [or] *races*: [Fighter], Thief, Warlock, *Witch*, *Bard*, *Bishop*, Elf, and *Knome* (with a 'K'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *I think* [I'll] choose the boring *generic* [Fighter] character. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *imagine* [that] you've never played "Dungeon Explorer" and you're *wondering, 'What kinda game *is* it?'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, the inspiration is *clearly* Atari's *Arcade* hit, "[Gauntlet]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Basically*, ya take a handful of "*Gauntlet*", and a *handful* of R.P.G., [and] smash 'em together, and you've got "*Dungeon* Explorer". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya *have* the typical *R.P.G.* village along with [a] castle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [first] thing you do is talk [to the] *king*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Ya always hafta talk to the *king* in these things.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And he] sets you on a wild goose chase for the *Aura* Stone [and] has you running all over the *kingdom*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Now, while* there are various houses you [can] step *into* and N.P.C.s you [can] *talk* to, there are [not] standard R.P.G. elements like Shops, Inns, Money, or [Items to] *buy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These R.P.G. [*elements* that] *do* [exist] are added in very [*lightly*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *once [ya enter]* a *dungeon*, the game goes full "*Gauntlet*" on ya. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Enemies [*infinitely*] respawn [out of] these [*portals*, scattered around] the *rooms*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Destroying the] *portals* [will stop] the flow [of] *enemies*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *This [doesn't* quite] go to the "Gauntlet" extreme of having solid walls of enemies filling up half the *room*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But as the game progresses, it does throw *overwhelming numbers* [of] bad guys at ya. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] *character does* have a *Level*, [as] well [as Hit Points, and] stats. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Stats can] be [raised] by *picking up* an [*item*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There's *axes* [that] raise *Attack*, [little] shoes with *wings* that raise *Speed, all* the usual stuff. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, *these* [don't *permanently*] raise [your] stats; when ya die, ya lose all these *gains*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, ya *do* have *other* ways of [permanently] raising [your] stats, [but] this [is] done through *boss* [battles]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Killing* a boss grants you what *appears* [to] be a spinning C.D.-*ROM*, but is *actually* a *crystal* or... something. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] increases your Level by *one*, as well as [your] maximum [*Hit Points*], and ([depending] on [what] *color* [it] is when ya *grab it*) [it will] raise one specific *Stat*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] stats [can] affect [your] options while *exploring*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 My *speed* is too *low* because I died not [that] long ago. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I [*can't*] overcome the gust of [wind that's] blowing down the *corridor*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] need [to] go [around and] take these *longer*, more *dangerous* path, *which [requires]* walking by all these *flamethrowers*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [*hate*] these things! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [as] a game aimed for four [or] five-person *multiplayer*, the *single*-player variety is *hard*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] *possible*, [but it] takes *way* more dedication than *I* have. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [in] *order* {to} see the game's *ending* ([and] there's [actually] *two* endings) I've activated a [*cheat*] mode using a special *password*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing* [about] "Dungeon Explorer" is [that it] *does* [have] a [*pretty* great] sense [of] design. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] a lotta weird *monsters*, things like the jets [of] flames look [really *great*], there's a [bit] of variety in the *dungeons*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *overall* game is [pretty] *repetitive*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it's mostly just: *enter* [the] dungeon, *kill* [the] boss (which unlocks a new *area*), [and] then proceed [to] the [next] *dungeon*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *There* [are] a few *mini*-quests thrown in *here*, like rescuing a *Princess* (which is what we're doing *now*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Once* this is done, she gives you a *password*, which unlocks a special *mode* that allows you to play as the *Princess*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This* is a *really* cool *touch*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you [can] also play [as] a [*hermit*] character [that] you [encounter] midway through the *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *As* I mentioned, "*Dungeon* Explorer" was developed by *Atlus*, and it's *probably* about the first good Atlus game to reach us in the *U.S.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In '*Chrontendo*', we've seen all those *cruddy games* Atlus handled for *L.J.N.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And of course there's also "*Quark*" for the *Game* Boy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But [with] "*Dungeon* Explorer", the *whole thing* is [just] *dripping* with atmosphere [and great] *music*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Alright, *here's* the *fake* final boss - this dragon thing that guards the Aura *Stone*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 After [*defeating*] him, you'll [exit] this fiery *corridor* [and] see the Aura Stone *itself*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As ya *carry* [it] back [to] the castle [to] give [it to] the *King*, you'll probably think, '*Hmm*, that was *too easy*.'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *And*, sure *enough*, the King [starts] *acting* like a major *asshole, then*... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Oh*! It's *Natas - King Satan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} *[not] sure* why [he] calls [himself] '*Natas*'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's [not gonna] *fool* [anyone if] he follows [that] up by [referring] to [himself as] 'King [*Satan*]'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [at] *this* [point], you're supposed to travel to the final *castle* [and battle] King *Natas*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] if [you're] *playing* [with a *cheat*] on (which allows [ya to] go, uh, through [solid] *objects*) you [can] do this *instead*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A *truly* awesome ending. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Apparently], the rules [of succession in] this *kingdom* [state that the first] guy [to sit on the] throne becomes the *king*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is actually] the *bad* ending. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [To get] the *good* ending, ya need [to] *go back* down, {and} [track] Natas, [and] *defeat* him. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I} *love* the flying *eyeballs*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess [that that] Aura Stone [wasn't] so [hot] after all; [I mean], I still *killed* the guy by stabbing him [to] death. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} [didn't] make [him] all-*powerful* [or] anything. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And I'm] *still confused*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Were the *kingdom's* problems caused by the *Devil* or the *aliens* [mentioned in] the *prologue*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or [are] they somehow *connected*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Anyway*, now the real King appears, the game *ends*, [and ya get some] silly credits. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Overall*, "Dungeon Explorer" is a [*pretty*] solid *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [there] *were* [some] sequels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A [second] game -- game came [out for] the <*Turbo*-Graphics::*TurboGrafx*>, which [got] a [Super] *FamiCom* port under the *absurd* name of "*Crystal Beans*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There was a Sega *C.D.* game, and, uh, much [later] Hudson [released] some '[in] name [only]' sequels on modern *[handheld] consoles*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *really*, the *original* [is the] one [that] everyone *remembers*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, just like "Military] *Madness*", it's one of the *core* [titles] on the <Turbo-Graphics-Sixteen::TurboGrafx-16>. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Out Live 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 March 17 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the [first] P.C. Engine game [from] *Sunsoft*, "*OutLive*" (or maybe it's "[Out] *Live*"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Out *Live*" [is not just] *any* game, [but an] *R.P.G.*, though one [that resembles] a Japanese *Computer* R.P.G. more than "Dragon Quest"-style *Console* R.P.G.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here* we have the Science Fiction [*setting*] and the [first-person] *viewpoint* [that] we [tend] to [associate with] a [certain style] of R.P.G. [that] turned up on the, uh, P.C.-[<Eighty-Eight::88> and] M.S.X. *computers* in the mid-[to-late <Eighties::'80s>]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *once* we [get goin' here, we're gonna start] by buying [some equipment]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a *Gun* Shop, [and] an [*Item*] Shop, [and] a *Mechanic*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you *are* given a [little bit] of very [basic] plot here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But ["*Out Live*" really sorta] takes [its] cues [from] games like "*Wizardry*" or "Deep *Dungeon*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *entire game* world *outside* [of the] *dungeon* is *basically* [just] a *menu* [with] a few [different] *options*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's no *villages*, o... -- overworld, [or] -- or [*that* sorta] thing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *once* we're done with the rather meager offerings of the *shops*, it's *time* to *hop* into our *F.W.* (or *mech suit*) and [start] the *action*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [*I'll* admit], "Out Live" is not the most sophisticated R.P.G. there *is*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... The graphics [are pretty] *minimal*, [in] some *ways*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] there *is* a definite sense of visual *flair* going *on*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya *view everything* from *inside* the *cockpit* of your mech. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's *actually* [pretty] *spacious*-looking! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The dark] corridors are [illuminated] by those [softly] glowing lights, which *I think* looks [pretty] *cool*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Really*, the *minimal* approach works [pretty] *well* here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] looks [better than] all those stone *walls* we've been seeing on so many "*Wizardry*" clones on the *FamiCom*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Naturally*, we have *random [battles]*, which are *turn-based* [and handled] through *menus*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] no surprises *there*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though there *is* a nice *touch*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] see [your] *gun* firing when you *attack*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, I *foolishly* neglected [to] buy any *healing* [items {at} the shop before setting] *out*, so I quickly got lost in the *dungeon*, and my health slowly dwindled down [to] *nothing*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[As] you [can]* imagine, it's *hard [to]* find [your] way *around*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] *dungeons* are [just] a series of [identical] *corridors*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well], *occasionally* they change *colors*, [but] this is [pretty] much the entire *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya *make* [your] way [through the] *dungeons*, grain -- gain [experience and] *money* (occasionally spending money on [equipment and items]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [*certainly* not] the most [original] R.P.G. [we've ever] *seen*, [but it] *looks* [pretty] cool. 🍇🍌

✅🍪🍊🍓 I *think* they are both the same in terms of *attributes*, though they have [*slightly* different] a... -- *sword* attacks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *guy* slashes *upwards* and the girl slashes *downwards*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [Shubibinman] *sure* [sounds] like a [character from an] *anime* or *one* of those live-action Tokusatsu *T.V. shows*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *But* this is [an original *property*] (though one [that's *supposed* to] have, like, a T.V. superhero *feel* to it). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The story [should] be *familiar*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Aliens invade *Earth*; a couple [of] kids in high-tech armor [set out to *defeat] them*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} sounds [sorta] like "Keith Courage...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And it] *plays* [just about as] well [as] "Keith *Courage*..." does. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "...*Shubibinman*" is a very basic FamiCom-style [*Platformer* with] *two* distinctive *qualities*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When ya *jump* on the *many*, many [floating] *platforms* [in this] game, they *[tend to] do* weird unpredictable *things*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *(<Two::2>)* [it] *has some* of the most *creative* [hit detection] in any video game *ever*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *What ya do* is ya *cruise* [around] town killing bad guys [and] picking up the *huge* [gold] bars they drop. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Seriously*, these *aliens* are *loaded down* [with] *gold*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] the *[end] of each* [relatively short] level, [ya fight] a *rather* lame *boss*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The boss doesn't, uh, drop any gold or give you any [sort] of *direct* rewards. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [don't] even [get] a *Health* Refill. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya hafta] *buy* those. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *how come*, after *picking up* those big-ass bars [of gold], I [only] have, like, <one-*hundred yen*::*¥100*> to my *name*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Something* is [*not*] right here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Levels* [alternate between] the park scene, city scenes, and some [sort] of *sewer* scene. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [*check* this out]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[This is what] I* mean by [creative *hit* detection]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It'll *probably*] take a while [to get used to] the game's *controls*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] *character* has a [certain amount] of [weight and] *momentum*, [and] the [ground tends to] be a [little] *slippery*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, when [ya *start] moving*, [ya sorta get, like, that] 'Scooby-Doo' *effect* [where your] legs [are] working, [but] you [aren't] moving very *much*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *[bottom] line* is the *controls* feel [a little] *weird*, [and] *jumping* [onto] the crazy [*platforms* will] give you a *headache* [at] *first*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Especially* [if ya] fall [into] the stuff [at] the [bottom of the] *sewers*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*What*] is [that]? *Lava*? Raw *sewage*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Whatever* it] is, *touching* [it causes] you [to] fly [*upwards* towards the] *ceiling*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If [ya hit] a flying *enemy* on the *way*, you [might get] bounced back [into] the lava, [et] *cetera*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's *just disconcerting* the] way [that], *in this* game, *everything* moves *so slowly*, *except* when ya touch the *lava*; then *[suddenly], 'Blam!'*, you [shoot out] like a *rocket*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Overall*, [it's pretty *repetitive*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya *face* these *dragon bosses* over [and] over *again*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And *speaking* of weird [*hit* detection], I mean, [you know], (well, *you guys* watching the [<thirty::30>] frames per [*second*] version [might not be able to] *see* this, but the boss *flashes* [when ya *hit* him]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] yeah, [I'm *hitting*] him, [despite] being halfway across the *room* sometimes. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *As we see* on the map, there [are *multiple] paths* [to the] boss' *lair*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can *get] there* [in] four *steps*, but you [*often* get special rewards for completing certain] *stages*, like money [and] *healing* [items]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *You [can]* use the *cash* [that] you [obtained] by killing *monsters* [to] buy *upgrades*, so [it *might*] be worth [your] time [to] play [as] many stages [as] *possible*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here*, [we] have a [better] *weapon*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] *tell* because the blade [is] now *red*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Overall, "...Shubibinman*" is *[not] a very* [exciting] *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's very *repetitive* (especially the *bosses*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Aside from] the [great] *music*, it [*doesn't* really] take [advantage] of the P.C. Engine's *hardware*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *looks really* very much like a FamiCom game, except [with brighter] *colors*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Like], *Look* how *small* [your *sprite*] is, [for] example! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *final* boss [of] each area is more [*impressive*] as [we'll] see in a *moment*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *overall*, [it's just] a [bit] lame. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [for] *some reason*, [it] *would warrant* a few *sequels*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the [*next*] game [in the] series *somehow* got a *U.S.* release under the name "*Shockman*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess [we'll] be stuck seeing [that] in future '*Chronturbo*'. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 P-47: The Freedom Fighter 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 March 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: AiCOM 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*We've* got some] more [*Shoot*-'em]-*Ups here*, such as "*P-<[Forty]-Seven::[47]>...*", another game from *AiCOM*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] *never* a good sign when a game has a [completely] silent [*title*] screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The "P-<[Forty]-Seven::[47]>..." Thunderbolt *was* a World War *<Two::II>*-era [*jet* fighter that] was used a [lot] in [the Pacific *Theater*] by [the United] *States*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, [just like] Capcom's '<Nineteen-[Forty]-*Two*::[*1942*]>' series, we have a Japanese *game* in which you play as the *U.S.*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! *Finally*, some *music*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now, you've *probably*] never *heard* of, uh, "*P*-<[Forty]-Seven::47>: [The Phantom *Fighter*", but it] *was* a <Nineteen-[Eighty-Eight]::[1988]> game [from] *Jaleco*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *The intro* here [at *least*] makes [it] *clear* [that you're] killing *Nazis*, [not] *Japanese*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*It* was] a very unexceptional Horizontal [*Shooter*], which [*sorta* resembled] Konami titles such as "*Gradius*", [at] *least* [in] the *game* mechanics. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It was} *nothing* very special, [but it] had [decent] parallax *scrolling* [and] big loud *sound* effects. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *home version* is [*not quite* as] impressive. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *foreground* is reduced to a few *houses* [and] *tanks* rolling along the *ground*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *music* [is] okay, [but] the [*sound effects* don't] convey the same feeling of *death* [and *destruction*] as the *Arcade* game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *as a game*, "P-<[Forty]-Seven::[47]>..." is very *simple*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya fly around, shoot planes... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes, a *power-up* will be *dropped* [that] gives you a secondary *weapon*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*These* greatly resemble] those [from] "*Gradius*"; [ya have] missiles, bombs, [et *cetera*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] these [are often used] by [hitting] the, uh -- the [*second button*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [As] *far* [as] *I* [can] tell, [ya *can't* really increase] the *power* of either [your] *main* weapon *or* the special weapon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *really*, [ya shouldn't] expect any cool *weapons* [at] *all* [in this game]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Bosses* [are just] bigger *planes* [from what] *I* saw. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], oh *look*; I'm bombing a *church*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [bet] Nintendo [of] *America* [wouldn't have] allowed this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I *can't* figure [out how to] *kill* [this] guy, or even if ya *can* kill [him]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Shooting] him* [doesn't] even seem to cause [him] to flash [or] anything [to indicate that you're] doing *damage*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I dropped *tons* of *bombs* on [him, but] *nothing* happened. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Eventually*, he [just] flew away. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} not sure if I won the battle or not. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *[And] then*, the [*next*] level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sure, [the background looks pretty, but the bullets are] all *yellow*, [and] the enemy [projectiles tend to] *blend [into]* the *background*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ({That's} *not [really]* a good idea.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Really*, "P-<[Forty]-Seven::[47]>..." [is] not so much *terrible* as [it] is *boring*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a *[totally] generic* [Horizontal Shoot-'em-Up], in which nothing [exciting] or [different] *happens*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Basically*], there's nothing *[cool in this]* game [that] makes you go, 'Whoa!'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *There [are]* a few tense [*moments*] (like all these *rockets* coming at *you*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But *really*], there's *nothing* special [about] "P-<[Forty]-Seven::[47]>...". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 F-1 Pilot 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 March 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Pack-In-Video 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Oh, man! This* looks like a bummer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "F-<One::1> *Pilot*"? 'You're *King* of *Kings*'? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Did *Pack-in-Video* have *any idea* what that *term* actually *means*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*F-<One::1> [Pilot]*" is the [first] P.C. Engine game from the *video [distribution]* company, Pack-in-*Video*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *And* it's *not* a promising *start*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *You [can]* choose [between] several [different] cars, though *each* is [just represented] by the same *vehicle* [with] a [different] *color*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They *appear* [to] have [different] *stats*, [but I'm *not*] sure there's [actually] any *difference* in the game *performance*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Make *sure* ya study this map [and] memorize every *twist* [and] *turn* on the course. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, [ya get] a choice of [*soundtrack*]: either just the, uh, actual *engine noise* with *no music*, or one of the two [*untitled* musical *selections*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *here's* [the] *thing* [about] the [soundtrack]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] the engine noise version; it's [*pretty*] annoying. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *However, let's check [out]* the *musical* [soundtrack] options. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This also [starts with just] the engine *noise* [before ya start] *moving*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *then... 'Oh*! So the engine sounds *disappear*!'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess the programmers [couldn't get] the music *and [sound effects* to] play [at] the same *time*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *playing [this* is] actually really *weird*, [because there's absolutely] no *connection* to the *audio* [and what's] happening in the *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When ya crossed over [to] the side of the *road*, [ya don't] hear all the *squealing* [and] stuff [that] indicates [you're not supposed] {to} be *driving* there, which is the same chirpy music just moving right along. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} gives the game, like, a *weird detached* feeling. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Anyway, I'd* say [that] "F-<One::1> [Pilot]" [is *about*] the [worst] game [of] this [sort] we've seen, so *far* (I mean, aside from the *sound issues*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya *might notice* [it] *doesn't* give you a *map* of the *track* during the *race*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Nor* [does it] give you *any* kind of warnings [before] the curves [in] the *road*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [ya *can't] see* the curves [until right before ya *hit*] them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Part* of] this [is] due [to] the *camera* [just] being so low [to] the *ground*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the way [the] perspective is *handled*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Maybe* this is *intended* to be a form of *realism* - just like real F-<One::1> drivers [need to, like], memorize every *twist* [and] *turn* through *practice*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But it's *not*] [really] a [lot] of fun [to] *play*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the *various* tracks' [backgrounds] look okay, [but] *nothing* is really too [*exciting*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is England *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is [*Italy*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *then ya have those* two huge rectangle side-view *mirrors* [that] look [really] *stupid*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *also, [despite*] there being [different] types of *cars*, they *all* have the *exact* same *top speed* of <three-hundred-twenty-nine::329> kilometers per *hour*, which *makes me think* [that] all the cars [are] *functionally* [identical]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Even* the *name* is stupid. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "F-<One::1> *Pilot"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Since *when* does one ['*pilot*'] a *car*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, there was a Japanese [*jet* fighter] called the F-*<One::1>*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When [ya first] see the game [*title*], you [assume this is] a *Flying* Game, [not] a *Driving* Game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Throughout*] the course [of] the P.C. Engine's lifespan, *we'll* see *plenty* of Racing Games, [but] *I would be [surprised]* if there were many that were worse than *this* one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shiryō Sensen: War of the Dead 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 March 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Fun Factory 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Victor Musical Industries 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Hmm! [That is]* some annoying *music*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Alright*], from *Victor* [Interactive] *Software*, we have "*Shiryō Sensen*...", a.k.a. "...*War [of]* the Dead". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, the *[title] screen* actually says 'War [of] the Dead' in *English*, so that's what we'll *call* it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this *is* gonna be a *tough* one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *box* [art] makes the game look *super cool*, [but] "...War [of] the Dead" is a game [that] is *[brutally] archaic* [at] times. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This [is] seen [at the] very *beginning* when you enter the *church* [and] talk to the *N.P.C.s*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Walking up [to] them activates the *dialogue*, [but] *pressing a [button]* does [not advance] the *text*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Instead, [it] *closes* the dialogue *window*, [and] you need {to} take a small *[step] back*, then walk up [to] them *again* [to get] the next line of *text*, [and] keep [*repeating*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is just about] the craziest way of advancing dialogue *ever*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And *hey*! You like password *save* systems, *right*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Check *this* baby out! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *passwords* are <fifty-four::54> characters *long*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *<Fifty-four::54>*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "...*War [of* the] Dead"'s roots lie [in] Japanese [*computers*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [first] version appeared in <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Seven*::1987> on the M.S.X.*<Two::2>* [and] was [developed] by a company called '*Fun* Factory'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Pretty] spooky intro*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*It was*] a slow-moving top-down [*Adventure*] Game with [irritating] Action sequences thrown *in*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*According* to] Hardcore Gaming <One-O-*One*::*101*>, [it] was *so buggy* [that it's *literally impossible* to] *finish [it* without] using a *cheat*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Later*], "...War [of the] Dead" [received] a [port to] the P.C.-<[Eighty]-*Eight*::[*88>, including*] this all-new *intro, [and] a number [of]* gameplay changes were added as *well*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *P.C. Engine* version has the *advantage* of nice [bright] *colors*, [but] the *Action* sequences are [still just] *hair*-pulling. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These guys take, like, a hundred stabs [to] *kill*, and [they can] kill *you* [in] a couple *hits*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And [to] make [matters] *worse*, [multiple] *monsters* attack you [at] *once*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Great. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, [what sorta]* game is "...War [of the] *Dead*"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [it's] an Action R.P.G.-[ish, vaguely] "...Zelda..."-type *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya *walk around* on this huge [*overworld*, which is actually supposed] to [represent just] one *town*, [apparently] (just a very spread-[*out*] town). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you'll occasionally encounter random [*battles*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *sudden transition* from top-down *exploration* [to] side-view [*battles* has] led *many to compare* this to "Zelda *<Two::II>*...", which was also released in <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Seven*::[*1987*]>. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Though*, where many of "Zelda <Two::II>..."'s random [battles] were [mostly] *useless*, [at *least*] the *monsters* [in] this game drop experience, health, [and] *sometimes ammo*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Ammo's* [quite] *limited*, [and your] guns [are almost *completely] worthless* [against] many *monsters*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] *easier* [to] run *away* from [most] *fights*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This [has]* led some to label "...War [of] the *Dead*" [as], like, the *first* Survival *Horror* Game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *does* have a [bit] of a cult *following*, [and is supposedly] a [fascinating] *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *But*, *I dunno, playing* [it], I get the same feeling I [get] as watching a Béla *Tarr* movie. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm [told it's important*, and] *good* [for] you, and I [should] appreciate it, [*but*] I [just don't get] it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's like *eating*] a huge [plate] of boiled *spinach*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *primary* objective ([at] least [at first]) is [to] bring back survivors [to] the *church*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These [are] found in various *buildings* scattered around the *world* - or rather, the *town* (schools, hospitals, [and *that* sorta] thing). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Naturally, all [of this]* has {to} be done [in] a very [particular] *order*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya hafta trip] the various *triggers* [before] anyone [will] agree [to] *leave* with you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like *this* guy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *'Dammit, man*! 🍇
✅🍪🍋🍓 I'm tryin' to rescue you [from] *monsters*. 🍇
✅🍪🍋🍓 Why [won't] you come *with* me?'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Probably*] the Action *sequences* are [what sorta] kills the *game* [for] me. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, the *gun is* even more y... -- worthless [than] the *knife*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I would [*probably* use] up all my *bullets* [tryin' to] kill this one *guy*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *supposedly*, once you *gain a couple levels*, the game gets [*better*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [*only*] the [first] couple hours [are] *painful*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] I *still* wonder why [your] character has *brown hair* [in] the *box art*, but *green* hair *in-*game**. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Anyway*, [this is probably just for] hardcore *fans* of [forgotten] Japanese [*Computer] games*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Everyone else* [better] stick [to] "Dungeon [Explorer]". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ganbare! Golf Boys 🇯🇵 ✨

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 March 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: KLON 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: NCS 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Okay*, it's game <number *three*::#*3*> from N.C.S. [*today*], a.k.a. *Masaya*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Though this game [doesn't] actually *show* the Masaya *logo*.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's some nice *bass* [in that] tune! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Once again*, the *music* is [the] main thing [that] "Ganbare! Golf Boys" has *goin'* for [it]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Winning* [Shot" sorta] messed [around with the] standard Golf Game *mechanics*, and *so does* "Ganbare! *Golf* Boys", which would be good if [only] "Ganbare! Golf Boys" weren't so damn *boring* (even for a *Golf* Game!). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [this is gonna confuse] you the [first] time ya try [to] play, because [it] *looks* like the typical three-[button]-press *system*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But *then*... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *What*!? It [didn't] even reach the *fairway*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} barely moved [at] *all*! ([And] my timing was [almost] *perfect*!) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If your *timing* is [*not* perfect], the ball {will} [probably only] go [about <twenty::20>] *feet*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *here's* the deal: *[Before] swinging* the *club, use* the *D*-Pad to move that *red dot* further along the *arc, all the way [to] the* end. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Now*, [it'll get] a halfway [decent] *distance* (though the *stupid* game *resets* [it for] every single *swing*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Until ya] reach the *green*, you'll [*probably*] need [to] move [back that] red [dot] all the way every single *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya *also*] have to [adjust] the *crosshairs* each time ya take a *shot*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya know], a [*lotta*] Golf Games [would automatically start] by pointing [out] n... -- the [right] *direction* [for] each *shot*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Ganbare! [Golf] Boys" is [not only] *boring*, [but it] makes [ya] do a [lot of] extra *work*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Other* than its weird *swing mechanics*, there's *really* nothing about this game [that] makes [it] stand *out*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, if [you]* saw "Winning [Shot" and thought], 'Ooh, that looks good, [but] I want an even *crappier Golf Game*.', then [this is] the one [for] you. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Deep Blue: Kaitei Shinwa 🇯🇵 // Deep Blue 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Pack-In-Video 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *We've [reached]* the last day of *March* <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Nine*::1989>, and we have "Deep *Blue*" from Pack-in-*Video*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This received a *U.S. release* from *N.E.C.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*That's* some appropriately] moody *music* - [sort] of a keyboard *dirge*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *we* [just] saw one mediocre Horizontal [*Shoot*-'em]-Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And now we have *another*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Deep Blue*" is a [*little*] more [interesting] than "P-<[Forty]-*Seven*::[*47*]>...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It actually] has [an] *underwater* theme. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [*might* recall an old] *FamiCom* game [from] *Irem* called "*Sqoon*" [that] was [sorta] *similar*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And there *also* was], of course, [Taito's], uh, '*Darius*' [series]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In "*Deep Blue*", you [control an] *angelfish* - or *actually*, I *think* it's a *ship shaped* like a fish. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That's what] the cover [art] seems [to] *indicate*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm [not] sure why [ya would] *design* a ship to *look* like a fish. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Maybe* [you're tryin' to] fool the [inhabitants of] the *ocean* [into] thinking [that] your heavily-armed *submarine* is [*actually* just] a harmless [little] *angelfish*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Obviously, it didn't] *work*, because all the fish [are] *attacking* you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Or *maybe* the other sea creatures [aren't even] *trying* to attack you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Maybe* they're [just] *swimming* around [and you're in] their *way*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [At least in] the [*first*] level, *they [don't* really] act *aggressively*, so much as there're [just] so damn *many* of ['em ya keep] bumping *into* 'em. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [From *what] I [can]* tell, the [Internet doesn't really] *like "Deep Blue*", and I [don't really] like [it] either. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Part of] the *problem* is [there -- *doesn't really] resemble* a [traditional *Shooter*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And that wouldn't] normally be a [*problem*], except [that] if "*Deep* Blue" [is] going [to remove] *most* of the [*elements* that] make [Shooters] *enjoyable*, [it should *replace*] them with something else *equally* enjoyable (which [it doesn't] *do*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *"Deep Blue"'s* main gimmick is [regenerating health]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Notice] the color* of your fish's *eye*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} starts out *blue*, then [as] you [get hit it] turns *green*, [and] finally *red*, [and] then ya *die*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, when [you're not *shooting*] your *weapon*, [your] health slowly [*regenerates*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a *good idea*, [and] *nowadays* many [first]-person [*Shooters*] use a [similar] *idea*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the [regenerating] health [is the] one thing that "Deep Blue" brings [to the] *table* [that's] a [little *original*], aside [from] the [aquatic] *theme*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, what's *missing*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Just* about] everything you would normally *want* in {a} [*Shooter*], such [as interesting] *enemies*, cool *weapons*, detailed *backgrounds*, big [*explosions*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], of course, some sense of *accomplishment* [that] occurs when [your little] ship single-[handedly defeats] an entire *army*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here*, it's more like, '*Hurray*! I survived a *fish* stampede.'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [You're just tryin'] to move around your slow bulky ship, and try to avoid the [constant] *onrush* of schools of *fish*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When [your] *health* is *good*, [you should] try [to] fire off [as many shots as *possible*] with [your *peashooter*], which is (*along* with the one in "*P*-<[Forty]-*Seven*::[*47*]>...") one [of the most pathetic peashooters in] video game *history*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's *weak*, it fires *slowly*, [and] (since *so many enemies* move [in], like, a *sine* wave-like [*pattern*]), it's *really easy* [to] miss *everything*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Enemies* [mostly] move too *quickly* to apply much [*strategy*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's more [about] firing [*blindly* and] hoping [that -- that ya *hit*] something. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, uh, [you know], memorizing enemies' [*patterns*] is very *useful, you will* [inevitably get] *overpowered* [and] take some *damage* (which means ya hafta *stop* [shooting and] try [to] regain some *health*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Quite] frankly*, the *best tactic* seems {to be} to, sort of, *lay* [in] *wait* in the *corner*, [shooting *constantly*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [will] help you to avoid *most*, if [not] all, *enemies*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *All [of] this* makes "[Deep] Blue" [just pretty] *boring*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's [just] wave after wave of fish *swimming* [at] you [incessantly], with [virtually] no *variety*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a *shame* [because] I *like* the idea of an [underwater Shoot-'em]-Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But, *unfortunately*], after playing "[Deep] Blue" [for about] five {to} ten *minutes*, [it starts to] feel like a real chore. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 KyūKyoko Tiger 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 March 31 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Toaplan 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Another* major arcade *company* makes its P.C. Engine *debut: [Taito]* with "KyūKyoko *Tiger*", a [port] of the Toaplan-[developed] *Arcade* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *As* was [the] fashion [at this] *time*, [this is] a military-themed [*Shoot*-'em]-Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] *this* case, ya fly a *helicopter*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *I'm [not]* even sure [what] the *story* of "KyūKyoko Tiger" *is*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I assume there's some [sort] of *war* going on, [but] *Toaplan* [doesn't] really give us *even* the *faintest hint* [of] *plot* in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *works* [just] like the classic [*Shooters*] [of] the [late *<Eighties::'80s>* and] early [*<Nineties::'90s>*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One [button] fires [your] *main weapon*, which [can hit] both air [and] surface *enemies*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *other [button]* drops a *bomb*, which does a *huge [amount* of] damage [to] everything within [its] blast *radius*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Special* [enemies], such [as] the large *helicopter* here, drop *power*-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These increase the *effectiveness* of your main *weapon*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "KyūKyoko Tiger" originally saw [light] of *day* in *arcades* [in <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Seven*::*1987*>]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Well, [it *didn't literally*] see the [light] of *day*; arcades were *dark seedy places*.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *In the U.S.*, [it] was called "Twin *Cobra*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was the [second] game in Toaplan's '*Tiger*' series (the first being "Tiger *Heli", which received* an N.E.S. [port] a [while] back). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Japanese* [titles] both use the word '*Tiger*', [which] shows the connection [between] the two *games*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Unlike* "Tiger *Heli*", [which was released] in the *U.S.* on the N.E.S. by *Acclaim*, there *never was* a <*Turbo*-Graphics-*Sixteen*::*TurboGrafx-16>* "Twin *Cobra*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] a Japanese-[*only*] release. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though a *Genesis [port]* [did] come [out in] the U.S. a [little bit *later*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *looks* [and] *sounds* good. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Certainly, it's light]-years [beyond] the FamiCom "Tiger *Heli*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Though *one thing* I've noticed is [that] the *P.C. Engine* version is [*quite*] a [bit] easier. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a couple *reasons* [for] this - less *enemies* on-screen [at] *once*, [for] *one*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, [your] *helicopter* [can] move *faster* in the *home* version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the *Arcade* game, you were so darn *sluggish*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Maybe* this was, uh, done [to] make up [for] the [fact that] there's no <Two::2>-*Player* option. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also, enemies* seem [to] fire off far fewer *projectiles* on the *home* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Regardless*] of this, it's *still* reasonably *fun*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Another* enemy-dropped [item] is an *icon* [that will] switch your *weapon*, depending on the *color* of the [*item*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here*, I have [the] Four-Way *Shot*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] been powered up [quite] a *bit*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, [and] the *bomb* effect is [pretty] *cool*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *You will* need [to] pick up extra bombs, [from] *time* [to] *time*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But really], uh, the [*best*] weapon, [in] my opinion, is the "Contra"-esque *Spread* Shot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If [ya *get] this thing powered up*, you [will] basically be *death* on *wings*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here's* a *boss*, a large *tank*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Spread [Shot* will actually allow ya to *hit him* from] the *sides* [and] avoid some [of his projectiles]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [He] catches *fire* as he takes *damage*, [and] once he [explodes], he [leaves] a [*crater* in] the ground, [*which is*] a cool *detail*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While the *game is* [pretty straightforward], there *is* a *hidden weapon* option. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 By *using* the *Select* [button] when picking up this [particular] *weapon*, it'll give [your] shots a *homing missile*-type function. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's *[pretty] cool*, I suppose, [but] I *actually* like the Spread [Shot *better*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And *while* this is] a [really] good port, *I [don't]* think [it] really [stands] up [to] the [best Shoot-'em]-Ups [for] the *system*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I mean, it isn't exactly] Toaplan's best *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] enemies all seem a [little] *generic*; it's [*pretty repetitive*] compared [to] something like "*R*-Type". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} *seems* like *every* P.C. Engine [Shooter] so far gets [negatively] compared [to] "R-Type" by me. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Anyway*, [it's] a [*pretty decent*] first offering [from *Taito*, but] I'd categorize [it] as a *good* ([not] *great*) game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Cobra: Kokuryū-Ō no Densetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 March 31 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Alright*, we have *one* last game here in *March*, and it's our [only] C.D.-*ROM* game, "*Space Adventure Cobra: Kokuryuuou* no *Densetsu*" (or 'Space [Adventure] *Cobra*: Legend of [the] Black *Dragon* King') from *Hudson*, who are *still* the [only] *publisher* [to produce] C.D.-*ROM* games [for] the *console*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Just*] like "*No-Ri-Ko*", "...*Cobra*..." takes advantage of the C.D. [format to reproduce] *perfect* human speech. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "...*Cobra*..." is [actually sort of] a [landmark *title* in] a *few* ways. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 First [of] all, *check [out]* this intro. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In *Japan*, the P.C. Engine was [marketed] towards *[slightly] older* gamers, and "*Space* [Adventure] Cobra..." is *clearly* aimed [at] those who've [already reached] *puberty*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *P.C. Engine* and its *follow-up*, the P.C.-*F.X.*, would do a [*lot*] of business with Adult *Games*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And while "...Cobra..." is [not] really an Adult *[title], I'd say it's* the *first* mainstream console *video* game to [devote] a *[lot] of energy* in detailing the female *form*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] filled with lots of *loving depictions* of boobs [and] butts. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Every woman* is dressed [in] something either very *revealing* or [at] least skin-*tight*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And there's also quite] a [bit] of sexual *innuendo* [in] the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] thing opens up [with] some ladies playing space [water] tennis *skiing*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They are [later] revealed [to] be High School *sophomores*, which seems... [*sort*] of *unlikely*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Much* of *this* was due [to] the game's *origin*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a *manga* from Buichi *Terasawa*, which ran from the [late <Seventies::'70s> to] the mid-[*<Eighties::'80s>*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was, [of] course, turned [into] several [animated] movies [and] *T.V.* shows. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *It's [about]* a roguish, cigar-chomping space adventurer type who's [completely irresistible to] *women* (naturally). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] what's sort of weird is that the *French* director, Alexandre Aja, is [*supposedly*] directing a live-*action* version in the near *future*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "...*Cobra*..." is, of course, *[an] Adventure* Game, *but* one with very high [*production*] values. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] *fact*, the series *[creator], Terasawa*, was [involved] in the *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And it's] *very much* like every other Adventure Game we've seen, though the *game* uses a [*lot* of] *kanji* - uh, again [indicating it] was aimed [at] a [*somewhat*] older *audience*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Ya have [your]* typical 'Look', 'Investigate', 'Talk', [et] *cetera* commands. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Most* {of} the dialogue is done in on-screen *text*, [but] *voice acting* is used [from] time [to] *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the [*quality* is quite] *high*; Hudson used [professional] *voice* actors. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Unfortunately*], this tradition would [not] carry over to most English *localizations* on the <Turbo-Graphics-*Sixteen*::TurboGrafx-*16*>, which are [*noted*] for having *tons* of games with *really* terrible *voice* work. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "...*someone* in *mind; let me* handle this". 🍇
✅🍪🍋🍓 "Is it *over*?" 🍇
✅🍪🍋🍓 "He's *entrusted* me with the task." 🍇
✅🍪🍋🍓 "So you'll ask him *then*?" 🍇
✅🍪🍋🍓 "The [only] person who could *possibly* fight the force project is..." 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Alright*, so ya *wander* [around] looking around [and] talking [to] people [and sorta] try [to] suss [out] the *plot*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Performing] the [right] commands [will] unlock more *menu options*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[And] then*, of course, [you need to perform] those actions in the correct *order* in [order to] move [the] story *forward*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Right] *here*, [I'm] talking [to] those *supposed* High School *sophomores* [in] a *bar*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*plot*] seems [to] revolve [around] this *alien artifact* which Cobra wants [to] *steal*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's [also] being [followed] by some mysterious figure. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 From *[what] I understand*, the game is *reasonably long* for [an] Adventure Game of this *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [it] must [have] been *successful*, [since] a *sequel*, uh, came [out] a [bit *later*], which [has] even [got an] English [*release*] on the Sega *C.D.*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [When we] *compare* [this] to the *previous* [three] *<C.D.-ROM-ROM::CD-ROM²> games* (which were, uh, "[Fighting] Street", "No-Ri-Ko", [and] that, uh, "*Bikkuriman*..." disc - which *[wasn't] even really* a *game*), we [can] see [*just*] how *impressive* "Space Adventure Cobra..." *is*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Of [course*, unless you're] very good [at] reading *Japanese*, [this] game [is really not gonna be able to] be fully *appreciated* by you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] we [can definitely] see how [it] is, [*sort* of], a [groundbreaking *title*] in the world [of] console [Adventure] Games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Regional Box Art Comparisons ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 *I'd* like [to point out] a rather [unfortunate] *trend - namely* [that] the *box* art [for] the U.S. <Turbo-Graphics-*Sixteen*::TurboGrafx-*16*> is often *way worse* than the [original] *P.C. Engine* box [art]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 By far, the worst *offender* is "*Dungeon* [Explorer]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The *Japanese*] cover was *okay* - [not] too [*exciting*] - kind of* classy, I *guess*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then *this*! *Why*!? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This looks like it was] drawn by a *<twelve::12>*-year-old! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Who would buy* a game [with this] *cover*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *sequel* had much [better] art, *thankfully*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Or "Vigilante"*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese art? *So cool* [and to] the *point*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *looks like* an early <Eighties::'80s> *V.H.S.* cover to an old *Slasher* movie! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the *U.S.* version? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Boring*! (with no [character at] all). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] least "[*Moto* Roader" got] a [better] cover [in] the U.S.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] makes the game [*look better* than it] really *is*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 3 Wrap Up ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *anyway, what's* our Top Game this episode? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Hmmm... [I'll] say* it's a *tie*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Dungeon [Explorer" and "Military] *Madness*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Take* [your] *pick*; both are [standout titles for] the *console*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the *[Worst] Game [today]*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'll] say "F-<One::1> Pilot". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, *really, how hard* is [it to] make a [decent] *Racing* Game? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Apparently], too *hard* [for] Pack-in-*Video*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I *think* [it was the fact that the] *sound [effects* and *music* don't] play [at] the same *time*, is [what put it over] the *top*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *next "Chronturbo*..."? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [We'll] cover *March* [through] *June* <Nineteen-[*Eighty*]-Nine::1989>, *including* the *first entries* in two [popular] *series* ([popular] in [*Japan*, at] least) - *one* from *Human* [and] *one* from *Hudson*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 See ya *then*! 🍇🍌
