👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 20 ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hey, thank you for tuning in to 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And guess what? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's another special anniversary episode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's "...Episode 20" of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 How are we going to celebrate? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, there is a little bit of bonus content for this episode, I suppose. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We're kicking off a semi-regular feature here on 'Chrontendo'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But aside from that, it looks like to be a [pretty] good episode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We got a lot of big names going on this time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo, Konami, Square, Rare, Jaleco, Irem, S.N.K., (the whole bunch), even (oddly enough) a port of a Sega game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, let's start off with our really, really big game this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic 🇯🇵 // Super Mario Bros. 2 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "The Theme" ♪ by Wallenstein

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 10 🇯🇵 // 1988 October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Fuji Television 🇯🇵 // Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Everyone loves a good story, right? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The story behind this game is probably one of the most widely distributed among the video game community online. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you're watching this, you probably already know it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic", a very curious release. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's the big game this episode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, while being developed by Nintendo, it was published by Fuji Television. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 First thing to note, I guess this is what you would call a Konami-style intro, here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This tells the events leading up to the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo hadn't really done this before, tending to [prefer] simple text scrolls for their intros. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the main novelty of the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You choose among four different characters, each with slightly different character stats. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Yume Kojo' (or 'Dream Factory') was a multimedia exposition staged by Fuji Television in July 1987. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Fuji [and] Nintendo collaborated to release a game based on the expo's mascots. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This would have undoubtedly been good publicity for both Nintendo and Fuji. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, this is not just any Nintendo game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nope! This reunited what you might call 'The Nintendo Dream Team' - Shigeru Miyamoto, Takashi Tezuka, and Koji Kondo. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Their previous two games together were "...Legend of Zelda" and "Super Mario Bros." (really, not a bad resume). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The resulting game was much closer to "...Mario..." than "...Zelda" (being a side-scrolling Platformer) with enemies very similar to "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The little POW thing is taken directly from the original "Mario Bros." game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, taken from "...Zelda" was the ability to take multiple hits, and even increase your Life Bar by finding hidden hearts. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Note the extremely crazy waterfall in the background. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So fast as to possibly cause, uh, well, some kind of epileptic seizure or something if you're not careful. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the novel gameplay mechanic introducing "...Doki Doki Panic" is that you attack enemies by throwing things at them (your main source of ammo being the *plentiful* root vegetables growing everywhere). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, according to the official and frequently repeated [Nintendo mythology], every game Miyamoto produces is somehow inspired by his personal life. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, "...Doki Doki Panic" was presumably born from his love of gardening, and possibly also his love of exterminating household pests, such as mice and frogs. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 While "...Doki Doki..." does use repeating bosses, it doesn't really do [so to] the extreme of "...Mario Bros.", um, as there are several different types. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's the very first one, here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., it's known as 'Birdo' (the somewhat gender-confused creature which rather horrifyingly lays eggs with its mouth). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 All the bosses in "...Doki Doki Panic" need to be defeated by throwing things at them. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, your techniques will need to change depending on the layout of the boss's room and its different patterns and so on. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In between levels were treated to this little slot machine minigames where you hopefully can get a few lives. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Presumably this was based on Miyamoto's compulsive gambling habit. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Something else [taken] (seemingly) from "...Zelda" was keys. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You'll often come across locked doors and need to grab a key. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I suppose there's even a certain amount of backtracking involved, here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, you'd have to go up to the top of the room and get the key, grab it, and then go back down and open the locked door. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here is one of the more well-known bosses, Mouser (a bomb-throwing mouse wearing sunglasses) and, like Birdo, he is a pattern-based boss. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Run up, grab them as he throws them, and then set them down in exactly the right place, so they actually gets hit by the explosion. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Of course, using bombs to kill a mouse (even a rather large one) does seems a bit like overkill. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, I'm not one to accuse Nintendo of trying to pad out a game, but there is one curious little feature, here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Namely, that in order to actually complete the game and get, you know, the quote-unquote "real ending", you have to play it four times. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yep! Every time you, sort of, go on to the next chapter, you get to, uh, change your character if you so choose. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, you must complete the game one time in full with each character (as, when you switch characters, basically you go back to where that character left off last). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It was first time you played them, you will be back at the beginning of the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Since this was, of course, a FamiCom Disk System game, you can save the progress. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, of course, many of you will recognize this game and already know that it was used as the basis for "Super Mario Bros. 2" in the United States. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There, of course, already had been a "Super Mario ... 2" released in 1986 in Japan. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We covered it back in "Chrontendo Episode 8". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But that was a, uh, simply new, more difficult, uh, levels of the first "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In today's terms, it almost seems more like an expansion pack (or maybe even a hack) than a true sequel. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For whatever reason, supposedly Nintendo of America president Howard Lincoln did not like the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese "Super Mario Bros. 2" was not released until for Super Nintendo era. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It was on the "Super Mario Bros. All-Stars" game collection as "Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, for the U.S. version, there's been actually quite a bit a little, sort of, graphical makeovers and enhancements. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, the waterfall here goes much more slowly. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You'll notice the characters' sprite are very nice; these are actually probably the best looking, uh, 'Mario Bros.' character sprites in any 8-bit game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There was a completely new storyline added - nice little character selection scene, um, the leaves on the plants, sort of, uh, blowing in the wind a little bit, there. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The slot machine segments were given a rather deluxe makeover. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, now we come to the, uh, rather sensitive issue among '...Mario...' fans. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Is this game good? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And is it a quote-unquote "real '...Mario...' game"? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You know, some folks claim do not like "Super Mario Bros. 2". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, well, they're wrong. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They're just flat-out wrong, because this is a great game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it's better than the, you know, the so-called real "Super Mario Bros. 2". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 That it is a lot different than the first game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... But so what? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Super Mario Bros." was nothing like the original "Mario Bros.". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "...Mario R.P.G...." was nothing like the previous '...Mario...' games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, while it's true, this is not as fantastic as, uh, "Super Mario Bros. 3" but, then again, few games are. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And as we know, there is this weird little rule about N.E.S. sequels. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They tend to be, sort of, like the black sheep of the family. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Think of, uh, the second games in the series '...Zelda', 'Final Fantasy', 'Castlevania' - they all went in a weird direction before turning to a more classic style of gameplay for the third entry. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the bottom line: ya know "Super Mario Bros. 2" is a good-looking, well-crafted, fun game with an amazing amount of variation in gameplay (um, especially for a FamiCom title of this vintage). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We can definitely see a little bit of influence of, uh, "Metroid" and "Kid Icarus" here, with the vertical levels added in, not to mention the fact that you occasionally have to do a bit of backtracking. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In true "Mario Bros." fashion, there's a lot of little secrets. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, here, you jump off the waterfall, land on that little platform, and go into this cave, you can get some, uh, bonus gold coins. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the fact you can now choose between four characters also adds a bit of, uh, gameplay depth. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, Luigi can jump higher, Princess Peach can, sort of, hang in the air for a couple seconds (though both can't pull vegetables as fast as Mario can). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And this was actually, sort of, lifted from "Super Mario Bros. 2" (the Japanese version) where Luigi could jump higher than Mario. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Choosing the right character for each level will make for easier going. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, here Princess Peach can, sort of, jump over everybody and avoid all those enemies. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unlike in the first "Super Mario Bros.", the bosses tend to increase in difficulty. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, Birdo now shoots fireballs as well as eggs - and you have very little horizontal room in which to jump and grab the eggs. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here we can see the "Kid Icarus" influence with the vertical levels and the spins that wrap around from left to right. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obtaining a key will also cause Phanto to come to life and chase after you. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Super Mario Bros. 2" is probably a bit trickier in the first game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But the fact that extra lives are so easy to come by make it quite possible to finish the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Much like in "Super Mario Bros. (1)", you can find various, sort of, hidden warps to later levels gives you little shortcuts. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, for me, the one issue I have with the handling is when climbing on vines or chains. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's real easy to land on a vine and then immediately fall off. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This happened to me years ago when I played it for the first time and it happened to me again this time. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Other super cool elements: occasionally you will reach the next level via a rocket ship, which grows out of the ground. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This, by the way, is an early example of the often hated 'ice level'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Konami happened to use these in "...Goonies II" and "Esper Dream". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But here, you know, it's actually very well implemented. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can actually, sort of, use the ice to your advantage by making enemies slide off the ledges. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's a good example, right here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And there're, of course, there are, you know, all the various sorts of cool secrets and shortcuts and it's really everything that you would expect from a '...Mario...' game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Which raises a question. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 How exactly did this end up becoming a '...Mario...' game? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, according to you know, sort of, like the standard versions of the story that you hear on the Internet all the time, Nintendo of America just, sort of, [grabbed] some random game and slapped Mario sprites on it, thus hoodwinking the global U.S. gaming public. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, you know, I don't really know if I believe that. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, who localized the U.S. release? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Supposedly, it was Miyamoto and company, themselves. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But what were Nintendo's actual intentions while making this game? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, think about it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is a big and certainly rather expensive game from Nintendo's top creative team (one that would not be released in the U.S. with Fuji's TVs characters). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I can assume that, much like Sega's 'Wonder Boy', Nintendo owned the game, but Fuji own the names and the characters [only]. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, we don't know the details of Nintendo's previous deal. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But clearly Nintendo must have had the option to release it themselves outside of Japan. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And apparently Nintendo had the option to rerelease it themselves in Japan (I would guess after about a period of five years because this game was released as a 'Super Mario' game almost exactly five years after the original release in July 1992, as "Super Mario U.S.A."). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I, for one, just cannot believe that while this game was being developed (here we have the same guys who made "Super Mario Bros.", making a game that's very similar to "Super Mario Bros.", that another company would have limited rights to - at least for a little while) that no one was working on this and said: 

🟥🍪🍋🍓 'You know, there isn't a "Super Mario..." sequel in the U.S. yet. 🍇

🟥🍪🍋🍓 Maybe we can kill two birds with one stone, so to speak.🍇'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I know what you're probably thinking, 'This isn't anything like "Mario Bros."!'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But on the other hand, of all the games that Miyamoto had developed so far, which one does "...Doki Doki Panic" most resemble? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 How many other games let you jump on enemies without being killed and have you collecting coins, climbing vines? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 We know that Miyamoto felt the need to make [pretty] substantial gameplay changes to the '...Zelda' sequel. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And is "Zelda II..." really any more similar to the first "...Zelda" than this game this is to "Super Mario Bros."? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And Miyamoto had no problems, uh, officially integrating this into the '...Mario...' universe. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, was this game perhaps developed with Mario in mind, at least at some stage of the developed cycle? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess we really have no way of knowing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But to me this somehow just, sort of, feels like a '...Mario...' game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, going back to the game itself (and watch out there are some spoilers ahead) note the kind of, uh, "Kid Icarus"-y influence and that level, right here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is one of the, uh, great moments in the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You grab the little crystal orb to, uh, go on to the next level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And then when you go to go through the, uh, Hawk's mouth (like you've been doing over and over again) it comes to life and starts attacking you. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is like almost like, uh, "Metal Gear", sort of, purposely messing with your game -- with the gamer's expectations. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's really one of the, uh, great moments in video games. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the final boss is actually very cool. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 He's like this giant toad you'd have to destroy using, uh, vegetables. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 '...Zelda' fans might recognize him from his cameo appearance in "Link's Awakening". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, how successful was "...Doki Doki Panic"? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You know, I'm really not sure. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But "Super Mario Bros." sold quite well here, as (presumably) did "Super Mario U.S.A." in Japan. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo re-released the game again as "Super Mario Advance" for the Game Boy Advance. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, once again, some people just don't like this game, or feel it's not a real '...Mario...' game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I personally think that criticism is a little misguided. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hell, we can just say it's the spiritual sequel to "Super Mario Bros." (kind of like "BioShock"). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Super Mario Bros. 2" is an improvement over "...Doki Doki Panic". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Both are exceptionally playable games [however] - better than about 99% of the FamiCom releases so far. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the ending is a little odd. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The whole thing was a dream. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But it started out with Mario dreaming and waking up. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, was he dreaming that he was dreaming? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Maybe all the Mario games are dreams. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the reality is just a regular plumber living in Brooklyn. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It is, sort of, weird that Princess Peach would like be hanging out with skilled laborers as much as she does. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, this was this episode's big game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, now let's move on to the rest. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hector '87 🇯🇵 // Starship Hector 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 16 🇯🇵 // 1990 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ah! It's "Hector '87". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Another Shooter from Hudson Soft, who were, of course, the same guys who gave us "Star Soldier" (one of the best Shoot-'em-Ups we've seen for the FamiCom so far) and would later go on to create "Super Star Soldier", "Final Soldier", and so on. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, I was quite looking forward to "Hector '87" (that was "Starship Hector" in the U.S.). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, did you notice on the start screen there were the, uh, two high score modes (two [and] five minutes)? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We'll discuss that in a little bit. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, like I said, I was really looking forward to this game, uh, hoping it was, sort of, continue on in the same directions that our Shooter maps were going with "Star Soldier". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, "Hector '87" is definitely not the, sort of, game I was expecting. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It seems to draw inspiration from "Xevious" with its separate bomb and laser controls. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ground enemies can [only] be damaged by bombs. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And "Hector..." also reminds me a lot of Compile's "Zanac", especially the bosses, where you need to shoot out a series of gun ports in order to destroy it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 All this sounds fine. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But the cool things about "Star Soldier" were the power-ups and the various destructible elements, uh, found that you can shoot for points. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Hector..." has none of that. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's right! This game has no power-ups. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You're stuck with a peashooter the entire time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the post-"Gradius" era of Shooters, this seems a little weird. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I suppose "Hector (uh) '87" was, sort of, going to, like, a -- a retro feel, here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... Even in 1987 I assume that some gamers were getting a little bit nostalgic for the good old days of Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Incidentally, at this time, Hudson was holding a yearly festival Shoot-'em-Up competitions called the Caravan Festival. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Hector '87" was this year's entry. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Later years would feature the other 'Star Soldier' games as well as "Blazing Lazers". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 These were point-based competitions (hence the two in five minute modes in this game, so you could practice racking up points as quickly as possible). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But getting a lot of points in "Hector..." is hard because killing enemies is so hard. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 A lot of enemies take multiple hits. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 These things come flying righto at you, you start firing away, and then they fly up unharmed, or worse, they just slam right into you. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oddly enough, the boss battles are much easier than the rest of the levels. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, this brings me to -- Another issue I have with the game is that it's simply too damn hard. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This makes "Zanac" look like a walk in the park. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hell! I did better playing "DoDonPachi" the first time than I did with this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I think it's just a matter of too many enemies, uh, and you have just too little firepower. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... "Hector..." is actually one of the hardest Shoot-'em-Ups I've ever played. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... In fact, you -- you just seems sort of like too damn underpowered on this thing. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm sure Takahashi Meijin is great at this game, but you really need to be able to fire 16 shots a second in order to take some of these enemies out. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, while "Hector..." certainly has its fans, uh, for me, after "Star Soldier" there's just no turning back. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's a good example right here, that guy on the ground - he just flies right into ya. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's so many enemies in this like that. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And if you die, you go all the way back to the beginning of the level. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess I say this game is too hard. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... It's really not enough fun to play. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's really too few rewards for your effort. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And there's just too many damn enemies that are too hard to shoot. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dragon Slayer IV 🇯🇵 // Legacy of the Wizard 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 17 🇯🇵 // 1989 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nihon Falcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // Brøderbund 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Wow! All the heavy hitters are, sort of, packed together in the first half of this episode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 With that in mind, we come to "Dragon Slayer IV: the Drasle Family" (or maybe Drasle Family). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it is the first FamiCom game from the successful Japanese Computer game company, Nihon Falcom, though this was actually published by Namco. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'But what', you say, '-- what about "Dragon Slayer (I)" through "...III"?'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, it'll be worth taking a minute or two to look at the previous history of the Falcom games. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The first "Dragon Slayer" game was released to the P.C.-88 way back in November 1984 and is a pioneering Japanese proto-Role Playing Game came. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It came out just a little before the original release of "Hydlide". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We saw the M.S.X. port of this game back when we were discussing the first 'Dragon Quest' game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It seemed described as an R.P.G. on the title screen, though it's missing a lot of the defining characteristics of R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It, sort of, resembles "...Tower of Druaga", which was released same year, or maybe, uh, early U.S. Roguelike Games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You roam around the dungeon collecting objects to slay a dragon. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, it's [pretty] ugly and not really something you want to try playing nowadays. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, much, much better looking is "Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu", again released for the P.C.-88 in October 1985 (about the same time as "Super Mario Bros."). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though it was later comported to other computers like the F.M.-77 and the M.S.X. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Dragon Slayer", you could customize your character (for example, by entering these rooms and paying money to increase your stats). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Apparently "...Xanadu" was a huge hit in Japan (one of the biggest-selling Japanese Computer games ever). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's not exactly a very playable game, though a much better sequel was released for the FamiCom later in 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Dragon Slayer", this probably could be classified as an Action R.P.G. with its, sort of, heavy focus on stats and your typical 'Dungeons and Dragons'-style setting. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, third (and definitely the most impressive opening sequence) was "Dragon Slayer III: Romancia", released in October 1986 (also known as "Dragon Slayer Jr."). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Note the big-eyed anime-style characters and very awesome opening music. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If nothing else, Nihon Falcom definitely had some classy presentation. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "...Romancia" was a lot like "...Xanadu": side-scrolling Hack-'n'-Slash with some R.P.G. elements (kind of like "Chester Field..." - another game we'll see later this episode). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It was also ported to the FamiCom a little later in 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Later titles in the 'Dragon Slayer' series were "Sorcerian", "Legend of Heroes", and "Lord Monarch". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Falcom would, of course, go on to create the 'Ys' series, which had a very similar battle mechanic (basically just to cut your sword and ram the enemies). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, while Falcom had found quite a bit of success making games for Japanese computers, apparently by 1987 they must have seen which way the wind was blowing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And they took "Dragon Slayer IV..." directly to the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, it also got an M.S.X. release. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Incredibly, it was also released in the U.S. by Brøderbund as "Legacy of the Wizard" with a much, uh, cheaper-looking title screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This, of course, is the U.S. version that we're playing, here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The "Dragon Slayer IV..." is similar to the earlier games, but with a twist: you can select which family member you want to take in the dungeon. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Each has different attributes and abilities, even equip them with various objects you picked up using the, uh, equipment selection screen just a moment ago (though some accessories can [only] be used by certain family members). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I started off with the Father, Xemn, and, uh, once you come back to the house, you can then save and change characters. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The object is to descend into the dungeon (the entrance is rather conveniently located right next door to your house), and then to collect four crowns, and to beat the final boss. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, also to find the various objects necessary to do this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, the magic glove allows you to be able to move certain blocks. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is required to get past certain rooms. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 At this point, the game start, sort of, resembling a giant, uh, "Sokoban" Puzzle Game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You come across the various sorts of treasure chests. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 When you kill enemies, they'll drop things - for example, uh, health refills, magic refills, keys (which are very important that you'll come across various lock doors throughout the game), Gold. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... All those little gauges up there will tell you how much you have as well as which items you have equipped. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh here is a scene of moving the blocks around with the magic glove. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Kind of a tricky little mechanic. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the thing to understand about "Dragon Slayer IV..." is just how big and difficult it is. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This dungeon, um, has a total of 16 screens by 16 screens and virtually every single one is filled with multiple exits, puzzles, dead ends, hidden doors, breakable walls, et cetera. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It is one enormous and incredibly complicated maze. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can't just walk from one end to the other. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I finally managed to get up into this area, but then it looks like I've actually reached a dead end. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And that could be or... 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ah, I found the secret exit, right there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Inside that little, um, treasure chest is actually the pointy shoes or the spike shoes which allow you to jump enemies and I got a loaf of bread there as well. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, there're respawning monsters in every screen if you go around like changing blocks, uh, next when you go back everything will be back to the way it was originally. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, here I'm playing, uh, Pochi (the family pet). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Monsters will not attack him and you need to use monsters {who} actually get past certain areas. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's the thing; certain areas can [only] be accessed by certain characters, sometimes by [only] using certain items. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And maybe those items are [only] found in areas accessible by certain other characters. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, the [only] way to really get through the game is by lots and lots of trial and error and endless exploration. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Neither the manual nor the game itself gives you even the slightest hint about how to get through the game or what to do. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here, of course, is the requisite inn. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's also shops found in this dungeon as well. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, while "Dragon Slayer IV..." sounds like a cool game, it is, in fact, impossible to make any sort of progress. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The dungeon is so large and difficult to navigate. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The player will really never have any idea exactly where you or what you're supposed to be doing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 With games like "Deep Dungeon", you could draw your own map, but here, forget about it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This place is way too big and complicated. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nowadays you can find maps online but even then it's not exactly easy to avoid getting lost. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so I found one of the crowns here with Pochi. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This will teleport me to the boss, which is, sort of, a giant red tick, I suppose. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Keep in mind that the controls and I guess the, uh, combat is not really user-friendly. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's a common complaint in Falcom games. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, honestly, how anyone has ever finished this game is completely beyond my comprehension. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, you can go online, you can find the walkthrough, but (even then) still gonna be [pretty] difficult. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And while I do like exploration-based games like "...Zelda" and "Metroid" and love all the secrets and hidden things in the '...Mario...' games (you know, it gives them replay value), Falcom is really taking it too far. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They really seem intent on punishing the player. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I get the feeling that Falcom was thinking, 'Oh, "...Zelda" was easy? Well then, try this.'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Really, Falcom kind of come across as jerks for making this game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jongbou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SNK | Micronics 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by K Amusement 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Aw! Look at that cute panda. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Hey!', you think, 'You know what be really neat? An "Arkanoid" clone with a Mahjong theme!'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well then, "Jongbou" is the game for you. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yep, this is a home version of the Arcade game "Mahjong Block Jongbou" which also came out in 1987, courtesy of S.N.K.. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Remember back before they made tons of Fighting Games, they put out typical Arcade stuff, such as "Ikari Warriors" and "Athena". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And they also created games, especially for the Japanese market like this one. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, for your amusement, S.N.K. also threw in some cute anime-style girls. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade game uses a rotary dial but, unlike Taito, S.N.K. didn't put any special controllers for the home version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This means that "Jongbou" is controlled by the D-Pad. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And just like any other "Breakout"-style game that doesn't use a paddle, you tend to sacrifice a bit of speed and control. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, the game does play reasonably well. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the object is either to clear the screen or obtain Mahjong. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hitting the tiles will cause the Mahjong tiles to drop. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And then catching them will allow you to add them to your row. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's also a couple of power-ups, which I just missed, there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now once you've caught a tile, the game will pause while you select the piece to discard. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Except, of course, if that last piece just happens to complete your hand. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Other than that, it's [pretty] clear how this game works. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nothing too surprising, here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As far as "Arkanoid" clones go, "Jongbou" seems [pretty] basic. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I didn't really encounter tons of power-ups or that sort of thing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There is nothing that allows you to shoot lasers or anything like that. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Tiles don't look nearly as clean as they do on the Arcade version but they all -- they are still largely legible. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I think I'm getting, there. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The last one I needed. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Should you actually complete your row (as I just managed to, somehow) you'll rack up some points and then move on to the next level. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, "Jongbou" seems to have loading times, uh, which on a cartridge game is [pretty] odd. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Last time I saw that problem was with "...Super Monkey Daiboken". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here I find one of the relatively scarce power-ups. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It creates like a force field causes the ball to move slowly and then straight down after it passes through. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is quite helpful but it does make the game a bit more slower and boring than it should be. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fantasy Zone 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega | Sunsoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Fantasy Zone": a game you may have heard of. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In fact, if you've been following along with 'Chrontendo', you will definitely remember me gushing over this game in "Chronsega Episode 1". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's right! I'm not sure why or how but this is a Sega game on the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Originally an Arcade game (this version right here from 1986) "Fantasy Zone" was a very early entry we now call the, uh, Cute-'em-Up genre. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It was ported to the Master System (seen here) also in 1986. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And this was a [pretty] decent looking port very playable. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I like the Master System version quite a bit when I covered it in 'Chronsega'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, first of all, let me point out this is not the same version of "Fantasy Zone" that was released in the United States for the N... -- N.E.S.. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That one was by Tengen, and this one is by Sunsoft. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yep, Sunsoft (those weirdos). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now I have bitched about Sunsoft before (namely the utter lack of anything resembling consistency in their releases). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You really never know what to expect with Sunsoft and, uh, "Fantasy Zone" is a bit of a surprise. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just a little refresher, you fly around blowing up the larger bases while being harried by smaller enemies and collecting coins. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you blow up all the bases, you'll face a boss - and you can also spend the money in the shop to buy power-ups. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (We saw the shop there just a second ago.) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, most of the weapons-based power-ups are strictly temporary. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Here's the first boss here - a giant log shooting (I assume those are) seeds at you. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Most of the weapons power-ups [only] last around 15 seconds or so. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though the, uh, speed-up power-ups are permanent and a lot of the bomb power-ups [only] have, like, well, basically [I] have to buy them one bomb at a time. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, here is the completely awesome spread shot or seven way shot. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And very lo... -- short-lived but completely wipe out almost an entire level is in this thing if you hurry it up. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and almost all the bosses are enormous and [pretty] awesome. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Some of the best Shooter bosses I've seen so far - quite whimsical. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One cool thing about this version (missing from the S.M.S. version) is the vertical scrolling. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the Arcade version the screen is, sort of, scroll up or down a bit as you reach top or bottom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That was jettisoned for the S.M.S. but actually implemented, here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, there's a part of the, uh, heavy bomb or the 16-ton bomb, which is kind of cool because it's taken right out of Monty Python or something like that. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Will kill any enemy other than the boss with, uh, you know, one shot. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Master System couldn't quite capture the originals cotton candy colors and cutie graphics but a decent job. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, the FamiCom isn't quite up to the task either, but still looks [pretty] darn good. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm still a... -- at a loss as to how Sunsoft may have acquired the rights for this to be released for the FamiCom or why Sega wanted this released on the FamiCom, but nonetheless here it is. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Batsu & Terii 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Use 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Use 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You know, I like this intro. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In fact, I think they like it better than the whole rest of the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For you Kasoga fans, well, here is your supply this episode, "Bats & Terry" (a.k.a. "Batsu & Teri"). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Only] thing about this intro is I don't see what it has to do with this game at all. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, let me tell ya, this is one really funky game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not surprisingly it turns out it's based on a manga from one Yasuichi Oshima. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It concerns, well, basketball and motorcycle gangs - not to mention a guy who wears his pants way, way too high. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hence the name bats. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not too sure about Terry. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, a movie had also been released in 1987. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, what exactly is this game about? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I don't know. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Apparently Bats and Terry are escaping from a prison camp or something. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Or rather they're racing? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I don't know. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Mako no Tetsujin race" is the subtitle. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Mako' means 'devil world' and, uh, these guys are apparently (well, I don't know) they're going through a race through hell or something. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, this is Terry; he throws baseballs. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh I love the fact that when you shoot someone and then they continue to move their little explosion will move with your character (as opposed to staying put). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's some really great, uh, programming, here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And Bats and Terry living like the industrial area of '...Mario...' world or something. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, some of the enemies seem, uh, completely invulnerable to your baseballs. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 What's going on? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here there's like trees growing out of the sky? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Really, nothing in this game seems to make any sense, whatsoever. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It was a [pretty] short level we had, there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, eventually through, uh, going through all these various kinds of shenanigans. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here we are at that same hut again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We will eventually like enter into like some sort of sewer system or 'dim base', as they call it. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing about "Bats & Terry": 🍇
🟥🍪🍋🍓 That's one really ugly color scheme. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is definitely one of the ickiest looking games I've seen for a while for the system. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, apparently there are cars driving around in the sewers? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it doesn't really make much sense. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And what exactly is that guy doing? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it shouldn't really be like, I don't know, rats or giant frogs or something in this level? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's the final level of the first part of the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I assume these caves are the 'devil world' section that was promised in the title. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's a boss coming up, here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ah, so it's a dragon. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hey! What? What just happened? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I killed the boss by running into him? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That must be the lamest boss ever. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, well, next time you're playing a game, have a hard time with the boss maybe give that a try. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You never know; it might work. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, so this is one just really awful game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 From the stupid enemies (that you can actually completely avoid half the time) to the horrible level design (it acquire a lot of like completely pointless jumping) this game is really a complete failure. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Exciting Basketball 🇯🇵 // Double Dribble 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 24 🇯🇵 // 1987 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's our obligatory Konami title this episode, "Exciting Basket" for the F.D.S.. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Prior to making a fortune with countless variations on "Dance Dance Revolution", Konami was well-known in the Arcade for lots of sports titles. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Track & Field" was enormously popular in the mid-1980s. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And another Arcade huge hit at this time was 1986's "Double Dribble". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 While this was Konami's second Basketball Game (the first being 1986's "Super Basketball") "Double Dribble" set the Gold standard for Arcade's hoops. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is the Arcade version here; aside from using lots of human speech samples, it also have these super cool full motion cutscenes. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, a home port was inevitable. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You start this by choosing your time, team (there's four teams clearly based on the Lakers, Bulls, Knicks, [and] Celtics) and the difficulty level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 On the F.D.S. this was rebranded as port of the 'Exciting Sport' series. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And "Exciting Basket" does bring a lot more pixelated excitement than last episode's "Exciting Billiards". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, just recently, we saw Sega's "Great Basketball" in "Chronsega Episode 3", which was the first 8-bit console Basketball Game, and that game was [pretty] awful. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Thankfully, Konami avoids all the pitfalls found in "Great Basketball". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For one, you can actually physically approach another player without getting a foul. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can also steal a ball without fouling. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The constant fouls were one of the things that made Sega's game virtually unplayable. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, you use one button to switch control between the players and to shoot and the other to pass. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Passing is perfectly implemented as it goes off [pretty] much without a hitch. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Switching players doesn't work quite as well, but I'll discuss that in just a sec. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Shooting is, again, very easy and three-point shots can be obtained very easily by shooting from certain spots on the floor. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though, for some reason, the game calls it a 'goal' whenever you score a basket. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing that is unique to the F.D.S. version is the nice rather beefy-sounding, uh, sound effects as you dribble the ball. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One gameplay change: uh, the Arcade "Double Dribble" had three buttons. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One of them had to be used to actually to dribble the ball. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That is, kind of like in "Track & Field", you had to be constantly pressing the button in order to get your player to dribble the ball and to move. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For the Console port, this is clearly been dropped (as, well, that would have been [pretty] damn annoying). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, obviously, Konami released this in the United States under the Arcade name "Double Dribble". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Note the game logo looks, sort of, like the official N.B.A. logo in a non-trademark-infringing sort of way. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You also get the national anthem playing during the intro. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Konami released this in the U.S. [pretty] darn quickly in September 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And really not much has changed. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The C.P.U. in the U.S. version seems a little more difficult. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It virtually never misses a basket. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And its players are [pretty] evasive when you try to take the ball. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it just moves really fast. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 After you score a point and the C.P.U. takes control, it'll sometimes, sort of, quickly execute a full court pass and then immediately shoot. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., the game is [pretty] well regarded. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it's really not hard to see why; I mean, just look at this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That is pure awesomeness, right there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess that might not seem like much nowadays back in 1987, it was [pretty] darn impressive. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Compare this to something like "10-Yard Fight", which is a [pretty] good game, but, sort of, lacks the visual drama of "Double Dribble". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This game really set a [pretty] high standard for, uh, 8-bit Sports Games in general. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Atari 7800 also had a Basketball Game that came out in 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It was a port of the Computer game "One on One...", which featured actual basketball players and -- but still wasn't nearly as impressive as this. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One really important thing about Sports Games in general is the controls. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This game just handles really well. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, I had some complaints of the C.P.U. version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But in the 2-Player version, these weren't really issues at all and I think that was, sort of, the main attraction of the game anyway. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And something else "Double Dribble" had: a really cool little halftime show (in which a confused looking frog chases after a giant phallic object). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, compare this to the horribly ugly halftime show in the Master System's "Great Basketball". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not that I wanna harp on the Master System's inferiority to the, uh, FamiCom or N.E.S. here (I do enough of that in 'Chronsega') but Sega's game looks [pretty] feeble next to this. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, I do have one complaint. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It actually can be [pretty] difficult to pick out which player you are currently in control of sometimes. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade game gave him like a nice red aura. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here he does, sort of, slightly flickers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's a lot more subtle, and it's [pretty] easy to lose track in the excitement (especially when there are a lot of players all, sort of, on top of each other and the sprite flicker kicks in). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I assume this is mostly due to the FamiComs graphic limitations. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There certainly were times [when I was sort of trying to] control, uh -- switch control of the player that I had, and I couldn't really tell which player I had activated. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, among basketball video games of the 8-bit era and Sports Games in general this period, "Double Dribble" is really top-notch. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Cleopatra no Mahou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Square 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by DOG 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, here we are halfway thorough "...Episode 20" and we now come to "Cleopatra no Mahou" (or 'Magical Treasures of Cleopatra'), another game published by D.O.G. and developed by Square, themselves. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As we seen, Square's earlier releases haven't exactly been spectacular and "Cleopatra..." is no exception. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But this is notable as being the first R.P.G. (or quasi-R.P.G.) Square developed for the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also notable are the fact that in the credit are graphics by Takashi Tokita (who later directed "Chrono Trigger") and music by Nobuo Uematsu. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, fans of Square should note, this isn't really their first R.P.G. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That would be "Cruise [Chaser] Blassty", released in 1986 for the P.C.-88, which is a surprisingly complicated game, featuring lots of, uh, character, uh, customization allowing you multiple actions per turn. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This little bit gives it almost, sort of, like a proto-Tactical R.P.G. feel. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be very good. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You spend a lot of time flying around in space looking for random enemy encounters. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And battles are [pretty] darn long, but the game looks really, really cool. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Cleopatra...", on the other hand, is much more like a Japanese Adventure Game with R.P. battles uncomfortably shoehorned in. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It looks very similar to the earlier "Suishou no Ryu" with, uh, 'Move', 'Look', 'Take', et cetera commands, in the menu, there. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You also have a 'Status' command, which shows you your Hit Points, Experience Points, and Money. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here, I'm going to actually buy a weapon. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You start off with a weapon that you can buy the dagger for 100 pieces of Gold. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... What's missing are any other stats (such as like your Level, Attack, Defense - that kind of stuff). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In typical old-school fashion (just like the first "Deep Dungeon" game) gaining more experience will [only] increase your Hit Points. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Increasing your attack or defense can [only] be done by buying weapons and armor. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And there aren't exactly a whole lot of weapons and armor in this game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now one thing about "Cleopatra..." is extremely boring and unbalanced. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You start off roaming around town killing enemies and getting experience in Gold. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's [pretty] typical of R.P.G.s, but the entire town is literally eight screens. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Four of them are shop fronts (like this one scene here) and the other four are basically the alleys between the shops. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You move just like in "Sui Shu". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You, uh, select the Move option from the menu and point the arrow which direction you wanna move and then hit the button again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This makes moving around a bit slower than in most m... -- other R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you will spend the first chunk of the game going around in circles over the same eight screens, fighting battles, going to the inn, and then repeating - trying to get enough Gold, uh, to buy the map you need to get to the next area. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Easier said than done. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The inn is expensive (uh, 50 Gold pieces as a matter of fact) and the enemies don't exactly drop much Gold. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And at one point an enemy stole about half my Gold. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, it actually took me quite a while before I made much headway. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I've entered the inn, here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing I will say: This game does have some rather ugly character graphics. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I love the fact that they're called cashiers and appear to have what looks like a modern-style cash register. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of the, uh, three enemies you'll find in this, uh, first area. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess they were kind of nicely animated, but, uh, really nothing spectacular. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This first part of the game really is incredibly grindy. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it's -- it's much worse than, say, the first "Dragon Warrior" (mostly because you're just, sort of, seeing these same little, uh, alleyways over and over and over again). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes you might spend a minute or two just, sort of, wandering around the town in circles, looking for an enemy. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now eventually, once you've, uh, bought the map, you can head out to the Sphinx, find a hidden door, and then get some standard, uh, Adventure Game sequences. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 First, you've got to find the hidden door by pointing to it, using your, uh -- your 'Look' arrow. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There it is. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And once inside, of course, you can look at the items, pick them up, try to use them in various ways - it's just, sort of, the standard, you know, attach item A to item B, {and} so on {and} so forth. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There really already [only] are a couple different screens of -- of this sort of thing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, you, sort of, pick up the various objects. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And then later you have to insert the onyx into some holes down in the wall. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That red jewel you have to put into the missing eye socket of the statue. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Really nothing too challenging or exciting, here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, once you find this tower, you'll move on, uh, to, sort of, next few screens of fighting enemies. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, unfortunately, there is really not much of a transition in enemy difficulty. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The town you were in earlier has enemies that usually can hit you for up to about 10 points of damage. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, in the tower, the enemies will often go up to 80 points of damage. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, once again, there are [only] a few types of enemies in each area. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As I think I mentioned, there about three and a town and maybe four in this tower (not counting the bosses that you find in the room). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And unfortunately, the, uh, battles in this are extremely mechanical. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's no magic or items that can be used in battle. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And there aren't any, like, you know, virtual dice rolls when it comes to dealing damage. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 A certain enemy will always do the exact same amount of damage every time it hits you. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, the scorpions: 🍇
🟥🍪🍋🍓 When they hit you, they will always do exactly that amount of damage, right there. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Same thing when you hit them: 🍇
🟥🍪🍋🍓 Depending on what weapon you have, you'll always do the same amount of damage; it doesn't matter how high you've actually Leveled Up. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And there are boss-like enemies, but de... -- defeating them really requires no strategy. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's simply a matter of, uh, 'Is my Hit Points high enough to withstand five hits from the boss if each hit takes 300 damage?'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you know, I did find "Cleopatra..." [pretty] intriguing, uh, just because it does everything so poorly. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, certainly Square helped popularize the console R.P.G. in Japan and in the West and became, uh, known primarily as a publisher of R.P.G.s, yet this game is just so awful! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's really odd to think this came out [only] a few months before "Final Fantasy". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One helpful thing: 🍇
🟥🍪🍋🍓 It does allow you to 'Run' from battles. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (And you'll *need* to do this frequently if you get low on Hit Points, because, well, you know, the inn is actually in the town.) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There is a healing room inside the tower, but it's [pretty] expensive (uh, 250 Gold). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, often you find yourself, sort of, going to the tower, fighting a few enemy battles, going back down to the bottom, going to town, healing, going back to the tower. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the loading screens and, sort of, slow movement make this much more tiresome than it should be. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of the bosses right here - uh, sort of, an Indian-style snake. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This game in theory has a, uh, Egyptian theme, but... I'm not so sure about those snakes. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, "Cleopatra...", I guess the whole kind of Adventure Game<SLASH::/>R.P.G. was, uh, certainly an interesting idea but, all in all, I'd say it definitely does not work. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Titanic Mystery: Ao No Senritsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Oxford Digital | Gakken 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Gakken 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, it's the third F.D.S. game released on July 24th and it's a *weird* one, "Titanic Mystery: Ao No Senritsu" (which, rather poetically, means 'melody of blue'). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 First of all, just look at how much this intro looks like that of the Sega Master System's "Rocky" (which we saw back in "Chronsega Episode 3"). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, this is a rather unusual Strategy Adventure Game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it's actually a port of a Commodore 64 release, originally developed by a little company called Oxford Digital Enterprises. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I think they are British. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game was released by Activision. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (This is the old version, here.) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You may have noticed their copyright on the title screen. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It was released as "Raise the Titanic" around 1986. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Electric-Dreams (a publisher that put out a lot of Activision's titles in Europe) was apparently going to release it over there under the title "RMS Titanic", but I guess the release was cancelled. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, the object is to, uh, "raise the Titanic". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Most of the game takes place in the control room using a little, sort of, remote-controlled robotic drone to explore the ship. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] cool graphics! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's sort of, like, a neat -- night vision effect on the monitor while you're exploring, uh, the interior of the Titanic. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also, you need to keep track of your money, uh, deal with financeers, and even hold press conferences concerning the mission. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This, right here, is the room where you talk with various bankers. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, how exactly this ended up getting turned into a FamiCom game is anyone's guess. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Since this is a Japanese game, of course, some sex appeal was added. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You now control a perpetually swimsuit and headband-clad young lady. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (She looks more like an aerobics instructor than a scuba diver.) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And you spend a lot of time looking at her oddly-shaped hindquarters. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are actually two games this episode which focus a lot on ass shots, for some reason. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The graphics now look a lot more, uh, Nintendo-y. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And you now, sort of, control your character directly, uh, by entering rooms, rather than simply navigating menus. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The publisher, by the way, was Gakken, a huge Japanese educational publisher. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (They do tons of magazines, textbooks, and so on.) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You may recall we've seen a few other print publishers like Tokuma Shoten start releasing FamiCom games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Gakken briefly got to the video game racket, but I don't think they really released too much of interest. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here's the, uh, press conference sections, here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting, a lot of the, uh, U.S. video game (or rather U.S. Computer games) at this time (like the various you know, Strategy-type games and so on) um, didn't really have you controlling an on-screen representation of your character. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In Japan (in both Arcade and console games) it seemed much more important to have a visible sprite (be it like a spaceship, or a person, or whatever), sort of, represent the player. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The "Portopia"-style Adventure Games was one exception. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, in "Titanic Mystery..." you now control the diver directly, and you can explore the ship in like the more standard, you know, FamiCom video game-style fashion. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, this is an interesting little historical oddity - one that seems to have fallen through the cracks, uh, like a few games this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Karaoke Studio 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As I'm sure you figure it out from the cover artists a second ago, this is a karaoke game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Awesome. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I can't believe it took four years for someone to come out with a karaoke game for the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, there's a built in microphone on the controller. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Although "Karaoke Studio" comes with a special microphone attachment.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so you plug in, select your song, and then start singing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And cute little animations play during the songs - some of which are quite charming (though, not really this one). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The songs are mostly standard-issue kiddy stuff. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I don't think there are any licensed pop songs on this thing. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The developer is that old Bandai standby, Tose, and I guess they do a [pretty] good job, here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One of the other cute ones is where the, uh, police officer dog leads around the lost kitten. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess that we would not, strictly speaking, call this a game, I guess it's more like a toy. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You might find it to be a bit amusing, I suppose. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, that, uh, karaoke is and was still very popular in Japan. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One of the options is where you can actually sing before a crowd. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And this is great. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You're accompanied by just one guy, who's playing with Tubular Bells. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's another option where you, sort of, sing before some kind of a panel of talent judges or something like that. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, "Karaoke Studio" isn't exactly a candidate for something that you want to play. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But it's worth noting that Bandai is becoming an advocate of what we might call 'casual gaming', what with their 'Family Trainer' games and stuff like this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 These weren't really aimed at a gamer audience. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Instead, they were aimed at, sort of, you know, regular folks - who might not normally play video games. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess, uh, when you think about it, Nintendo (the Nintendo of today) really owes them a [pretty] big conceptual debt for this kind of stuff. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and Bandai did release a couple add-ons to this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 These are just carts that contain more songs. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One will come out later in the year, then one will come out in early 1988. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Chester Field: Ankoku Shin e no Chosen 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by VIC TOKAI 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by VIC TOKAI 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sandwiched between two Bandai games is Vic Tokai's "Chester Field...". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For those who don't recall, Vic Tokai is an enormous Japanese cable and telecom company, started making video games in the mid-1980s. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is their second FamiCom game (the first being 1986's "Aighina no Yogen..."). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, I will admit with a name like "Chester Field...", I assumed this was going to be some sort of detective Adventure Game, featuring some Raymond Chandler-esque hardboiled chain-smoking detective. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But nope, just like "Aighina no Yogen...", it's a Fantasy-themed Action Game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I do love that hilariously protracted opening title scroll. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In true 1980s video game fashion, it, sort of, tacks on overly complicated plot and backstory, introducing all these characters who we have no idea who they are and none of this really has much bearing on the game, itself. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, it turns out Chester Field is not a person, but rather a medieval fantasy island that this game takes place on. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Does this looks sort of familiar? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah! Last episode, this was called "Zombie Hunter". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, this is perhaps a bit better than "Zombie Hunter". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, definitely, this game doesn't pull any punches. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Right away it, sort of, puts you into the first dungeon (which we saw there a moment ago). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But it's, uh, maybe better not to tackle that dungeon right away. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, this is, uh, back in a time when video game genres maybe weren't quite so defined. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You might consider this to be a side-scrolling Action R.P.G., or maybe a Hack-'n'-Slash Platformer with R.P.G. elements, or maybe just a clone of "Zelda II..." with the overworld sequences removed. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here, of course, is one of the many shops we find. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, a lot of these sell one item [only]. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And here is the first boss - looks kind of like the thing from the 'Alien' movies. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's a typical, sort of, 'jump up, hit him in the head, and then back away' sort of boss. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Now, what exactly', may you ask, 'is the difference between this game and say, "Getsufuu Maden"?'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, aside from "Chester [Field]"'s lack of anything aesthetically pleasing and its extreme linearity, it's the combat. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Fighting monsters in "Chester Field...", especially bosses is just not cool. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Your character is slow, he jumps funny, and most [annoyingly] *freezes* when he takes a hit. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you get hit while jumping, you're character, sort of, stop in the midair for a second and then continue along the arc of jump. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Boss battles are hard - not due to the bosses being unpredictable or anything, but just because, uh, your character is, sort of, hard to control. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 When you're fighting regular monsters, they tend to drop, uh, (get this) Gold or health refills. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 How original! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Kill enough monsters and you'll eventually, uh, Level Up and Gold can buy things in the shops or you can go into an inn and restore your health. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... [For some] reason almost all the shops and inns are owned by cute girls. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though, of course, the guys who give you advice are your typical, you know, old bearded dudes. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing that's a little strange is your character's speed is very eccentric. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It seems his general walking speed tends to increase or decrease from time to time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I assume this is a technical glitch of some sort, but, uh, certainly is annoying. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Chester Field..." has something in common with Square's "Cleopatra..." game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It doesn't really seem to understand the appeals of stats and levels in R.P.G.s. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In "Dragon Quest", for example, uh, seeing your L... -- your Level go up and being informed of your Strength or Endurance or whatever increasing triggers some sort of, like, [Pavlovian] instinct in gamers to, sort of, get all excited [and feel] a [sense of] accomplishment. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here (while you do technically get stronger and get better weapons) you don't really ever feel a sense of progress. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... Part of it, maybe you can [only] increase your levels so many times, um, in each section of the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This gives improving your character, sort of, a predetermined feel to it, rather than something you actually control. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess I shouldn't be too hard on "Chester Field...". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It certainly is better than "Zombie Hunter" and some people may even get a bit -- a certain amount of enjoyment out of it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Trainer: Meiro Daisakusen 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 31 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alright, it's official. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm really starting to get tired of Bandai's 'Family Trainer' games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 While we've [only] had a few Power Pad games in the U.S., Bandai put out a whole bunch in Japan (like this one). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Meiro Daisakusen" (which means something like "Maze: Great Mission"). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And damn! There's that stupid dinosaur from the "Pocket Zaurus..." game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Most of the previous 'Family Trainer' releases had some sort of athletic theme. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "...Meiro Daisakusen" breakes the mood by putting you in an Adventure Game set in a 3D labyrinth. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess there is even some sort of *plot* involved. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, 'Family Trainer' has moved from its purpose of providing exercise to lazy middle class brats to simply being a regular video game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Granted, one where you have to walk around on the pad instead of just using your controller.) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's not really that great of an idea. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There has been a bit of an adjustment made to the standard 'Family Trainer' controller scheme; you now have to turn corners in this game! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Earlier games mostly just had you walking or running straight forward. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, this title certainly isn't very good. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, there is, however, some good news. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Namely, that this being the fifth title in the 'Family Trainer' series, we are now halfway done. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Monty no Doki Doki Daisassou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 31 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Gremlin | Jaleco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's "Monty no Doki Doki Daisassou" (or, as the title screen also says, "Monty on the Run") - another oddball title here, folks, as we shall see in just a moment. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] cool music but observe a copyright to Gremlin Graphics, the U.K.-based computer game company, who released a lot of, sort of, lousy games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Monty on the Run" was one of their biggest hits (originally released for the C64 and a few other computers in 1985 - though the copyright says 1986, so who knows?) the sequel to 1984's "Wanted: Monty Mole". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This C64 version is known for having some great, great music by Ron Hubbard (some of the best for the system!). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also known for being insanely hard, mostly due to the terrible pre-"Super Mario Bros." style jumping controls. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, Jaleco apparently obtained the Japanese rights and released this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, first of all, note at the beginning here you have to choose two objects to take with you. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Among them are weapons and various helpful items. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's the thing: 🍇
🟥🍪🍋🍓 This has virtually nothing to do with the original game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, Monty is no longer a mole; he's now a human. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, rather than trying to hop a ship across the English Channel and escape to the continent, Monty is now, *I think*, trying to prove he did not commit the crime of which he was [accused]. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is done by collecting various pieces of a photo of the real criminal - which are scattered throughout the various undergrounds, temples, and caverns, and whatnot. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And again, let me stress this fact; virtually everything has been changed for the FamiCom version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And by that I mean the levels, the enemies, really the entire idea. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If we were to play this without knowing what [it] was called, you would really have no idea that was supposedly based on "Monty on the Run". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, there are a few things have been borrowed from the original. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, your character jumps by doing a little midair flip, or the rising and falling columns that you'll need to slip under. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess the general idea is, sort of, hopping around from platform to platform. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are a few things taken directly from the game (like the elevators that kill you when you get into them); that's very nice. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And also watch out for the *teleporters* that will warp you back to the beginning of the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Jaleco, you bastards! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, while this is not nearly as impossible as a C64 game, it can be a bit cruel. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 All the items and keys you need to find are hidden, usually in ordinary-looking blocks. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Or they just, sort of, appear you know when you, uh, enter a certain area. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We've seen this in many games before. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... But while "Super Pitfall", for example, it rendered the game virtually unplayable, and it's a lot more manageable, here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And while the levels have various booby traps and dead ends and whatnot, "Monty..." is really not an exercise in torturing the player the way "Dragon Slayer IV..." is. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, some rather unfair curveballs were thrown at ya. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here I found the final boss of the first level, but I don't have enough ammo to kill him. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The gun [only] comes with 10 bullets and refill ammo is [pretty] scarce. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I was actually conserving my ammo, but still after emptying the gun at him, he still has some health left. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess I'm screwed. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's nothing I can do. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, the secret you actually have to choose the right items at the beginning of a level, such as the Morningstar (which does not require ammo) and the oxygen tanks (uh, so you don't die while swimming). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Of course, you have to choose the items before you know which ones are necessary to complete the level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Without the oxygen you will lose, like, a lot of health crossing the various bodies of water. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And with the infinite use of the Morningstar, you can like seriously punch that money. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here is a good example of one of the water tanks which, uh, will probably kill you if you try without the oxygen tanks. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the weird thing is despite all various flaws and somewhat funky controls (like the way he, sort of, spazzes out when he jumps when there's something right above his head) um, I actually [pretty] much like this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's definitely not the same league as "Metroid". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But compared to most other games in the, uh, 'Explore Caverns and Find Items While Killing Monsters' genre, such as "Super Pitfall" or "...Wing of Madoola" or "Nazo no Atlantis" this game is actually very respectable. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The mystery is why Jaleco licensed the 'Monty' name and then made an entirely new game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, some changes would need to be made to make the game palatable to console gamers in 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But if they were going to start from square one, why bother buying the rights? 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Developer Mini-Biographies ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Before we get into our next game, "Slalom", I'd like to introduce a new feature to 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, we'll take a look at a game developer or publisher in more detail - sort of, a mini company bio. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 A Brief History of Rare ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Since "Slalom" is the first N.E.S. game from the British developer, Rare, we'll go ahead and take a few minutes and [delve] into the history of this famous (and sometimes infamous) company. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Intro: The Stampers Found Ultimate Play The Game ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 To begin with, Rare was formed in 1982 by Tim and Chris Stamper in Leicestershire County, smack dab in the middle of England in a quiet little town of Ashby de la Zouch. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Of course, they didn't call themselves Rare back then. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Of course, not. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They named their company Ashby Computers and Graphics. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And in the fine British tradition of giving video game companies really awkward names, they released their titles under the name 'Ultimate Play The Game'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 At the time, the popular computer in England was Sinclair's ZX Spectrum, a graphical powerhouse. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The higher-end model packed a whopping 48K of RAM and could display up to three colors on the screen at one time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Okay, well, could actually display seven colors at once. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But for various technical reasons, you couldn't really put two colors next to each other unless one of those colors was black.) 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸JetPac ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ultimate's first game was 1983 "JetPac", an Arcade-style game in which your jetpack-equipped astronaut attempts to assemble the pieces of his rocket ship while under constant attack from alien forces. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game was a huge smash success in the U.K., selling almost 1,000 copies. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, alright, it actually sold around 300,000 so it really was quite a big hit. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Cookie ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ultimate continued to make similar games at the rate of around six a year. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And all work successful, such as "Cookie" (also from 1983) where are you play chef trying to land the proper ingredients into your mixing bowl. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Atic Atac ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Atic Atac" was much more ambitious, featuring a multiple room castle, which you must explore in order to find some sort of Golden key. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The basic gameplay idea (cruising around interconnected screens looking for objects) I suppose that genre originated with Atari's "Adventure" from 1979. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This basic gameplay idea formed the basis for most of Rare's later Spectrum games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Sabre Wulf ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In 1984, uh, that was a banner year for Ultimate, uh, starting with "Sabre Wulf", which started the tradition of misspelled words in their game titles. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 By this time, English game critics and fans were keeping massive amounts of adulation on the company. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The hard-working Stamper brothers reaped substantial fame and fortune as a result. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Knight Lore ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Even more widely praised was "Knight Lore" (which, as far as I can Intel, contains no knights). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This was the first Rare game to employ isometric perspective using the 'filmation' graphics engine. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This actually kicked off a brief mania for isometric games in the U.K., and caused British gamers to work themselves into an incredible frenzy. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, nowadays, "Knight Lore" might seem, sort of, like a rather simple (though decent-looking) Adventure Game with wonky controls. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Many ZX fans consider it to be like the Sistine Chapel of video game design. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One rather amazing quote I came across on Wikipedia was from the U.K. game magazine, 'Edge', which called it, <QUOTE::">the single greatest advance in the history of Computer games"<END QUOTE::">. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess whatever you say. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Rare's Quality Packaging ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing about Rare, was they did have quality packaging with very cool illustrations in all their games (sort of like the British equivalent of Electronic Arts). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 While the games contained no in-game storyline, the packaging usually detailed the plot in Rare's distinctive (though hilariously overwrought) style. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, from the box of "Knight Lore": 

🟥🍪🍋🍓 "...Behind me I feel the night's dark icy fingers slither up long looming shadows, hiding behind large mounds and boulders, watching my every move... silently waiting... 🍇

🟥🍪🍋🍓 For days I have journeyed from the realms of the jungle wulf to 'KNIGHT LORE' castle to seek the old dying wizard...", et cetera, et cetera. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess to really appreciate that you, sort of, have to read that in a Richard Burton style voice. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Pentagram ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This game is "Pentagram" from 1985 - another title in the "Knight Lore"-style. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, the FamiCom port of "Knight Lore" covered in "Chrontendo Episode 13" more resembles this game than the original "Knight Lore". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# The Stampers Found Rare ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, at this point, the first stage in Rare's career comes to an end. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Surprisingly, after a brief attempt at branching out to the Commodore 64, the Stamper brothers sold the name Ultimate Play The Game and stopped making Computer games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They decided the future was with console games and turned their attention towards Nintendo. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Slalom ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In 1986, after having studied the inner workings of the FamiCom, they created "Slalom", the game in question this episode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo released this game themselves, and from this point onward the newly named Rare would release games almost exclusively for Nintendo machines. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸R.C. Pro-Am ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One of their earlier Nintendo Entertainment System hits was "R.C. Pro-Am" from 1988. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This remote controlled Racing Game uses Rare's now beloved isometric perspective - a cool game but Rare has changed up their business strategy completely. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Hollywood Squares ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Rather than presenting themselves as a prestige developer, Rare now did quick and dirty work for anyone and everyone. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Taboo: The Sixth Sense ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the late 1980s and early '90s, we saw them turn out tons of ports and awful license games the likes of s----meisters, like L.J.N., Acclaim, Mattel, and GameTek. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸A Nightmare on Elm Street ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Stampers had gone from being kings of the U.K. computer game scene to reliable guns for hire for the American console scene. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Battletoads ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, they would occasionally turn out interesting product like 1991's "Battletoads" (which in typical Rare fashion is weird, combining technically impressive stuff with lots of glitchyness). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's also impossibly difficult - to the point where opinions are divided as to whether it's a classic or a barely playable disaster. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Rare as a Nintendo Second-Party Developer ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Donkey Kong Country ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But all of this changed completely in 1994 when Rareware became a second-party developer for Nintendo, and released "Donkey Kong Country" for the Super Nintendo. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Aside from reviving the long-dead 'Donkey Kong' franchise, Rare impressed everyone with its revolutionary graphics, replacing boring old hand-drawn sprites for pre-rendered 3D models. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game was enormously successful, sold tons of copies, and won lots of praise at the time. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nowadays, however, the "Donkey Kong Country"'s luster has faded and a number of folks consider it to be a [pretty] lackluster Platformer with [pretty] graphics. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, Rare now found themselves a very hot commodity. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Donkey Kong Country 3 ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, once again, they were a prestige developer, slowly releasing a series of well-crafted big-name games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Donkey Kong Country 2 [mentioned, not seen] ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Donkey Kong..." sequels came out in 1995 and 1996. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸GoldenEye 007 ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But in 1997, Rareware reached the pinnacle of their career with the release of "GoldenEye 007" for Nintendo. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This Nintendo 64 title helped bring full 3D First-Person Shooters to consoles and sold about 8 million copies - outselling even "...Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time", and it remains one of the best-loved video games of all time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "GoldenEye..." managed it to be technically impressive and still play exceptionally well - a huge triumph for Rare and one that would be very difficult to duplicate. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Perfect Dark ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But they somehow almost pulled it off with 2000s "Perfect Dark", published by Rare, themselves. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If anything, "Perfect Dark" was an even better game than "GoldenEye..." and was also a [pretty] sizable hit. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Donkey Kong 64 [mentioned, not seen] ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Rare also developed [pretty] popular in 64 games like "Donkey Kong 64". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Banjo Kazooie series [mentioned, not seen] ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the 'Banjo-Kazooie' games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Rare Joins Microsoft Games Studios ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, being Nintendo's biggest second-party developer, everyone was rather surprised when in 2002, Microsoft announced they had purchased Rare for the staggering and record-breaking sum of <three hundred and seventy five million dollars::$375 million>. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, at this point, the party was [pretty] much over. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Rare had been slowly losing employees since the release of "GoldenEye...". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Grabbed by the Ghoulies ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And Rare's first game for Microsoft's Xbox console, "Grabbed by the Ghoulies", was a huge disappointment - both in terms of quality and sales. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Perfect Dark Zero ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Even worse, Rare's later games for Microsoft really failed to attract much attention. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Perfect Dark Zero" sold a fraction of its predecessor. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Kameo: Elements of Power ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And "Kameo..." (originally planned for the GameCube) also failed to find much of a fan base. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Viva Piñata ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Probably Rare's [only] successful franchise for Xbox is the 'Viva Pinata' series. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# The Stampers Leave Rare ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And in 2007 the Stamper brothers themselves jumped ship - leaving Microsoft holding a $375 million bag. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Suckers!) 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Conclusion: Back to Slalom ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But now let's rewind to October 1987 and "Slalom". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Slalom 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And with no further ado, here is "Slalom", Rare's first N.E.S. game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This was not released for the FamiCom in Japan. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Most of Rare's titles ended up being for the U.S. or European market (which makes sense, I suppose, since they're really more tuned to the wants of the Western audiences). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Slalom" is obviously a skiing game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Upon loading you'll find you'll choose your mountain. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Snowy Hill is the easiest; Mount Nasty is the hardest. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Each mountain has several courses. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, before being released for the N.E.S., "Slalom" hit the arcades, supposedly in November 1986 as "VS. Slalom". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The 'Nintendo VS....' Arcade machines were based on the N.E.S. hardware. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Though the game is gruff and a little different than the home versions, you can see the, uh, colors are a little bit off, here.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade cabinet actually had these silly skis and ski poles built in so you felt like you're actually skiing (or maybe not). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, a number of popular N.E.S. titles were released for the arcades in the 'Vs.' format. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you were to do a side-by-side comparison, you'd see very slight graphical differences between the two versions, but for all [intents and] purposes there are virtually indistinguishable. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You begin each slope with this qualifying time trial, and then you can move on to the real slopes. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are other skiers but, like a number of Racing Game for this era, the object isn't so much to beat the competition than it is across the finish line before the time runs out. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have to avoid trees, snowmen, other skiers, and, uh, the actual slalom markers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can execute little jumps and stuff but, as you may have seen a moment ago, I didn't actually do any. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And in what I suppose is, sort of, a typical British humor your character's butt cheeks are very prominently placed and unusually well detailed. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, how's the game play? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Slalom" looks great; I'll give it that. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Its, uh, sprite-based 3D effects are very convincing! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The sprites become more detailed as they get closer to ya, and everything whizzes by very smoothly. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Slalom" doesn't really look nearly as spastic as Nintendo's own "Mach Rider" from 1985, for example. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And here we come to the crux of many of Rare's games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Technically, it's very impressive, but in terms of play, "Slalom" is not so good. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 With Racing Games, you really control the track more than vehicle, itself. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In "OutRun", for example, the vehicle [only] tilts very slightly to the left or right, while the road moves beneath you. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have very precise control over the road - and where your vehicle is on the road. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can, sort of, very smoothly follow the outside curve of the road, for example. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 With "Slalom", hitting the D-Pad will cause your skier to, sort of, turn at a 45-degree angle. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Control is very imprecise. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You're basically going either straight forward, to the right 45 degrees, or to the left 45 degrees. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This gives the controls a much more digital feel, rather than a smooth analog feel. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can't really make smooth turns the way you can most Racing Games and the characters motion seemed very jerky. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, really "Slalom" feels like a Racing Game with very bad controls. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I was [pretty] much constantly fighting the controls on this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Swerving to avoid obstacles and then straightening out to pass between the markers is way clumsier than it should be. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I can [only] assume this was due to technical limitations. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [What] with all the obstacles on the path coming towards you, it would have -- make it be much easier to make most of the motion come from the skier, rather than from the background. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But I really feel the controls could have been a lot better implemented. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, "Slalom" is a bit of a landmark game but still not a very good one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mahjong Kazoku 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 04 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Irem 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Here's our final game this episode - perhaps a bit of a letdown. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You see, this is a Mahjong game (from Irem!) but licensed from Ox Incorporated. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Who the heck are Ox Incorporated? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Is this game a port? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I couldn't find any Arcade version of this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps some obscure Japanese Computer game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I really wish that I knew. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I suppose that if anyone has any ideas about this, let me know. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really going to spend too much time on all these Mahjong games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 These episodes are long enough as it is. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And probably it's best not to focus too heavily on a genre that doesn't interest very many folks. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 On a purely stick superficial level, most of these games look the same. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Undoubtedly, Mahjong enthusiasts would pick up on the subtle gameplay variations (and Mahjong has many of those). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, for most folks, it will be enough to say that this is a one-on-one version of Mahjong - often found in video games. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In real life, Mahjong is played by four people (or three in one particular variant). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, well, like a lot of gambling games it gets simplified when converted to video game form. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, the title means 'Mahjong Family' and Namco released "Family Mahjong" about one week later. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We'll see that next episode. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For now, let me just leave you with the fact that this is actually, sort of, the, uh, beginning of a whole bunch of Mahjong games coming out for the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's going to become a very ubiquitous genre in Japanese video games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 20 Wrap Up ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Thank you very much for watching "Chrontendo Episode 20". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, guess what's going on next time? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's right! More Mahjong games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Okay, actually [only] one.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But what we do have that's cool are the debuts of two franchises that some of you discriminating gamers might be familiar with. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also, games from Konami! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's right! Three big games from Konami. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, next episode is virtually like the Konami blowout episode. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, we'll see you then. 🍇🍌
