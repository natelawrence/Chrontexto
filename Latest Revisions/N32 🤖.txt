👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 32 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Add last "...Episode 32", which covers the end of May through mid July 1988. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Only] 12 games this time because we've got the last two parts of the massive "History of Adventure Games". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Speaking of which, we have a weird Adventure Game from Konami, some oddball games from serious Westerner, and finally some high-quality stuff from Sunsoft. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's get going. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ninja Kun Ashura no Shou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 May 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by UPL | Micronics 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by UPL 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, we'll start off with the final game of Maine 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, it's "ninja con assura no show" from a UPL. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ninja-kun..." remember him? Cute little ninja guy? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is what the fourth game with ninja couldn't it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, there'll be plenty more. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, first things first. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first game was based on a UPL Arcade Game and was released for the PAM con by Jaleco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Jaleco spawn off its own series of original titles under the name Ninja jamberoo, was supposedly ninja Koons little brother. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then in 1987, UPL suddenly put on Arcade sequel to the first game (perhaps inspired by the success of the jello games). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was known as "ninja kid two" or even better, the wonderfully at sounding title "rad action". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's basically an updated version of ninja code with a few bells and whistles added (nothing too exciting - a couple of new kinds of levels and some incredibly psychedelic graphics). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now UPL has ported this to the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because the quality is important, They hired the very best (Micronics) to program the FamiCom version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And man is this thing ugly! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just goes to show everything Micronics gets their hands on they turn into a huge mess. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, this game has some sort of like branching path feature where you can select which level you actually want to start at beginning of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object here is still to kill all the enemies on screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can stun them by jumping at them or kill them Yeah, [pretty] sure throwing stars are one of the power-ups that you get. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your Kagan was [pretty] old-fashioned by 97 standards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Now there's nothing wrong with that.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But those mean it plays more like a game from few years back,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, feels kind of out of place will be R.P.G.s and Run-'n'-Guns coming out in the hammock. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there aren't some very irritating moments. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have this bonus like level we're in perform some rapid button mashing To climb up a wall,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, it's too easy to fall off-the-wall. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when you do, you'll land on the exit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you'll be asked if you want to quit the level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it's so idiotic, it's so easy to fall off-the-wall and you keep landing on that door and then having talked to this guy over and over again,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Isn't always gonna land on it when you fall Why don't move it over? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It just completely bizarre level design, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We want to do finally make this, you get a boomerang weapon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you didn't get the not so psychedelic congratulations screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So rather a bit less exciting than the Arcade version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now it turns out this was going to be released in the U.S. by American Sami under the name ninja Tarot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually listed in 'Nintendo Power' as having the spring 1988 release date. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But wouldn't have looked too impressive Next, "Mega Man 2", "Strider", and "Super Dodgeball". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The release was canceled, but 1991 semi-release a game for the Game Boy called tutorial. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But turns out this is a completely different game like "...Zelda" clone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess things guitar was too good not to use. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, "Ninja coup assura no show" not a terrible terrible game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the original Arcade Game was not that exciting and the demo comport is really not even as good as that. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Saint Seiya 2 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 May 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the last game of may 19, eight is "st say a to" (Well, that's what GameFAQs calls it) from Bandai and Tose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really MF Series was from Tony. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we should be grateful that Bandai made the game, as opposed to totally using choice system 2.0 same set game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the money saving tip for a video game developers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When making a sale. Use the exact same intro and Opening Music as the first game; Just add a new title screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually music does sound maybe just a little bit better. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright so anyway, can't remember what st say is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well can't say blame yet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's about these kids who are raised be super warriors called saints. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Have this, sort of, special Greek mythology powers and predict the goddess Athena. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally has something to do with some gods and then stuff happens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, they're these magical bronze armor called claws. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes clauses the official word for the armors so don't blame the translators of this game. That sound weird. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And yes is a fine translation from the same folks who translated "GeGeGe no Kitaro to" cover the translation cannot save this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it looks kind of boring, huh? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Punch the bad guys who just, sort of, wander around randomly, jump and land on you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Walk right into the bottomless pits that are all over the place. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game alternates between these little side-scrolling sequences with menu-based boss battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Menu-based?', you say. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why, yes! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Would it surprise you to learn that there are R.P.G. elements in St seya to? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It wouldn't? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well then I guess you are starting to get the hang of things. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy is all like 'oh no you didn't!'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Looks like a boss battle but actually it's not; you can't attack him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You just talk to him; and he'll fix your claws or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Many tiny scratches.". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently all this is based very closely on the animated series. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now we'll move on to Level 2. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A couple of things: at. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each level you can choose what character you want to play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As some are better than others against certain bosses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Have to meters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Cosmo (saw the drink or the magazine) it's like saints his version of force. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also have Health (human go around killing enemies and racking up seven cents which you can use to refill your cause mental health). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the saints are basically vampires who stay alive by consuming the life for so that people they murdered. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, by the way, that was Level 2. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Looks exactly like Level 1. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That also you can talk fighter switch characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Talking actually sometimes is required. So you have two different tacks,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is there a difference? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not like one does more consistent damage and the other as far as I can tell. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the thing: 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bosses do tons of damage. So when they attack you want to try to dodge using the left button. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know exactly if you have the mechanic works because sometimes I could dodge; other times and nothing seems to happen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I assume there's some sort of window of time but I don't see any on screen indication as to when you should try to dodge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe if you please game you'll have better luck than me. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when defeat this guy a little teeny tiny piece of horn falls off (very dramatic). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if you get this far and don't hate st say yet, we're going to hear - because it requires a lot of jumping and the jumping is terrible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have no control of the jump on midair. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes when you jump, you jump like way far Other times you jump like just one pixel forward. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really difficult to control you're going to fall to your death many many times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And oddly enough, you jump further from a standstill as opposed to being a running jump. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now I didn't really get too far in this game, namely because I couldn't get past this boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He hits you for like 50 damage every time he attacks but you want to do like 20 damage to him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And frequently my attacks would actually do no damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And dodging consistently is probably the key but I simply could not do that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No last because apparently this game is very repetitive and all the levels are, sort of, the same. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the R.P.G. elements don't really seem to like a mountain too much. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's basically just a Power Bar that you can fill up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's actually a lot less variety in this than the first game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you can probably safely skip this one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Cosmo Police Galivan 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 June 03 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nichibutsu 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nichibutsu 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We enter June with a very interesting game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Along with "Blaster Master" This is certainly the best game this episode, "Cosmo Police Galivan" from the Han Busan (a.k.a. Nichibutsu). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is one of those hidden Japanese gems you always hear about, which has been given a very helpful English fan translation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the backstory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sounds a lot like the plot of Halo, quite frankly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now before we get any further, let's play a little bit of background. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Who to kg gawin' was the first in a long-running series of Toei T.V. shows. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Originally ran back in nine tene 82. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] exciting stuff. As you can see,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The story is that Earth has been invaded by an evil alien Empire and this guy is going to save mankind or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Confusingly, the title is generally translated as space Sheriff Gavin. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, Nichibutsu gave this game the English title of "Cosmo Police Galivan". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game first appeared in arcades in 1985. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A typical "Ghosts 'n Goblins" type Platformer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Isn't the one with laser guns and space armored as power-ups is a [pretty] nasty looking name. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it doesn't really bear too much resemblance to the FamiCom game we're going to see today. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You always know they're a bad guy is when the internet so their headquarters is shaped like a dragon's head. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's one way you just margin there even without your metal armor on [only] with your beam blade, which I guess is like a lightsaber, a tiny short lightsaber. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the FamiCom version of "Cosmo Police Galivan" new tea boot suits I had to completely revamp it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like a metal droid style game with (you guessed it) R.P.G. elements. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, there's levels experience Hit Points Cosmo points (which are used when you fire Special Weapons) and GP. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Than what GP stands for (galavan points maybe?) But you get metal armor when it fills up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Metroid" II to collect various upgrades to make any progress. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First up is the hyper re, used open lock doors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That guy is Give it to me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Only] problem is when they try to fire it. Well we have no Cosmo points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So go ahead and randomly kill some enemies totally drop some cosmin points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It means always drop hp. CP or GP. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which one do they drop? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's based on the "...Zelda" rule. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whatever you already maxed out on or don't need that's what they'll drop (or at least that's what it feels like). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh also note every time you kill enemy you get one experience point who. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This factors in both your level and your weapons level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, this game makes it a lot Fill up your weapons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so finally got some CP there. So I'll use that hyper right to just open the door and then I'll enter a new area. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now those guys have laser guns or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You're also gonna need to destroy this like super computer in order to open some more doors. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're going to actually need to find another weapon and the metal blade. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And obtain the Cosmo power and feel a little bit total of three sub-bosses and one final boss - all in the first level. So it's actually a little confusing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to be very careful and avoid the computer projectiles because they'll knock off a huge chunk of their Hit Points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Galavan kind of reminds me of "Kid Icarus" and that you are, sort of, criminally underpowered If the game is beginning,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's sometimes possible to fight enemies without getting hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you get the causal power. You can use your beam to deflect their their shots that makes it load easier. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Take these guys, for example,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They fire an unblocked ball shot at your feet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Normally, you can try to jump over the shot, but he's under a platform and you can't jump. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And on the upper platform you'll take damage if your head hits the top. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you often need to, sort of, view the survival see points if you don't want to take damage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which reminds me of something that's true both "Metroid" and calligaris. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They gave you a ranged weapon, not this little tiny short lightsaber that takes like five hits to kill anything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, and Galvin has a bad case what tvtropes would call God damn bats,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they're much worse here than the bats and "Castlevania". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Castlevania", these bats take like six hits to kill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So even if you get in several good hits, they'll still fly right through you and cause some damage then turn around and hit you again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I officially declare galvanic bats (and the bats and bat Olympus) to be the worst video game bats I've seen so far. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Here's the first boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All the bosses take like a lot of hits to kill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These bosses try to wear you out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to, sort of, find their pattern and run up getting hit and do it over and over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I swear a normal ranged weapon, or a longer weapon would make a big difference. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if I had domotz whip, I could totally school these bosses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But in order to have any chances to killing enemies, you need to Level Up your weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, you see, every sword needs to be Leveled Up from grade c a grade A, and you have six words plus a final sword. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each new sword requires more experience to Level Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words that you need to grind in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, I'm doing it this particular spot, right here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I added up the total experience required to level all the swords up to their maximum and would be like a minimum of 4200 points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember, regular enemies dropped just one point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's no way you'd come even close to that playing the game through normally. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I guess you're, sort of, forced to grind. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Slowly Getting, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How to get 300 points level that one up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now "Cosmo Police Galivan" doesn't really go full "Metroid", meaning having one gigantic level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Notes broken down into six discrete levels,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Developers don't seem to want to take that step of making everything one gigantic level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game reminds me quite a bit of that crazy "Bio Senshi Dan" game from Atlas, But even more involved (maybe even a bit too involved). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, you have to collect new weapons, crystals, upgrades and et cetera At every single level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And levels aren't really huge. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Opening passages is sometimes a bit obscure; you have just like a crystal at some particular part of a new passage somewhere else in the level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again describing the computer will open up another passage somewhere in the level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you won't always know where the new opening is; is what appears out of nowhere. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not like anything like obvious like a blocked passage or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But despite all my bitching and complaining gubbins none usually will make game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean has high-quality Rapid school losses, great catchy music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I could really do without the experience grinding and the stupidity of the short weapon, but still highly recommended and one of the better games of this sort. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know why this was released in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other Nichibutsu games like "MagMax" came out over, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, definitely give this one a try. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Chou-Wakusei Senki MetaFight 🇯🇵 // Blaster Master 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 June 17 🇯🇵 // 1988 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sunsoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Chihuahua coos a sink a meta fight" (or 'super planetary war Chronicle meta fight') from Sunsoft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What's a meta fight? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's a fight about fighting I suppose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, this shot of a super space tank blasting off immediately identifies this game as "Blaster Master". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese version didn't have any, sort of, in-game Plot summary. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here in the U.S. we got a very spiffy new intro. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...Meta fight" uses the standard video game plot: 'evil alien invaders, it's up to you to defend your planet' (very same story in every single Shoot-'em-Up ever). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, in a fit of whimsy, Sunsoft decided to make "Blaster Master" about a guy who has a barrel of radioactive waste in his backyard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When his pet fraud escaped discovers a hidden tunnel to the underground world full of mutants. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So he hops in the nearby supertank to end the threat to mankind. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wait a second, where did the tank come from? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The manual just, sort of, glosses over the whole tank thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everyone says the tank is named 'Sopia the third', but neither the game nor the manual ever states this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The manual just calls it 'the vehicle'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Sophia the third' is the planet's name in the original game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Regardless, Sophia (or whatever she's called), is a [pretty] awesome tank - able to Fire left right are straight up and capable of jumping. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later you get all sorts of upgrades to Sofia. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see, "Blaster Master" is a "Metroid"-type game - one with tons of exploration backtracking, unlocking new passageways, the whole nine yards. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing I really like about this game is the way that the graphics are viewed like a wide angle view of the landscape. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's, sort of, like the camera has been pulled back a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like a side-scroller, in long shot rather than medium shot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is divided into two types of gameplay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's the side-scrolling tank sections and the top-down "...Zelda"-esque sections. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see do some more occasionally need to exit the vehicle to walk around on-foot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can't think of any other games that, uh, allow you to do this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, that's right, "Paris Dakar Rally Special". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, well "Master Blaster" is slightly better in that game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Specifically, you make your way through this little mazes, ships enemies and usually try to find like some special helpful items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Like that The flashing p will refill your power I just picked up some missiles for the tank). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each level has a few of these mazes but one in particular will actually have a boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Into the beat this boss to get an upgrade for your tank this guy is called 'Mother Brain'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess "Blaster Master" is not really shy about wearing influences on asleep. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Want you to feed him you'll get a more powerful tank cannon which allows you to blow but enemy blocking the way to Level 2. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There it is, right there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To then very conveniently warp back to the beginning of the maze. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can hop back in the tank and automatically install your upgrade. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Notice the hyper their. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Level 2 is a bit different; it, sort of, a castle thing Level - 1 full of lava pits and enemies that you can't hit with your cannon because they're too small (the shells just fly over their heads). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Because those things look like little gray caterpillar's). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah this game loves to throw difficult to hit enemies at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Good idea to stock up on homing missiles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the bonuses are all large and mostly [pretty] cool-looking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of them can be difficult and irritating. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, as much as I like "Blaster Master", it's not a perfect game and a few small problems do pop up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, there are sometimes enemies at the bottom of the screen that seemed to have turned invisible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually can't see these guys until you jump up legend or halfway about to DeLand, autumn,. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the top-down sections are often considered to be inferior to the tank sections, mostly because it's so difficult to hit enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The collision detection is very weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was firing point blank at that guy is now missing him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We often see bullets go right through enemy's head. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Same thing here are the bosses associated with a mouth his mouth is open. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the hitbox must be about one pixel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing is redshirting a hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Doesn't help that the grenades have incredibly short range and no splash damage at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Which doesn't really make much sense - I mean, they're grenades.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you're gonna display powered up, it's [pretty] powerful. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But here's the thing: When You take damage from enemy, not [only] do you lose light but you also lose gunpowder as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which means that a few hits and your gun becomes completely worthless peashooter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Again here look at the way the bolts just go right through that guy). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In your tank is equipped with three Special Weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Use by holding down the D-Pad and then firing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The homing missiles are far and away the most effective - so useful for shooting enemies what can and can't reach! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The H icon is for hover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After Level 3 need to get a hover upgrade meaning your tank can briefly fly a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's needed to get to the top of a cliff to the entrance Level 4, but brings up hover energy very quickly so you can't use very often. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game has eight levels all quite distinct and large, including this cool underground sewer level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The background rabbits are quite good; Everything looks very atmospheric and levels all feel, sort of, dangerous. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Definitely the most grueling level is the underwater one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you enter the water or Sofia seems like a stone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Clean to leave the tank and make the bosses later by herself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll miss not having all Sofia's weaponry on this level since you're quite weak. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 final boss here will be a giant crab boss that will drop an upgrade that allow Sophia to operate underwater. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So an upgrade that allows you to travel underwater. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot of later games use this (like "metroid" prime). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is "Blaster Master" the first time this appears in the video game? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A later upgrade allows you to climb walls (again necessary to get to the next level). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another thing about "Blaster Master" the end game world is quite big and backtracking is required. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After completing Level 3 to go all the way back beginning at Level 1 to reach Level 4. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some people complain about this, but there are a few shortcuts to be bound. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Daniel actually tells you how levels are linked together so it's nice to be completely in the dark. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For those who [only] have the cartridge or playing on an emulator, you might want to look at a map online. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's the usual ice levels, three ledges, the lava level that we see here, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now when you enter the last level, you can upgrade the lights to climb ceilings as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you can [pretty] much drive everywhere once you have that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As cool as that is, it can be a bit tricky because you often want to make a jump if you're on a lead but you end up climbing around the bottom of the ledge instead. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This level here is perhaps the toughest; those spiky things will kill you very quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you have to have some hover energy left or to make certain narrow jumps. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And he fell to shoot down those Caterpillar guys for the land Things will get real ugly real quick,. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Touching enemies doesn't damage them and you have no grace invulnerability. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So an enemy can move in the same direction as you all touching you into constant damage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now I should point out this game is hard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's long, complicated, has tough bosses (which you fight with lousy weapons). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And (incredibly!) there's no passwords or battery save options. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to complete it in one sitting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's an extremely bad decision on some socks apart. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also have limited continues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know I look at the speed run for black To master and 42 minutes (over twice as long as "Metroid" and a bit longer than "...Zelda" or simply the night). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, that's the final boss right there - the guy in the box cover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Very impressive looking. But turns these up., Of course, the real Final boss, - that's actually this guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first guy we saw a second ago - he has those spheres that he spits out that does big damage, and you can [only] get hit a couple times before dying. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, this last cost here is he's a bit easier to avoid because your health is not regenerate, between bosses,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Currently about 150 grenade hits required to kill them according to one fat I read. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, despite my myriad complaints "Blaster Master" really is the great game and one of those games that 8-bit gaming aficionados just love. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It when made by Konami that would be no surprise but the amazing thing is it doesn't resemble any of Sunsoft earlier game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, one thing, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How did you get Fred back and what exactly caused his hair to turn green? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, there is a hidden A huge leap in quality ambition shown here, which is very impressive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess there's a certain amount of mystery around the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like who exactly were to chi engineering and who is the Frankie who's listed as the game designer? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, hopefully the Golden Age of Sunsoft is now upon us (The Sunsoft of Batman euphoria and gimmick instead of the Sunsoft up, boy Alan). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And one last thing check out the bad English in the congratulation screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that is "Blaster Master". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully can never play this game Give it a try. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 1943: The Battle of Midway 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 June 20 🇯🇵 // 1988 October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ready for some will classic shoe action from Capcom? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess I would I call it classic but is [pretty] decent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 1943 the Battle of Midway is the sequel to "1942", capital Tom's early Shoot-'em-Up, originally released in arcades in 1984. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the 1940 series you control a p 38. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That attempts to single handedly destroy the Japanese Navy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 1943. portly takes place during the Battle of Midway. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what was the Battle of Midway? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 An important naval battle that took place off the Midway Atoll, smack dab in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Japan didn't want us to have a base of operations to launch tax towards Asia, so they plan to take the Midway islands. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, the Japanese naval code had been broken and the U.S. Navy was able to get reinforcements in time, and Japan ended up losing all four of its aircraft carriers sent to battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The defeat was so bad the Japanese Imperial Navy lied and said they won for propaganda purposes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And oh yeah, it took place in June 1942. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade Game (seen here) came out in 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was similar to "1942" but with some modern features - more power-ups, a Life Bar, and even into level bosses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 He got some [pretty] cool weapons like the Spread shot and the shot gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The [only] thing was Special Weapons would disappear when their timer ran out, and your Health Bar was slowly decreasing as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was possible end up not being the boss, he didn't damage a certain percentage of them quickly enough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, it was a [pretty] cool game! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the home version, you start by setting points to your attributes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'What's that? Attributes?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the first game (which was ported by Micronics) Capcom did 1943 themselves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, they changed stuff around a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the added R.P.G. elements to Shoot-'em-Up! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, why not? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally special items will be found that it, sort of, add additional points those attributes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you, sort of, Level Up your plane as the game progresses - you increase your attack power, Life Bar, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Every level has you fighting waves and waves of airplanes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Red airplanes drop power-ups and these are actually shot to, sort of, 'TwinBee'-style. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They will start off with like a partial Life Bar refill, and then shooting them will cause them to change to power-ups, or weapons, or better Life Bar refills. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess The strategy here is for a bounce or picking up power-ups and health refills. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And so possibly want to have a Special Weapon when you reach the boss and plenty of help. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here's a typical boss - a large warship. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object here to knock out all guns and cannons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you slowly inch forward all fighting a boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One problem sometimes you'll encounter is barely enough room to squeeze in below a gun, but it's near the bottom of the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When this happens, it's really easy to get hit when the gun fires - almost impossible to get away in time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So once the boss is defeated, you get some initial health points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are added on to your existing health points, thus raising your total health,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your total health will tend to increase as the game progresses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So well 1943 is [pretty] slick There are some issues modern Shooter fans might have. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, there are quite a few levels (24) and they can get [pretty] repetitive (because there's a very limited number of enemies). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the bosses actually repeat themselves quite a bit! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thank God there is a password system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You get a password and then you die. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you really can finish the game with enough perseverance. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the whole business of taking Special Weapons that have a timer on them and your health slowly pin down as well as [pretty] hateful! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's often not a power-up close to the boss and sometimes you end up having to enter a boss fight with no Special Weapon and low health. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I hate it when there's a few moments of, like, nothing happening like when you're approaching a boss or flowers and empty water and you can see your, your various timers like running down. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Through all Kawan Hurry up to the boss; I've [only] got 10 seconds left on a three way shot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, it's not always easy to get the item that you're looking for when you get a power-up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is, especially true on the later levels where there are so many enemies on screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It makes it virtually impossible to hit the power-up, much less than the correct number of times to get the item that you want. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last levels have these multiple bosses and they're all repeats of earlier bosses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These guys can get [pretty] easy with a quick weapon darn hard without it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like this guy right here, for example: if you don't have this, this three way shot, he's [pretty] tough because you have to dodge bullets while hitting the wings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy is basically a more difficult version of the same thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the last little end with a whole bunch of battleships and I ended up not finishing it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The problem was not being able to collect the power-ups during the regular part of the level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I basically light up health and weapons towards the end. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So 1943 it's a good if not great game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nowadays, we probably expect a bit more variety ever Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fire Rock 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 June 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by System Sacom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Use 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow, now we're getting into some sketchy stuff, "Fire Rock" from the System Sacom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember "Fire Bam" from HAL a few episodes ago? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well this is worse than that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Specifically, this is "Mark Flint Presents Fire Rock". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now Who the hell is Mark Flint? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He was a programmer at System Sacom who's considered "legendary", by some folks in the Japanese video game field. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This title screen would certainly indicate some great programming skills - if this were an Atari 2600 games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was published by Use who apparently quite committed to putting out low quality games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Mark one was a guy from Texas who ended up working for some Japanese software companies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He seems [pretty] well-known for a 1986 p.C.-98 game called the "Highway Star". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose this game is [pretty] impressive for a 3D game in 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not sure exactly why is named speaker so predominantly in the System Sacom games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess they really like the guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the one game we might know in the U.S. that Mark Flint was attached to is "mansion of hidden souls". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Horrible voice acting coming up in 3, 2, 1... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Where am I?". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, great! It's a first-person "MYST"-like Adventure Game that Was (oddly enough) re-released for the Saturn by Sega. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, I guess it looks [pretty] decent for the era. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay so back to "Fire Rock". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well this looks like your average everyday third person side you actually Platformer type game - but with a twist! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It involves a lot of climbing up walls and the controls are awkward (to put it kindly). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Awkward in this case is a euphemism for 'big goddamn suck'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when you first try this game you're going to end up in that pool a lava - probably more than once. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As soon as you start touching lobby into bounce around spasm can't jump out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can jump and land on the walls; and pressing a cause do to climb up, but it seems impossible to actually land on top of the platform. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And your weapon does like build brick holes in the walls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what do you do? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game just started and already I'm stuck! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the trick. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To climb a wall need to walk Are jump to it and then press the D-Pad to the left or the right (towards the wall). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You got to glue down your finger on that D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Do not decrease pressure on the D-Pad for even the tiniest bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You slowly hit the A button over and over again you want to go up be if you're going down,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Very carefully make your way to the top and climb over the top of the edge. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To get a chance grab that blue hardcore invincibility kill the purple blob thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Ah, there we go.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now hopefully you have mastered the wall climbing mechanic because you're going to be constantly using it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, almost every single ledge is too high to jump on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To get around requires constant wall climbing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And letting your finger lacs for even a moment will always result in falling into a conveniently placed a lava pit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So have fun! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, by the way, there's a cheat that prevents you from taking damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You turn on the game and hold down A and B together. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let the title screen text load up 16 times and then hit Start. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But even though that that "Fire Rock" is still a big pain in the ass. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enemies attack you are climbing walls - and if there's a way to shoot while on a wall, I certainly could not find it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is a really hard to reach and when you jump and try to latch on to a wall sometimes you hang on and sometimes you fall. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so this is definitely not the worst game we've seen for the F.D.S. - and I kind of like the music! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But damn that wall-climbing gets real old fast. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, not cool, Mr. Mark Flint! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 The Chrontendo History of Adventure Games: Part 2 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're going to take a little break from the FamiCom and go back to Adventure Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's time for the second final part of our "History of Adventure Games". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last time we covered from the birth of the genre (in the U.S.) from the early text games like "Colossal Cave" up to Sierra's domination in the late '80s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Japan, we saw the clunky text parsers and old P.C.-88 games give way more streamlined menus in "Portopia..." and the many games that followed in its wake. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Part 3: Adventure Games in The West: 1984 - 2010 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned last time, the Sierra Graphic Adventure Games used a standard text parser to make your character interact with the world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this was beginning to change! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1984, Apple released the Macintosh computer, which integrated a mouse into its input scheme. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Enchanted Scepters ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Game Developers very quick to make good use of the mouse. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in 1984, an Adventure Game, called "Enchanted Scepters", was released by a little software company called Silicon Beach Software. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So rather than typing text, you used the mouse to make words from the command menus along the top. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much like the menus in Japanese Metro games, this eliminated need to memorize a games vocabulary and syntax. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Déjà Vu [Mentions: "The Uninvited" "Shadowgate"] ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next year, a far more successful game was released from -- by ICOM Simulations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Deja Vu" let you use the mouse to click on objects or scenery, drag and drop items to and from your inventory, select actions from a menu, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The premise was not too original (you played a hard-boiled detective with amnesia), but the point-and-click mechanic opened up huge possibilities for the genre. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 ICOM followed up "Deja Vu" with two more point-and-click Adventure Games, the spooky the "Uninvited", and the dungeon crawling "Shadowgate". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All three, of course, were later ported to other computers and even the N.E.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 ICOM borrowed the DR morbid sense of humor found in Sierra's games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They also borrowed frequent and surprising deaths. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Doing anything (even something as harmless as opening a door [or] picking up an object) can suddenly kill! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this tradition goes way back Adventure Gaming, but actually soon came to an end. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Maniac Mansion ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Lucasfilm] Games, the game development branch of Lucasfilm, (later known as Lucas Arts) released "Maniac Mansion" for the Commodore 64. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It alter the course of video games in several ways. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, it dropped the text parser and I said to the point-and-click system to move your character and to build sentences. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather than typing pick up the faucet you simply clicked on 'Pick up' in the menu and then the item you wish to grab. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The 'what is' query would help you identify important objects, as opposed to mere background detail. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Maniac Mansion" was also one of the first to insert cutscenes (and) that actually is, sort of, further the plot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, there are multiple ways to complete the game based on which characters you picked at the very beginning. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And perhaps most importantly, deaths were much more logical and there were no situations where the game became unwinnable because of a wrong decision earlier in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you missed an item, you could always go back and get it or find another solution. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Maniac Mansion" also introduced LucasArts' trademark goofy sense of humor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One classic moment is when you microwave Ed's pet hamster and then give it back to him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will cause your death but really, you had it coming. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 LucasArts' breaking into the Adventure Game scene ushered what I think we probably want to call the Golden Age Adventure Games,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Advances and graphics and sound technology and home computers meant gameplay, sort of, looking and sounding a lot better. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Secret of Monkey Island ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everything kind of came together in 1990's "Secret of Monkey Island", which was a product of veritable murderer's row of game designers - Tim Schafer, Ron Gilbert, and Dave Grossman. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By this time LucasArts have actually done away with in-game death entirely. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With enough perseverance, you could finish the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike, say, Japanese Dating Sims (which we'll see a little later) there was no way to lose by selecting a wrong dialogue choice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thus, you could spend less time worrying about screwing up and more time experimenting and having fun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it was an Adventure Game that that rewarded curiosity instead of punishing it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What a great concept! 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Space Quest IV ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the early '90s, high-quality Adventure Games are coming out of the woodwork. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sierra and modernize its from a bit with recent releases, decreasing streamline controls and BGA artwork as well as mouse in but. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Lots of little details made the end game worlds more interactive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, in "Space Quest" for (released in 1991) you could 'taste' or 'smell' items (often for very humorous effect). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, it was Still very easy to die. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Day of the Tentacle ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now about this time newest thetic possibilities were opening up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 LucasArts' "Day of the Tentacle" (a 1983 sequel to "Maniac Mansion") used an art style inspired by old Tex Avery cartoons and threw in like crazy time traveling plot, memorable characters, pose that actually makes sense, and a funny script. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This really one of the high points of Adventure Gaming. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Come on over here so I can punch you.". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "This must be that Woodstock...". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot of these early Adventure Games (or games around this time) had really bad voice acting but that's definitely not the case, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, everything is really top-notch! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you'll might notice is a very similar interface there to "Maniac Mansion". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 LucasArts kept this up for several years, releasing just one great game after another. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, there's going to be some sort of arms race in the mid-'90s See who caught the most beautiful-looking Adventure Game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Broken Sword ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One contender: Revolution Software's "Broken Sword" - a Europe conspiracy theory Mystery Game with some of the best looking 2D graphics ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not to mention very easy-to-use intuitive controls - and also, once again, great voice acting - everything you could want! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Have you met the clown before?". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "It's a long story.". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's how you choose your subject for dialogue, there - those little icons along the lower left. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "You speak very good English for a French girl.". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Thanks!". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Welcome aboard the PMS...". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail! ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 About this time, even Sierra was getting bleeding edge, with later entries in old series such as 'King's Quest' and 'Leisure Suit Larry' being among the best looking games out, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By this point to Larry games that have been in the frequent death thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, you can take as much time as you want escaping the claim without dying. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another nice touch: a map of the world! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, you'll find crazy options like 'Lick'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also a weird well, 'Where's Waldo' parody, and once again, a whole lot of excellent voice work. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "That wasn't worth it.". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Apparently...". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are so many like wrong objects in these games you can like click on and get like weird or interesting humorous descriptions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not like it's [only] items that actually have a use,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can pick up or describe or look at all kinds of crazy things. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So traditional 2D Adventure Games are doing [pretty] well (especially for about 94 to 95). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But things were changing. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the first signs came in 1991 when infocomm (guys behind the 'MacVenture' games) released "Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective" for computers and a relatively new TurboGrafx-16 C.D. add on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game demonstrated a relatively new technology, full motion video. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Clips of film actors and recorded voices took the place of the usual dialog windows and sprites. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "What did you learn, my friend?". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Not a thing, Holmes.". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, the full motion video was actually quite crude at this point due to the heavy amount of compression used in these cases. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game was not too successful. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸MYST [Mentions: "The Seventh Guest"] ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But two years later, another C.D.-ROM game took the world by storm. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "I realized the moment I fell into the fissure...". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! I'm sure you know this one, "MYST", from Cyan Worlds, became the so-called killer app of the still-new C.D.-ROM format. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In many ways Myst was radically different from most other Adventure Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was first-person, lacked dialogue, the [only] text was that found inside the occasional booklet you picked up, there was really no inventory to speak of, it was virtually plotless. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You wander around a mostly empty Island, solving puzzles on how to operate weird pieces of machinery. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yet the beautiful 3D graphics clever use of full motion video and sound design made a huge smash hit - the biggest selling Computer Game up to that point, moving about 6 million units. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There you see some of the very clever use of of the limited full motion video I was able at that time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was amazingly impressive when it first came out, believe it or not. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also more big selling C.D.-ROM games followed, including Virgin Interactive "the seventh guest". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Phantasmagoria ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1995, Sierra decided to go into the exciting world of FMV and released the game from Roberta Williams called "Phantasmagoria". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I love this double waking up from a dream sequence, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably surprised everyone the first time they sought. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now while structured, most likely, very much like a standard Adventure Game, sprites were replaced with digitized actors on a computer generated background. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One problem many are like most video game, the acting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or "Phantasmagoria" features a few seasoned actors (the most well-known being 1966 potstill Stevens) some of the former's that's worth like grade z movie quality. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the game produced Tons of controversy over its adults-[only] content - a bit of sex and a lot of gore. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Regardless, it was here his biggest selling Adventure Game, and they followed up with more FMV games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we see perhaps the two most problematic actors in terms of overacting, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "What do you say, huh?". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Gabriel Knight: The Beast Within ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both "MYST" and "Phantasmagoria" were both attempts to, sort of, draw non-gamers in the whole Adventure Game field, offering them games or perhaps a bit easier or had some sort of sensationalistic qualities to them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sierra's second Full Motion Video Game was "Gabriel Knight: The Beast Within". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was the second in the conspiracy-themed 'Gabriel Knight' series, in probably had better integration of live actors and computer generated content. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, photographic backgrounds were used. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And for the most part, the voice acting tends to be a little better. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Gabriel Knight himself with his, sort of, prosaic descriptions and southern drawl, comes up as having a, sort of, bit more character than the protagonist "Phantasmagoria". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Contains some in now". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game also uses a rather simple drop and drag system for moving around objects and even lead to visit various real world locations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We can go to the Marienplatz, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game utilizes photographs or the actual Marienplatz and you can even see such things as the famous glockenspiel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Unit glockenspiel.". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Neverhood ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Countless excellent game to the shelves around this time (Far too many to list here). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One very unique game was "the Neverhood Chronicles" (or just "The Neverhood") designed by some of the creators behind the 'Earthworm Jim' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Revenues and sprites or digitized actors used claymation, which is actually [pretty] genius idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is a certain "MYST" influence here, What would that silent hero an alien almost empty world, but it feels unlike any other game of its time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This kind of reminds me of like the moving from island to island moments in "RIVEN", for example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The sequels, sadly, were not Adventure Games, but rather other genres. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Grim Fandango ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the entire Adventure Game genre is very healthy until about 1987,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Suddenly it began dying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Adventure Games use expensive computer generated graphics, voicing acting and the 3D environments. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 LucasArts released a couple of last great Adventure Games such as "Grim Fandango" in 1998. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Amazingly high production values make the game of classic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's considered by some of the last great game of the genre. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which brings a point: 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By this time, the Adventure Gaming fan community had split in two. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 During times of games such as "Day of the Tentacle", the [only] room for debate is whether LucasArts or Sierra's game was merely brilliant or the greatest Of all time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now and no longer agreed on the merits of "MYST" or "Phantasmagoria", or the last games in the 'Gabriel Knight' or the 'King's Quest' series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some love them; others absolutely hated them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, big budget Adventure Games [pretty] much cease to exist. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last nail in the coffin came in 2004 when the long-in-development "Sam & Max" sequel was officially cancelled by Lucasarts. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "It looks like Don's rigged his computer". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Longest Journey ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, the genre continued to plug along at the hands of independent or European developers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Funcom's "The Longest Journey" from 1991 of the more well-known traditional Adventure Games, featuring nice production values, though is, sort of, hammered by some rather ugly CG characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So on to the 2018 Adventure Game lived on the coast stands critics and small companies like Hong Kong, or Microids still believe in the genre. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game office also suffered from some kind of not particularly good Voice acting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "It's monkey boy!". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Told the very good-looking gaming rather interesting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whether or not you'll enjoy it, I mean it definitely does not have quite the same fun appeal of something like you know the old 'Sam & Max' or 'Monkey Island' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "It's same spot almost every day.". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again some very beautiful backgrounds, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And all the characters are, of course, full 3D. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Syberia ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Microids became one of the major developers for the genre in the 2000s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is "Syberia" from 2002. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, very nice graphics, an easy-to-use interface, and decent (if not spectacular) music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Use that key the script from the inventory, drag and drop it on the object. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there you go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game has many fans And then they got [pretty] good reviews but it seems in some ways to me through like a big beautiful but completely empty world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "No need to go down there.". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, you'll be hearing that a lot in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean why make all these houses and doors clickable if you can never interim? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It awful also suffers from pixel hunting syndrome. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And some folks feel the puzzles are too easy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Office is worth like search all around you find that it opens up the door to the puzzle or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And people complain about nowadays, console games having graphics are all gray and brown. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Same thing goes for this as well. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Conclusion [Mentions: Telltale Games, "Sam & Max" "Monkey Island" "Machinarium"] ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the last couple years there has been a big comeback in the genre, perhaps due to several LucasArts designers forming Telltale Games and writing 'Sam & Max' and 'Monkey Island', as well as, sort of, high profile Europe And titles like "Machinarium". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But still, in the West, while the Adventure Game genre might not be completely dead, it's certainly relatively quiet. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The same can definitely not be said for Japan however. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Part 4: Adventure Games in Japan: 1989 - 2010 ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Cobra: Kokuryu o no Densetsu ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So in Japan, things turned out quite a bit differently! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've seen Adventure Games proliferate on the FamiCom in Japanese computers, but things begin to change with the release of the P.C. Engine C.D. add-on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first Adventure Game on that system was "Cobra: and cuckoo no Densetsu" from Hudson (based on a manga and anime of the same name). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Look at these impressive graphics, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now while this isn't really too much different than what we've seen before, gameplay-wise, it's a [pretty] big leap over FamiCom games, in terms of graphics, and C.D. sound that the actual inner speech could be included. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] impressive! 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Space Adventure Cobra: The Legendary Bandit ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Incidentally This was popular enough to warrant a sequel, which was released in the U.S. under the name "space Adventure Cobra: the legendary bandit" on the Sega C.D.). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Nishimura Kyoutarou: Hokutosei no Onna ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now developers had do something with all that extra space on a C.D. so long animated intros became popular. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ooh, this is [pretty] gory! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These were, sort of, more elaborate versions of the intros seen in other FamiCom Adventure Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is "Nishimura que Otero" from Zacks It's all - sort of, a typical Murder Mystery Adventure Game, just like we've been seeing [only], sort of, bumped up to the next generation. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Tokimeki Memorial ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, the P.C. Engine became home to lots of [pretty] girl games, sometimes in the form of Mahjong games, R.P.G.s,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the most successful in the long run was "tokimeki Memorial". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami borrowed the general idea of a Dating Sim (Not to mention the title) from Nintendo's "knocking a meal" game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But unlike a lot of similar games, this really was a, sort of, sim. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Video like to build up stats and operate strategic to cultivate a relationship with a girl. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's, sort of, like 'Harvest Moon' but with romance instead of farming. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Angelique ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other end of the spectrum, we have Chloe's "Angelica". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First release a few months after "tokimeki Memorial" by kohi for the Super FamiCom, "Angelica" is an atomic game (meaning a Dating Sim for girls). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here the object is to win the heart of one of several young princes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of them are rather androgynous looking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like tokimeki there is much more gameplay than later so-called datings sims. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Angelique Special ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also a very long tradition of releasing and releasing these games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, "Angelica" was ported to the Saturn and PlayStation with these anime cutscenes and voice acting all that sort of added on to the to the beginning, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game itself has occasional bits of voice acting as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than that, it's [pretty] Much the same game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Libraries of the P.C. Engine Saturn are cluttered with Dating Sims and various games involving pictures of cute anime style girls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think what kept those two platforms alive in Japan for so long was these types of games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Welcome to Pia Carrot ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After the P.C. Engine any C's next console was the ill fated P.C. FX which is by far the most Japanese game console ever released. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think its library consists entirely of R.P.G. Adventure Games and Dating Sims. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And every single game Peters like a big I'd animate check on the box art. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one "Welcome to pa carrot" is one of the few P.C. FX games to be fan-translated into English. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a tokimeki style Dating Sim with adult content (meaning that if you did all the right things when romance and the girl at the very end, you would get to sleep with her). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Usually the adult was reserved for non-Nintendo consoles, though the really dirty stuff would actually be on on the Computer versions always sometimes. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Welcome to Pia Carrot 2 [Mentions: "Sakura Taisen", "Persona 3" "Persona 4"] ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That said, it seems a little odd that pa carrot two was released on the Game Boy Color. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, you can tell Placing the influence in later games like "Sakura Taisen", or "Persona three" or "...four". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoever these old games like pick carrot can be a little opaque at times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you have to make exactly the right choices in order to win the girl. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really not clear when you're playing the game what those choices are. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm sure this was to increase a shelf life of the game you had to, sort of, play them over and over again experiment. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Policenauts ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the more well-known Adventure Games of this era (despite never having been released outside of Japan) is Hideo Kojima's "Policenauts". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First released in 1994 on the P.C.-98. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the spruced up a PlayStation port from two years later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, thanks to these per ban translation, the PlayStation game can now be enjoyed by folks in the English speaking world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This features [pretty] high-quality animated cutscenes and a large amount of voice work. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's definitely on the more high-end of the -- the gaming scale. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To gameplay resembles Western Adventure Games using a point Click System to look at items, move around, and talk to folks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or even some shooting sequences. These are not really implemented that well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike many of those games, its main emphasis is on telling the story, so Western gamers might find it a bit too linear and straightforward for their tastes. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Otogiriso ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While all this was going on Japanese Adventure Games were undergoing a bit of a change. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Koichi Nakamura's Chunsoft began publishing games themselves, as opposed to developing titles for Enix, starting with "otogar reseau". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was a Super FamiCom game in 1992. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nakamura had co design the FamiCom "Portopia" with Yuji horii. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Otogi Risa" was also a Mystery Adventure Game, but with a big difference! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The entire game interface and all the commands (are just look talk clutter) had been removed, the gameplay has been greatly streamlined, and the amount of text increased. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally you'll be presented with several options to choose from. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The player use the D-Pad and the button on the right to pick the option you want to choose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hotel griesa was really a Choose Your Own Adventure novel in video game form, with an emphasis on using the graphics and sounds, sort of, suck the player into the games world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps that's why Joseph called it a sound novel. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Machi [Mentions "428: Shibuya Scramble"] ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A follow-up with a couple other games with a FamiCom and then the big one, "Machi" for the Saturday in 1998. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Machi" is a very slick and high budget looking game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It uses still photographs and full motion video, but don't looks much more pleasing to the eye than say "Gabriel Knight: The Beast Within". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game concerns a group of individuals in the Shibuya district whose lives interlock in various ways. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game was quite successful in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you might recall from a few episodes ago, came in number five and the 2006 coming to leaders pull the greatest video games of all time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A long way to spiritual sequel, four to eight was released for the Wii in 2008 And immediately received a perfect score and family to. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And various multimedia of spin-offs. occurred. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Shizuku ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright now let's move on to C.D. or territory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Adult games have been around in Japan as long as personal computers have. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there were plenty of adult themed Adventure Games R.P.G.s, Mahjong games and so on in the 1980s and early '90s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the whole adult Visual Novel genre was popularized by a series of games from a company called leap, starting with shizuku (which means a drop or maybe drip) in 1996. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For whatever reason, this format (massive amount of text, coupled with an occasional A button or B button decision) greatly appealed the Japanese gamers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And just as the Adventure Game was dying in the West, it exploded in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tons of Visual Novels begin to appear in the mid to late '90s. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Critical Point ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of the very first have a U.S. release, "Critical Point" from 1998 by Sweet Basil. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All of these games are strikingly similar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The viewpoint's in first-person, you see a series of static backgrounds in front of which various characters are Hear, You converse with the characters, Sometimes you're required to make a decision or action or dialogue choice. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We just like those fish at the bottom of the oceans whose eyesight is actually over many generations, the gameplay of Visual Novels is, sort of, withered away to merely pressing the enter button a bunch of times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's always some sort of plot to make your way through. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But in the adult Visual Novels, your sub goals usually involve bidding one or more women in the game, distinguished by their prefabricated personality types and their wacky hair colors. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But since then, Visual Novels remain far and away the most popular Computer Game genre in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suspect a rather large chunk of those are adult names. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're relatively low development costs make it easier for independent helpers to crank these things out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some big hit titles and backward cred using pre-existing Visual Novel crater software engines. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Kanon ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Canon" from 1999. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Moving along, we have "Canon", one of the most popular Visual Novels of the era - eventually ported to the Dreamcast, PS2, and PSP with spin-off manga and anime as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So a dual Adventure Games are quite mainstream in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one involves a protagonist with amnesia, and throws in various supernatural elements. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, you attempt to woo a girl by picking the correct option which takes down from the right story path. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Tsukihime [Mentions: "Melty Blood"] ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Sukima" from type moon was another hugely popular Visual Novel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might have heard of its spin-off Fighting Game "Melty Blood" And that's what it's called. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, cute girls plus supernatural theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And once again, it's mostly just walls and walls of text with the occasional decision that needs to be made. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The ending that you get will depend on the decisions that you made throughout the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's always like several good endings and several bad endings in these things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's often like a perfect ending or something like that we had to make every single decision correctly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, whether or not a decision is correct or incorrect, it's, sort of, arbitrary at times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now at this point in time The Japanese Visual Novel thing was incredibly strong. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To give you an idea of just how strong, check in on the Visual Novel database website, they list around 60 titles released last month, August 2010. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, unlike the West, the Adventure Game genre is very strong - just in a form that most Western gamers wouldn't really accept as an Adventure Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To give you an idea, I looked by a walkthrough of "Sukima" And there's [only] about 35 Interactive decisions that you make in the entire game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And often, in the games that are pure sex games, there's even fewer decisions in those. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the [only] real objective is to go through the path of the game correctly, in order to like, have sex with the correct girls are all the girls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So some of these, you know, barely even resemble what we would actually call video games, which is why I guess they call them Visual Novels in Japan. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Conclusion: Back to the FamiCom games! ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that [pretty] much wraps it up! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now it's time to go back to the FamiCom games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Risa no Yousei Densetsu - Risa Tachibana 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 June 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, Konami, yay! what wonderful things those coming have for us this time? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First, geez! there's one seriously ugly title screen! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now we've seen Konami hop on the R.P.G. train some time ago with "Esper Dream". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now it's Adventure Game time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Reiza no yosei Densetsu reiza Tachibana" (or 'resists fairy tale') - Rita Tachibana being one of those so-called idols, just like Nakayama Miho. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game was apparently inspired by the success of the "not beyond Miho tokimeki High School" game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can hardly wait. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the Nintendo game ever This isn't really a Dating Sim. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As the name implies, it's a "Fairytale" themed Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your goal is to save the world - not get laid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there was a bit of a media camp Pain around this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Reason was, I guess, [pretty] popular at the time, had a few albums out, and even released a tie-in single bullet game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's give it a listen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Check out these moves! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, this woman is an incredibly talented dancer - A modern day is adore Duncan, if you will. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently the song and dance contain hints for the game itself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, you find reason lying unconscious and then you have your way with her. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, actually, (no, it's not that kind of game) You Wake her up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And she enlists your aid in saving the frickin fairytale world from an evil witch who wants to spread darkness over the world and need to find the magic symbols Blah, blah, blah. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why don't these games always involve finding some sort of magic or crystal or TriForce Or something silly like that? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 She's wearing a crown here for some reason or another. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, that's the witch. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now one to actually make your way to the fairytale world, the game becomes a standard menu-based Adventure Game, Except for one unusual feature. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It doesn't utilize the typical first-person viewpoint found in most games like this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The camera, if you will, as a bit further back, you can see both you and Risa at all times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's also like a third person venture game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess in some ways it's not completely original. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The most part though, it seems [pretty] much like "Princess tomato". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You go in, look at stuff, talk to people multiple times, wait for new areas to open up, and then use the Move option to go, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A little girl's name seems Be The Match Girl. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though this chapter actually involves a rat living in a basement I think. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's, sort of, based on the story of a Little Match Girl. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later chapters are based on Snow White, "Alice in Wonderland", and Cinderella stories. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Something else that's ripped directly from the "Nakayama Miho" Game, there are telephone numbers where you can get hints and that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, these numbers I'm sure stopped functioning many years ago. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, sorry to disappoint all you Konami fans. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If it's any consolation, "Blades of Steel" will be turning up next episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Youkai Douchuuki 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 June 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco | Use Production 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namco makes a surprise appearance here with "Yokai dotu key" (or what as it was not an English "Shadowland" - though literal translation would be 'Yokai Travel Journal') - Yokai being those weird Japanese ghost demon things that pop up in numerous video games like "Gegege no Kitaro". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This should look familiar because it's the third time we've seen it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It first popped up in the "1987 Arcade Round-Up", then again in "Chronturbo Episode One", when a port for the P.C. Engine (courtesy of Tose) came out in February 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was, in fact, the first third-party game released for the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, five months later, FamiCom owners finally got a chance to play the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was ported by Now Production, the guys behind Namco's "Gq uten Tobias", that horrible R.P.G. from 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though later they would go on to more reparable stuff, including (surprisingly) "Katamari damacy". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, this is clearly a lot uglier in the P.C. Engine Arcade Game, but there's a bit more faithful to the original ban the P.C. Engine version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though a new aspect has been added that wasn't in the other two versions - your Pious Meter, which directly affects whether you go to Heaven or help in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might be thinking, 'Hmm, I, sort of, remember or something similar another game for a while back.'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, that was "Spelunker II" at wacky Japan on a sequel to "Spelunker" it had a token meter token meaning virtue that got too low he went to hell. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And guess who developed "Spelunker II", I wonder? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why it was Now Production! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess that's their thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another difference is during boss battles, you will need to have a scroll to call on the spirit to fight for you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise you have to fight demons yourself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To pick up these scrolls here in, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than that, there's not that much notable about the FamiCom "Youkai Douchuuki" beyond what's already been said in 'Chronturbo'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess play that version instead or (heck!) play the Arcade Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sanada Juu Yuushi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 June 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, it's R.P.G. time from Kemco, though it's not really clear who developed this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmm! I sense ninjas will be involved. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Sanada Juu Yuushi" which normally is translated into English as 'Sanada Ten Braves'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Now what are these Sanada Ten Braves?', you ask. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, Sanada Masayuki was one of the major Sengoku Era daimyo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 His son sanada Yukimura became quite well-known for his military exploits. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a statue of him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The sonatas were aligned against a Yasuo Tokugawa. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Legend has it that there were 10 warriors (or ninjas) who acted as you can, whereas retainers - the most famous of which was Sarah Toby Satsuki (one of the major Legendary Ninja dudes). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's sometimes depicted as a wild monkey like kid like in this animated film about him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, the sonatas and Zuki has turned up in various video games among those and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, your first thoughts are probably, 'Hey, look at "Dragon Warrior" clone!'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you're right; this borrows heavily from the look of the 'Dragon Warrior' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, underneath the hood, it's actually quite a bit different. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whereas "Dragon Quest II" hide you, sort of, run around and find two other party members. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here you need to find all 10 Braves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we'll head on out to the town. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll find that typical R.P.G. village stuff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in to 'Dragon Quest'-style among the other various shops, there's a place to gamble. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is one of those games where you bet on whether the dice will turn up otter even. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's pure luck, of course. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you want to perform some Save State abuse, then you can make some tall cash. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to buy weapons and food. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now things work a bit differently here than most R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The options on your character menu are a little odd. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from the usual talk and whatnot, you have the option to issue commands to other members of your party and to check your war provisions (which seems to consist of food weapons). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've just Found the first brave, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is Suki I believe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Generally you will have to form some kind of task before they'll join you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Different party members will require different weapons, by the way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sanada himself uses, uh, swords, I believe; the ninjas use like throwing stars or bombs or whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In combat each turn will give you the option to select a party member. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Battles are hot one-on-one, since there's [only] ever one enemy of time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you can choose a party member to fight the first round and then the second round you can choose a different one if you prefer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The various braves will often come in handy in other situations as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here a guard wouldn't gate blocks this mountain pass. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One guy is able to set off bombs. So select him from the main menu and he'll bomb and blow up the gate for you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when encountering encountering enemies, there's another option (other than run or fight) there's 'talk'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This allows you to negotiate with enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, as far as I can tell, enemies (or The enemy's army) might join you in exchange for weapons or food, I believe. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't really see anything like a level, per se, on your characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Their strength simply based on the size of their army. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, not to have 32 men in his army. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this all sounds very interesting but isn't actually a good game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, Kemco's track record is point two hot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I post there aren't a whole lot of enemy types. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As the game progresses, you still keep getting more of the same enemy types. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They just have more troops. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And but you do get these other weird real guys in dayglow purple suits with guns who turn up from time to time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All in all, it appears to be a rather strange R.P.G. that sort of fallen through the cracks. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 June 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last game of June and it's... (oh geez) "Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium" From Taito. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Developed by, who knows? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But every other single Taito original game so far has been the product of Tose or some of the other low end contract developers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is got to be from one of those guys. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a cute little title sequence, however. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Guy gets crushed by a giant Baseball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That represents how you feel when you play the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the way, the title means something like 'Ultimate Excitement Stadium'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Hari Curie' means 'enthusiasm' or 'excitement'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not to be confused with 'heart carry', meaning 'suicide via self disempowerment'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I got the two words mixed up at first. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, you know, I'm getting [pretty] sick and tired of all these 'Family Stadium' clones we've been seeing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We just had one last episode, "Major League Baseball". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, I'd be perfectly happy if I never saw another 8-bit Baseball Game as long as I lived. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is just like all the others, more or less. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The controls weren't the same way as every other such game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When betting while playing against the CPU, you'll get annoyed by the fact that C.P.U. will catch errors Every single flyball without fail. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of these players was locked to exactly where the ball is going to land. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you're filming ever, it's typical to tell exactly where the ball is going (early, how high it is any given time) you have to watch the shadow,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it's difficult to say if the balls like right above your head are just going to sail right over you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally when you're pitching th C.P.U. will hit almost every single pitch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Getting strikes is [pretty] difficult. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, the usual complaints apply. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can't see your outfielders until the ball actually reaches the outfield, making it very difficult to get them into position. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really, this game is instantly forgettable and back I'm already getting it kind of confused with "Major League Baseball" from last episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I actually skipped both this game and that game if I were you. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Akara Senki Raijin 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 12 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Microcabin 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by DOG 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 July 12th marks a special day. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll tell you why in just a sec. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's load this thing up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it is "Akara Senki Raijin", published by Square's D.O.G. label and built by Micro Cabin. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And yes, this is all there is in terms of an intro: "Combat Action Game". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least you're met guy looks badass. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the joke's on you, I'm afraid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like all F.D.S. games are usually some serious loading screens. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so the game starts and what do you do? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Start by going up, but can't go up, can't go to the side... or really anywhere! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, we'll start pushing some random buttons and you'll find the Select button turns you into a spaceship. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Akara Senki Raijin" is a Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wonderful, right? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, just you wait. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, he knows the initiates are way faster and more maneuverable than you and they seem to take off and multiple hits to kill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can [only] have three bullets on the screen at once. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you try to rapid fire on the bullets [only], like maybe one third of the length of the screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now seriously, you think you'd want to unleash as many bolts as possible under order to take out waves these guys but nope, three bullets. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Feels like you're playing "Zanac" with "Space Invaders" weapons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When a wave of enemies come to you, if you don't get out of the way, you're probably going to get hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you're close enough to shoot them, there's a good chance they will also shoot you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have a Special Weapon fired with the B button. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it's more comparable to like a regular Shema weapon but you can [only] fire like 20 times until they find refills. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Important along you'll reach this dead end; You take damage if you don't stop by turning back into a robot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you keep going or actually hit the wall and take some damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then those guys you saw a moment ago decide to come out and kick your ass. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not really a fair fight because they always shoot directly at you and at an angle at the same time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everyone totally outgunned you in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To this point, what do you do? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, who knows eventually, if you Turn around and head back, you might find certain screens you can land on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One (midway level) has passed leading to the left and the right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you can head down these and explore. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, let me get back to why July 12th was a special day. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 D.O.G. released two games that day, this and "Moonball Magic", which were the last two games ever for the label. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! Square dropped the whole D.O.G. business and released all future games in cartridge form. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And so these two games were [only] released in the FamiCom Disk Writer format; they were never-released as regular retail packages (ya know, where you bought a blank disk and had the program written onto it). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that seems possible, but I did find some cover art for the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's hard to say. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now if the name micro Cabin sounds familiar, it's because they did a lot of those games in the "History of [the] Adventure Games" segment from last episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They did like tons of P.C.-88 and P.C.-98 games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the [only] FamiCom game they've been attached to, though they are still around today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps they're boast well In series its 'Princess Maker'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well back to the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can wander around and find some items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What do they do? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How do you leave the level? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I have no idea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No the items I found seemed to use for moving that barrier on the last screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whole thing seemed for like a low rent version of "...Guardian Legend". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, the rest of this game turns out, the shooting sequences are so poorly executed nothing could really save this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When it comes to Shoot-'em-Ups, Square would eventually redeem themselves in the game called "Einhander". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But obviously that's not until many years later. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Moonball Magic 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 12 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by System Sacom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by DOG 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the other game from GOG. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey my buddy Mark Flint, "Moonball Magic". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Swear that System Sacom developed two Mark Flint games for two different publishers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They both have the same intro screen and everything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess is the demo, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey wait a second I lost a life? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is this the game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Clippers are moving when I hit the buttons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Am I already playing? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So before I was even aware of the game started I've already lost. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To try this again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What's going on here? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh I see is the title sequence - II to get the ball in the slot in order to start the game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, Mark Flint, got me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mark Flint: one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Doctor sparkle: zero. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is not yet over. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All admit it's a clever idea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So moonwalk magic is a Pinball Game (because the moment is silver and round just like pinball). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thing actually seems to go on and on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Finally! here we go. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the game itself will actually start. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Any point you earn during that intro will actually carry over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now what drives me crazy is the music on the first level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What is it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It sounds like J.S. Bach or something, but I just can't quite seem to place it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think all the music is for this game has been borrowed from classical pieces. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now unlike Nintendo's old "Pinball" game, this one has multiple levels (11 to be precise). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In order to move on to the next level, you'd have to get the ball in a particular slot; it's that one kind of have a gray top in the center. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're not that difficult at first, but really starts getting rough around Level 3. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, unlike something we'll get, there's actually quite a bit of variety. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's not just one screen, there's a lot of different levels (like the 11) and they're all completely different. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this, as I mentioned, isn't back Last game on the label. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Can't say I'll miss it because 99% of their stuff was crap. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most D.O.G. games were apparently very unsuccessful, supposedly so much so that it drove Square to the edge of bankruptcy as the old story goes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, unlike a chorus, hinky region there isn't I couldn't find a cover to this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So some of the fun really was [only] available for the disk writer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, I guess it's, sort of, a rather inglorious end to D.O.G.. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Black Onyx 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 14 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bullet-Proof Software | Goblin Sound 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bullet-Proof Software 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "BPS". Sure it sounds like an acronym for some unpleasant medical condition, but it really stands for BulletProof Software. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last game today is "Super Black Onyx". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 BPS, as you may recall, is the brainchild of Hank Rogers, seen here posing in front of the "Super Black Onyx" cover art - by Roger Dean, apparently. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this game is a highly modified port of Bulletproof Software's first game, "Black Onyx", originally released on the P.C.-88 way back in 1984. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In David shift's book, "Game Over", he gives the following story about "Black Onyx". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hank's family had moved to Japan in the late '70s, and Hank had to go to the software business. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So he whipped up "Black Onyx" and published it himself, but no one would buy it because the Japanese had no idea what an R.P.G. was. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unless he took copies some software magazine explained the whole concept of R.P.G.s and summed up everyone that I was hooked. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The magazine published a glowing review, "Black Onyx" was a huge hit, and basically started the Japanese obsession with R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Supposedly this happened in 1980. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know about that date. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Couldn't find any record of this coming out on older computer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The story is kind I'm short on details. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The magazine is not actually named. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Did it happen? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original "Black Onyx" supreme is the standard "Wizardry" "Ultima" type R.P.G. that takes advantage of the P.C. at its graphical power. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was, sort of, odd, you can customize your characters hair and clothing but nothing else. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's not even a magic in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now for "Super Black Onyx", choose your characters from several prefabricated selections (Hero, Monk, Mage - those are the three classes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmm! Well, there's an awful lot of characters, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why are there so many? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they all have the same stats! (10 dexterity and 12 strength). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Geez! How many are there are these guys? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, incredibly, there are around 45 or so choices for your starting characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then several times in the game you encounter tons of more potential party members. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It puts "widow can" to shame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the [only] difference between these guys is the names, so... I don't know crazy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why that is let you choose the name? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so once you pick your character you enter the dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, just like the "Deep Dungeon", every single thing is inside the dungeon in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start off in the town. (And yes, it's another town inside the dungeon) and wander around looking for potential party members to join you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the dungeon walls look [pretty] good. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But these can be, sort of, like cupboard like a return surface or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not really sure. Who decorates dungeons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I ran with this guy who's a monk,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I give him the symbol say, 'Hey, you know, let's not fight' and he'll automatically join your party. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you can say yes or no there whether you want him to join or not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And basically repeat this until you have a full party. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so I've got five guys, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's go fight some monsters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point. You can't buy anything because you have, as of yet, no Gold. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a whole shop just for captains. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the first challenge is to find your way out of the town into the real dungeon - and this will not be easy! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Super Black Onyx" is a first-person dungeon car with no map and every hole looks [pretty] much exactly alike. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And every five steps you will run to another aspiring party member. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting all the shops are [only] sell one thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why can't there be like a general armor and weapons store like every other R.P.G.? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So eventually after wandering around aimlessly February might get lucky and find the door to take through the dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you'll fight monsters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the battle system is weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nope, those bars below your names. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those are your life, dexterity, and strength bars. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, I know it doesn't say that. But that's what they are. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To fight you select the fight icon from your party leader. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That everyone will throw their weapons one at a time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully the weapon will hover in midair per sec. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If so, hit the A button and you will hopefully hit the opponent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hit it multiple times you might get in more than one hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you might not get any hits at all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also use magic and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, nothing is labeled. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead of words The game is a series of, sort of, very similar looking little icons or your spells and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, naturally battles occur about every five steps. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Black Onyx" (the original game) is sometimes considered to be the first Japanese R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know if I agree with that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was a western-style R.P.G. created by a Westerner who just happened to be living in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So maybe "Dragon Slayer" was first a real Japanese R.P.G.? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Assuming we even consider "Dragon Slayer" to be an R.P.G.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Winning rate similar to like onyx is far from perfect. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The interface is painful to use, it really could use some labels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And so the game re spent countless hours walking down on distinct hallways fighting protracted battles with numeric characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If that is your, sort of, thing, I'd say take a look. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 32 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's [pretty] clear that FamiCom developers are plotting to drive me crazy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was just complaining about Baseball Games and next episode we have two more Baseball Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, we've got two very interesting Sports Games and they aren't even Golf or Baseball Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But best of all, we have a much loved classic from Capcom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I hope I'll see you then. 🍇🍌
