👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 31 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hello, everyone and welcome to the obscenely delayed 31st episode of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 My apologies for getting this thing out so late, but I'm going to delay it just a bit longer with a few important announcements. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This episode will feature the fantastic and informative "History of Adventure Games". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But because this was so long, a couple things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, it got cut in half, this episode will feature the first half. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also it made the episode itself so long, that we're [only] doing 13 games instead of 15. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, other than that, we've got the usual stuff on display here today, wacky Adventure Games, horrible R.P.G.s and even a cool Action Game from Konami. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now that that's out of the way, let's go ahead and proceed. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 FamiCom Tantei Club - Kieta Koukeisha 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so what's on the menu today? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, how about Adventure Games and R.P.G.s? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First up is one from Nintendo themselves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 FamiCom tant a club it Acacia. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mer back in "Chrontendo ... 22". We saw that in Kashi bonacci Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was an app D.S. game released separately on two discs about a month apart. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well FamiCom 10 a club is a follow-up to that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I had praised Nintendo for his creativity and giving the coffee bonacci a Japanese folklore setting, rather than a typical Murder Mystery plot found in most other Adventure Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess I guess I have to take it back now because as of April 1988, Nintendo enters the crowded field of "Portopia" clones. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that can With the spiky hair, (that's you) and you've got get this amnesia. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, you're detected with amnesia. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sounds a lot like the Mac Adventure Game deja vu, doesn't it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Winston's Well, yeah, probably. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Nintendo introduced some innovations in their earlier Adventure Games like switching between two characters and makowski bonacci or branching dialogue trees in that Nakayama Miho Dating Sim game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There really as far as I can tell, none of that's on display, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's the standard "Portopia..."-style gameplay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's like the usual ask, investigate, change location, call, et cetera On the menu options, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another thing (and we've seen this before) is like the delayed title screen, which appears after a few minutes of gameplay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This seems like it was taken directly out of Hokkaido renza Tetsujin, which was Yuji horii is por topia sequel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this game even actually has a maze at the end Just like Port opia. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Title screen here is [pretty] nice looking, I guess - sort of, an understated atmospheric illustration. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A number of impressive names appear in the credits, namely gunpei Yokoi and Soetoro Cotta as producer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And "Metroid" trader or Xu Sakamoto as director, all the guys who are, you know, involved in much more interesting stuff than this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And as I mentioned, just like makowski bonacci, disc one was released first, and then the second half of the game was released on this too, which can a bit later on June 14. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, one interesting fact in 2004, Nintendo released a series of early FamiCom games for the Game Boy advanced under the name FamiCom Mini. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These weren't remakes are actually more like direct ports. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They looked exactly like the original game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There were the early Mario games, "...Zelda", "Metroid" and so on up through the tooth FamiCom 10 take club games, this one and it's sequel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I know these are actually the last family com games to get ported to that series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Guess the classic Nintendo FamiCom era, sort of, officially ends with FamiCom tiantai Club. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, Japanese Murder Mystery Games are gradually becoming, sort of, more text heavy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Compared to this to Portopia, and you'll see just how much everyone talks; almost like a Visual Novel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game involves you investigating the death of the head of a wealthy family. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (No surprise there.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But presumably a good story is the main appeal this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Was successful in a couple of sequels, but sadly, that's not yet been translated in English. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Elysion 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Systemsoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tokyo Shoseki 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This first game here I was actually really looking forward to. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not sure why was it was released by Tokyo Seki, who don't really have a great track record. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're a textbook company and mostly released educational games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It looks like the game itself was by the system soft people. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, I heard this was a "...Zelda" clone and we haven't really had too many of those. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was coming treat a completely unknown "...Zelda"-style game recently translated in English. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sounds interesting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, well, it turns out I was wrong. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was trying to talk to the guards here, but no go. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can't ever talk to a King naturally once you get inside the castle, and he'll give you the whole scoop. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some sort of evil being named bail, he must stop him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well fancy that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But first, he wants to prove yourself by fetching some stuff out of his dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yet, the King just happens to have an enormous dungeon right on the premises many times larger than his castle itself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we've got some good old-fashioned dungeon crawling to do. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now at some point, it's going to be clear that illusion isn't really a "...Zelda" clone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's rather a pre-'Dragon Quest'-style R.P.G. and Action R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it's important the Japanese computer R.P.G.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point there's not really anything to do other than every dungeon next door and start poking around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all opened up all these conveniently placed chests for some clothes weapon and one Healing Potion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The interface is [pretty] clumsy, use the B button to open the menu, and then the A button to make a selection in the menu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not sure why two buttons but that's the way it works. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you get into the dungeon proper, you'll encounter the usual slimes and skeletons and treasure chests. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is where illusion gets weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enemies [only] move when you do; take a look at the video, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, if you move one step or use your weapon once the enemy on screen will move one step as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what, sort of, turn-based movement I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Very odd, but since make it easier to avoid enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still you will always take damage fighting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And your heel spell is very expensive in terms of Magic Points to use. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah Wondering what the name of illusion means? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's a reference to the illusion fields. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was one of the Greek underworld warriors went to the illusion filled when they died. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, this game actually spells it quite yes incorrectly they put an O or the a is supposed to be. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, as I mentioned, illusion is a port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll take a look at the old Computer Game system stuff, apparently first published in 1986. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The controls are completely different. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here use function keys to carry out the various commands. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the layout of the game itself was, well I guess it's actually [pretty] much exactly the same as the FamiCom version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, note the characters are depicted more realistically in the cell of Western R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Pre "Dragon Warrior" R.P.G.s obviously had taken inspiration from Western games, and having super deformed or anime style characters was not yet in style. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because it's not really a bad looking game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I finally find that heroes ring I was looking for. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, I'm still on Level 1 (you appear to Level Up very slowly). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But when you equip the ring, you automatically shoot up to level five. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I know that's [pretty] strange, huh? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It should be pointed out that this dungeon is huge and is four floors deep. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's bigger than a final dungeon and games like 'Dragon Quest' and "Final Fantasy". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's full of monsters that can instantly kill you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually bigger than a lot of the later dungeons in illusion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the very first thing you have to do is to go through this dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So illusion is what we would call in today's terms unbalanced. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So your object now is to collect these scrolls around the world and a magic sword. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or the sword is actually missing some magic jewels. (You have to collect those to). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In some to wander around aimlessly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Oh, by the way, got the famous delayed title screen there.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But first of all, you got to do lots of leveling and getting the money and all that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because of the absurdity. Have monsters that are walking around you have to a lot of leveling, particularly fight them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that seems to be really a sign of an old-school R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It makes you do all your leveling first, then you can explore, as opposed to say "Final Fantasy" where you can kill the first boss at Level 2, and you can Level Up as you go along. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Quite frankly, after the ring got me a little five, I never even made it up to six. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently it takes about 500 Experience Points per level from levels five to 11. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I actually quit when I hit commit [only] an additional 131 Experience Points (because the monsters don't really give a whole lot of experience). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But really fighting is not fun this game you always lose like a quarter of your health each battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can [only] use your healing still twice if your M.P. is full. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's really not a very cool game, I'm afraid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you'd like tedious, painful to play Action R.P.G.s then loses your game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A point out that this does have a [pretty] good fan translations courtesy of Oh Tinchy Gani. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is translations way better than the game deserves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it is approachable, at least in terms of language. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Captain Tsubasa 🇯🇵 // Tecmo Cup Soccer Game 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 24 🇯🇵 // 1992 September [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tecmo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tecmo was known for making some [pretty] good Sports Games! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, this is one of the more unusual Sports Games for the N.E.S., "Captain Tsubasa". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, this is actually like no other Sports Game we've seen so far, since it's mostly controlled via menus rather than through normal means. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now Gavin's abasa is you probably already figured out a Soccer Game (or, as they call it in many parts of the world, 'Football' or even (God help us) Footy). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is based around a licensed property. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Captain Tsubasa is (I hope you're sitting down for this) based on a long-lived manga and anime series about a kid named Tsubasa ozora, who is naturally gifted at Soccer and had these amazing, almost supernatural Soccer playing abilities. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's funny and that's a recurring theme in the manga we've been seeing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A young kid who exhibits Heaven Sent talents and in particular field. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, there was a surekey g sim pie with fishing and pro Golf or sorrow with Golf. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tecmo did release this game in the West as Tecmo Cup Soccer, (a very creative name there). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Europe It was called Tecmo Cup football. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, all the reference to subox were removed and the intro is changed, and all the characters faces were altered. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The boss in particular became some sort of preppy douchebag named Robin field. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everyone seems to be depicted as some sort of blond, blue eyed arion type. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (I guess the localization team was confusing the U.S. with Sweden or something like that.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Coach in particular got a really ugly makeover. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, a few elements were removed; there's actually a side quest later on the game is not in the western version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, like I said, this is not a traditional Sports Game; it actually almost appears into R.P.G. territory, as your actions are selected the menu and then you watch them play out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you have the ball, you can run down the field using the D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To issue a command, you hit the B button and then you have options to pass shoot or return to dribbling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm looking at my pass options, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No one was very good So I just continued to dribble. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The stats are visible on the box on the right-hand side, so each character has like its own little stats for his different abilities. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now when you make a move, it might be accessible or the opposing team can block the ball or even take control of the ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, you don't control this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The outcomes are all like an R.P.G. battles (you know randomized with the stats figured in). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The one thing I couldn't really figure out is how to get your team to intercept when an opposing player has the ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Often they'll get the ball and just run your goal on a post. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The manual doesn't really say anything about this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As a result, often they'll try to score, your goalie will block, they'll catch The ball again, and try to score again and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can have your goalie try to catch the ball, but this almost always fails. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now Robin (or silvassa) is far and away the best player in the team and his kicks have a much better chance of getting past the goalie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He also has special moves like, for example, that ridiculous looking bicycle kick he just performed a moment ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you ever get one of those, there's a really good way to to get a goal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later in the game, you'll get some really powerful moods but he has to Level Up first before it can do any of those. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now sometimes your player will intercept an opponent with the ball and you can assign moves to stop him or to try to get the ball back (like tackle cut and so on). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, here the the outcomes are [pretty] random. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now if the game ends in a tie, there is going to be a what's called a penalty kick competition. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now as far as I can tell, it's it's [pretty] much pure luck. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You choose whether you want to kick the ball left or right, while the C.P.U. is goal is tied to either jump left or right and you know you do the opposite when you're guarding the goal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's pure luck. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You just have to guess left To write correctly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Better players like Robin can often get a goal and even if the goalie jumps in the right direction. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After the game, some players will Level Up, so to speak. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You gain experience from performing certain moves a lot during the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will cause your stats to increase between games, mentally, as I mentioned, leading to the specialty moves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so I've won the game, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the coach is telling me that these two characters are going to become better players. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is certain stats are going to increase. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, it's really kind of hard to know what to make this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's great that Tecmo came up with something completely different than all the other Soccer Games we've had. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you get used to the concept, I guess it's [pretty] fun to play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, the graphics animation in particular are really excellent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you run down the field and dunk the kick, everything looks very smooth. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the stylization using the characters movements make everything look really exciting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if you've never tried this game, I would definitely recommend it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sensha Senryaku - Sabaku no Kitsune 🇯🇵 // Desert Commander 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 24 🇯🇵 // 1989 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Kemco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 // Kemco | Seika 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, it's our last Japanese game from April (though we do still have a couple U.S.-[only] releases to check out). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is Sencha sunyac You saw buku no consuming (or 'tank tactics Desert Fox', also known in the West as "desert commander") from our old buddies Kemco. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let me assure you right away; this actually makes a lot more sense than "Superman". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though what doesn't make any sense is this intro. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Somehow that tank blew itself up? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's impossible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or maybe another tank shot that one. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, we have two play modes here versus the computer or versus the second player. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's one disappointing fact about "desert planner", Right off the bat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are [only] five campaigns. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, that's it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when we can't really compare this to a modern game like a "Warcraft III" or something, even compared to contemporary titles, that's kind of lame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Military Madness" had 16 distinct levels, each have two versions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The one nice detail, you can reallocate the number of units assigned to you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if you don't like a particular unit, you can drop it and get more units and something else instead. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you were cheating bastard, you can actually do the same to the CPUs units. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so what do we have here? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that military hat is your headquarters, and you'd have tanks, armored cars, infantry, artillery, anti-aircraft, guns, bombers, fighter planes, and Lane transport trucks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each unit has like a certain number of spaces, it can move per turn (depending on the terrain). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And train can also affect things like attack power. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And different types of units have strong or weak defense against certain other types of units. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if you've played modern Western type Strategy Games, you can probably just jump right in, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will make a lot more sense since then, like noise insane with its wacky battles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Don't you and the C.P.U. or other player take turns. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the C.P.U. moves much quicker than Fleet Commander (thank God!). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's actually going to try to use his bombers here, I think to soften up my ground forces. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I just happen to have my anti-aircraft gun handy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the battles are nice and quick - just a few moments of animated explosions, and then you'll see the results. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's none of those painfully protracted battles like annoying, insane, or that St. Gundam game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, maybe a wonder about the original Japanese version of the game, like what changes were made was brought over to the US? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's actually doesn't seem to be a whole lot different. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's the same -- same title screen, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And though I suppose the Japanese writing looks a little more badass. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Same intro, same number of levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, everything looks exactly the same as the U.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, so this really looks [pretty] much it identical to the U.S. game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Except... wait one second! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Holy cow! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You play the Nazis in this game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, Japan and Germany were on the same side. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That explains the name 'Desert Fox'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So apparently you are playing as Rommel's Afrika core. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, of course, in Military Simulation Games for computers you generally could play on either side. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like you play Rommel and Electronic Arts patent versus Rommel, for example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, Rommel is generally considered to be, sort of, a good guy since he did things like refuse to kill Jewish po W's. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, Nintendo of America and deadly would not approve the swastika and so it has been removed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the objective, by the way, is to defeat the enemies headquarters, which is completely mobile and can be moved around just like any other unit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've almost got them down to the wire, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, so as a few forces left, but I'm going to move Some of my guys in an attack his little blue headquarters, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And once you've done that you're when that campaign and you'll get a nice little cut screen showing the other team surrendering and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then it just takes us back to the menu and you can play another campaign if you'd like. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there's no overarching story to the game, just individual campaigns that really have like no historical context or anything - just like just five generic battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And strictly military tactics. I mean, there's no resources to capture, You can't build new units or capture towns. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though you do need to refuel from time to time, so you have to, sort of, make sure that there's like an airstrip under your control. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I'm going to call this the probably the most playable of all the Military Simulation Games we've seen so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's nothing spectacular original about it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's quite short compared to other games like battles and pullian. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But still, I mean, it's it's [pretty] usable in the menus all worked well, and it moves [pretty] quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So a good job Kemco, but still it's no "Military Madness". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Freedom Force 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sunsoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, we've got an awesome intro, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some [pretty] exciting musical startup in a second. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A mysterious dude with white hair and sunglasses blows the helicopter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Out. What does this have anything to do with the game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you read the manual it says nothing about anybody wanting to blow up helicopters or who this dude is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's almost like this was originally created for another game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, at any rate, this is "Freedom Force", a U.S.-[only] release from Sunsoft that utilizes the Zapper. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What this game is really about is this: Terrorists (or guerrillas as the manual calls them) have kidnapped hostages in an airport. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your job: shoot the terrorist and don't suit the hostages. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The characters job description is actually Terminator. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and enemies are described as bagman. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No Sunsoft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You've got it all wrong. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bagman are the guys in criminal organizations that transport money or goods. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They don't literally wear bags on their heads. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they're not the guys that would normally be given the job of taking over an airport holding hostages. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Where there's not really much explanation acquired and again like this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You shoot those guys for they shoot you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you get hit, your health will drop. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you shoot a hostage and error, the error meter will feel a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you lose all health or shoot me hostages, you die. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing I do wonder is why there are so many emergency ex doors on that plane. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And who closes the doors after you shoot the guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Something to keep an eye on is your ammo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If your ammo starts getting low, take a look at that box in the lower right-hand corner. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 An icon will occasionally appear, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Usually it's an hour We'll refill or even a different weapon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shooting the icon or video, whatever item happens to be in the box at that time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you have to be [pretty] darn quick as they show for [only] about a second. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now at some point, that level will just mysteriously and then you'll move on to the next one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are four regular levels And once you've gotten past level four, you'll go back to Level 1 again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll have to repeat the whole cycle a few times freak it's like the final fifth level, which is the bad guys main base or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One more thing about "Freedom Force": You [only] have one life. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you die once it's Game Over. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your life fire it's [pretty] decent size, but any attacks will often take off more than one chunk. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Grenades and machine guns, for example, take a huge chunk. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Doesn't sound that bad, except that it doesn't refill when you finish a level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In theory medical kits can be picked up by shooting them when they appear in the bottom corner they, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I say in theory because it seems like they never do. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When I took a look at the video for this segment, the [only] the medical kit actually appeared at the very beginning of the first level which doesn't make any sense because I wouldn't need any medical kits then. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then once (for like a split second in the middle of the first level). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And like so they flash on the screen so quickly have to be super quick. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So in practicality, you can [only] take a few hits for a regular Game Over. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, you have to be a really quick draw since having three guys shooting you at once is not uncommon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Freedom Force" I'm not really a great game - more like a pleasant time waster. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Major League Baseball 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atlus 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by LJN 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 LJN and Atlas are back the same team that brought you a "Karate Kid" and "T&C Surf Designs" now take aim at America's pastime. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What horrors shall be wrought? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a look. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, you know, the music is [pretty] catchy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Major League Baseball" is the name and we actually see the official Major League Baseball logo, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, for those of you in various parts of the world that don't know what all this hoo-ha means, let's clarify. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Major League Baseball" is a company that runs the two big pro Baseball U.S. leagues, the American League and the National League. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In order to use a real life pro Baseball team names you have to go to the MLB. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, the MLBPA "Major League Baseball" Players Association is a union for "Major League Baseball" ballplayers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Needed to get their permission to use the names of pro ballplayers in a game like Tengen did with "RBI Baseball". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Lj and haver just acquire the licensing rights from the MLB. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Therefore, they are able to call the game "Major League Baseball" and use the real team names though not real players names or likenesses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And back this is the first game to do so on a console since the Intellivision days. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So while all the teams are represented by their full names, the team members are just numbers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though they do all have distinct stats. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First thing to do is select your team and your players and then it's playball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So hey, this looks like someone ripped off the code from Namco Stanley stadium. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that couldn't be because this plays much worse than that game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, a "major league Baseball" is all kinds of terrible! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing that just bugs me is this swing mechanic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to like hold down the button to fully swing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Pressing it or not holding it down long enough will cause you to bunt. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, most of the game's problems rear their head when you're actually pitching or fielding. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Pitching controls are adequate though you can adjust location pitcher while he's on the mound. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, the C.P.U. will hit almost everything is throw at it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, building is impossible since you can't see where outfielders are until the ball actually reaches them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the kicker the ball seems to move slower than the runners - meaning the batter is probably already on first base by the time the ball reaches your filter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is a fly ball that just happens to land right in your first base Whether you happen to catch it, the batter is going to get to first safely. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You just can't throw a ball first quickly enough. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But really I shouldn't make any generalizations about the behavior of the ball in this game, since it does some really weird stuff, like sorta speed up and slow down in midair. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In a nutshell, the physics are wack in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you were to play "Major League Baseball", you're probably not gonna like it and so many tiny flaws all kind of add up to a really awful game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Did Atlas program this themselves? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Game Developer Research Institute has revealed that they did a certain amount of subcontracting to other people with these games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess doesn't really matter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way It's still you know, shame on Lj and. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shame on you to Atlas! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is definitely the worst Baseball Game we've seen on Nintendo Entertainment System so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Final Commando: Akai Yusai 🇯🇵 // Jackal 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 May 02 🇯🇵 // 1988 September [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, may 1988 is here and let's kick it off with an F.D.S. game from Konami. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! Konami's keeps kicking out the F.D.S. jams. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one is known as "Final Commando" a kaiyo cy (or 'Final Commando: Red Fortress'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The intro explains you'll need a pocketful of miracles and the ferocity of a wild bloody rose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's odd enough for a Konami Run-'n'-Gun to reference a Frank Capra movie but "wild bloody rose"? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, you saw your characters there just a moment ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what gets me is why it is called "Final Commando" if there are four guys? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which one is the so-called 'Final Commando'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, what we have here is a vehicular Run-'n'-Gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, a Drive-'n'-Gun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Look familiar? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it should, because it was based on this 1986 Arcade Game, known in the West as (wait for it), "Top Gun[ner]". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However the original Japanese title was to "Khushboo boo Thai jackals" ('special Horses jackal'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One major difference in the Japanese game your machine gun can shoot in any direction; in the U.S. version [only] shoots up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Europe, the Arcade Game was called simply "Jackal". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So naturally when Kami chose to release this cartridge in the U.S., did they use the name, "Top Gunner"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, "Jackal"! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note the character portraits have been changed up just a little bit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So to sum it up. 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese Arcade Game was "to cou shoot through Thai jackal". 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 FamiCom version "Final Commando: Kai yo Sai". 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 U.S. Arcade Game "Top Gunner". 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 U.S. N.E.S. name: "Jackal". 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 Makes perfect sense, Konami. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so what's going on here? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the U.S. version has a whole extra first level (a beach level much like the Arcade Game starts off with). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the bit with your Jeep being dropped off at cargo plane was also not in the Japanese version either. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this game you have two weapons a machine gun and grenades (both with infinite ammo). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your objective, aside from killing everybody, is to rescue the P.O.W.s found in those little huts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rescuing officers will upgrade your weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The grenades become missiles, which become quite powerful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, here we go! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First boss battle features for Super tanks (nothing too special here). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also new to the U.S. version are these crazy interlevel illustrations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Here?". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What does that mean? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The F.D.S. game just had boring loading screens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They also had these, uh, "Ghosts 'n Goblins"-like, uh, progression screens. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the second level in the U.S. version is the first level in the Japanese game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there's a major difference between the two games - levels are actually wider horizontally in the U.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The screen scrolls a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's quite a bit more extra stuff on the left and the right edges. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Jackal" is really a substantially different game than "Final Commando". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And both are very different from the Arcade Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't think these things were on the Arcade "Jackal" missile-shooting statues. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Skim good, [pretty] tough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing like being pinned down by a missile barrage and planes and Hulu VUDU and dropping bombs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the third boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Things with a bit tougher - giant aircraft carrier full of gunports (almost like a Compile boss or something like that). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to shoot out each of the gun courts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the boss battles always have enemy vehicles popping up at the bottom of the screen, just to make things a bit more difficult. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the structure of "Jackal" is this: 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are six levels; each involves blowing up surge of gates, blowing up some huts, collecting P.O.W.s, and dropping off the helicopter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Six levels total. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing too crazy or new here, but surprises do exist. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, you might be tempted to drive over the tracks to avoid the mines. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However suddenly a train comes rushing up behind you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Took me by surprise and killed me the first time I played "Jackal". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this game can be quite tough first time pick it up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like right there - there was a hut; naturally think there's P.O.W.'s but instead a particularly dangerous tank comes out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Jackal" does keep you on your toes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game gradually gets harder as it goes along. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Crossing bridges can get [pretty] hectic, especially when a bomber flies by. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though I'd say jaql isn't really that difficult until the very end of in the last level, and it gets brutal quite quickly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're approaching the final battle here, the enemy's main base. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last level is just a series of parking lots or landing scripts or something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But heavily fortified often with mountain guns that shooot a constant stream of bullets at ya. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're almost at the very end, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And suddenly the game throws in guided missiles! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can't shoot the missile silo from here, because those barricades are in your way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to get around the barricades and then blow it up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually quite frankly, amazed they got through this particular section one piece when making this video. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, extra lives aren't that tough to obtain, and you'll definitely need them at the end. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After dealing with missiles, ya pass through a gauntlet of mounted machine guns that are [pretty] damn hard-to-hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not really easy to aim diagonally and often That's the [only] way to take those things out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To avoid the constant attack from every single angle, you'll come face to face with the Final boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It turns out to be a gigantic fortress. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you're playing this here's a little tip: airplane will immediately dive bomb you the very start of the boss fight so mmediately take cover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so you've got gun shooting at you tank shooting at you and those black craters in the ground you actually can't drive over them so it's really easy to get stuck on those. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, this guy is basically the same boss as in the Arcade Game, same Final boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 How should you miraculously survived the total chaos and this boss battle, you will blow up the base and then there's a final final boss a giant tank (another spectacular and enormous Konami boss) armor the machine gun turret and a huge flame thrower. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A little hint: move over to one side so you can't get hit with a flame thrower. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you can, sort of, go up and down and throw grenades at the guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Give a lot of spare time As you can probably take a few risks otherwise play a safe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ventually the tank will turn orange then red then blow up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since we're almost, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah fantastic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Poros basketballs petals go the sons one was [pretty] tough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, if you're expecting a scene where you drive away and the bass blows up behind you, in typical Konami style, well unfortunately doesn't happen, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Hey, kids. What I want to do after defeating the forces of evil, reward myself with a nice relaxing cigar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, and, by the way, winners don't do drugs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So jackal is, sort of, "Contra" turned on its head. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather than the U.S. release being cut down. We get an expanded version with extra levels, between level bonus scenes, all kinds of little extras. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure the full game was developed and and content was removed or Make "Final Commando" fit on F.D.S. orbit was expanded to make jackal. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, the western version is clearly the definitive version and one of the classic titles for the N.E.S.. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Deep Dungeon III 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 May 13 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HummingBirdSoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Square 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh boy! an R.P.G. from square! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it's [only] another "Deep Dungeon" game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can tell the F.D.S. is now in trouble; Even 'Deep Dungeon' games are coming out on cartridges. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first two are published by the D.O.G. (a consortium small developers of F.D.S. games) but with "Deep Dungeon III" squared at a publishing it direct themselves as a cartridge. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So like the first two games "Deep Dungeon III" was created by Hummingbird soft and like the previous games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It is an extremely old-fashioned first-person Dungeon Crawler. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess square must, sort of, knock some sense of the guys Hummingbird soft as they have added a few Modern elements this one (probably very grudgingly). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First and foremost, you can now have more than one character, you can actually have four members in your party. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can choose from a whopping three different classes Hunter, monk and major. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so it's not exactly "Final Fantasy", but at least it's a bit of progress. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now when I called "Deep Dungeon", a Dungeon Crawler, I mean it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's all about the dungeons; you can never leave the dungeons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There now towns in the game, but the towns are also in a dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm no civil engineer, but shouldn't cities be built above ground, not inside a dungeon? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's really going to greatly impede growth and development of this town. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, you have your ins, shops, churches, all the standard 'Dragon Quest' "Final Fantasy" stuff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Except that because everything is a maze, it's gonna be much harder to get around than in most R.P.G. towns. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can't just walk to the end you have to walk around the maze and find it first. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Incidentally, while "Deep Dungeon" never came to the West we do have this very incomplete translation available which will show us most of the menus and whatnot in English. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So once you've got your armor (that's what I'm buying here)... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Silk? it's a bad choice of materials for armor! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So once you got all this stuff armor, magic, whatever, you actually have to find the exit to the real dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This might take you a little while. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (And learn the magic yet. Think you have to have more experience.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah, there's a ladder all right. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now we're in the the actual dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Boy that was quick! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Malas normal turn-based combat done through menus except for one thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Make sure you clip your armor weapons first, otherwise you'll get killed immediately. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure what was back in As the folks who design museums apparently had a very difficult time wrapping their head around the idea of easy to navigate menus. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here every time you quit something the entire menu closes seems to reopen it every every item you want to equip. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why not just have to go back to the previous menu, so you don't like you know, keep opening the menu over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why do they make these menus so hard? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Are they trying to make the game longer by adding cumbersome menus? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 See there whenever you equip something, the menu closes entirely. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so let's go and find some monsters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like so many old J.R.P.G.s "Deep Dungeon" has absolutely no problem of randomly throwing enemies that you can kill you in one hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I encounter these Skelton guys like literally 10 steps from the entrance to the first dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's games really make you appreciate just how playable the early 'Dragon Quest' and 'Final Fantasy' games were in comparison. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They don't really pull this kind of crap on you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wait a few minutes and Oh boy, these skeldon guys you'll Mark Round a rather nondescript dungeon and fight monsters, represented by little teeny tiny graphics inside that small box, the middle of the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's definitely not the best screen layout I've ever seen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will very slowly Level Up and you need to choose which attributes want to spend your points on the main level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So really "Deep Dungeon" resembles like old western style R.P.G. like "Wizardry" more than the contemporary Japanese R.P.G.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And as before, there's no, sort of, auto map so pen and paper for making maps is virtually required. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Random enemy encounters are disturbingly high. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't have to be moving to run to enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That you can actually just be sitting there and enemy will attack you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Want to finish the battle you will often encounter more enemies for you actually get a chance to even move forward one spot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To despite some teams being made to the formula, This still looks an awful lot like the first two games and it's not really a lot of fun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's keep our fingers crossed for "Deep Dungeon IV". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Meitantei Holmes: Kiri no London Satsujin Jiken 🇯🇵 ✨

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 May 13 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Another 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Towa Chiki 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Adventure Game time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Can you believe it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's been over two weeks since there's a Mystery Adventure Game for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We now have to a cheeky to thank this one, "Meitantei Holmes: Kiri no London Satsujin Jiken" ('great detective Holmes fog of London murder case'), starring the world's greatest ever cokehead detective, Sherlock Holmes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually got a nice little animated intro here (Though not much of one really). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A woman enters a door. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Presumably that's Holmes's house. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the plot concerns (guess what?) a rich guy has disappeared. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What a surprise. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 William Norton (some big shot) has vanished and his daughter Veronica wants you to find him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As always, we have the standard "Portopia..."-style interface, typical menu options, uh, Once we see them, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's 'move', 'talk', 'look', 'examine', 'call,' 'show', et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's been most The game yackety Yak came with various N.P.C.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most of these Japanese Mystery Games work this way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those of you with really excellent memories might realize is not to a chickies first Sherlock Holmes Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nope. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Back in 1986, we saw this little gem, which is more like an Action Adventure Game, Most notably forced eviction of British citizens is being heavily armed maniacs who go around firing guns randomly in the streets. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To what Chucky would release one last home game in 1989. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So going back to may 20 homes it does have one unusual feature. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather than moving around from location to location using the menu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You travel around on an overall map representing London. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've entered the times office, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As far as I can tell this although the locations are more or less correspond to where they would be in real life London at that time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can find political Scotland Yard, st Bartholomew's hospital, Baker Street and So on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now walking around is [pretty] slow. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you don't know where location is, it's [pretty] rough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you have the option of using a cab, which will actually take you directly to a specified location (though this does cost money, so you can't go to wild on cab rides). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's the cab location menu, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The production values on this game are really not too hot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note that the graphics that you see in the upper left-hand corner there (that sort of stands for you know, your first-person viewpoint) those are entirely monochrome. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To what cheeky is not really known for making great games And as far as I can tell, this doesn't have a real great reputation in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it should be pointed out this bill (or at least programmed) by the rather infamous company another the same guys behind "Hoshi no Miru Hito" Oh, he do, which was that super awful Sci-Fi R.P.G. we saw a while back. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know the one we were Hit Points weren't even displayed correctly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game seems more competently neighbor, Matt. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the exact extent of another's work isn't really known. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All we know is their name appears in the code. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Besides that, this is [pretty] much your typical Adventure Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kamen no Ninja Akakage 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 May 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Shoei System | Bear's 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toei Animation 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The magic words that make our hearts leap with gladness, totally animation and showy system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, it's another gym That wonderful team that bought us lights up couldn't okin. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Boy at the title screen looks kind of like the screen for coding Okay. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so what's this game based on you wonder? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, 'Kamen no Ninja Akakage' (or 'Red Shadow') was an old Toei T.V. show from the 1960s about... -- (well) it's about a mask ninja. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not just any mass Ninja, but probably the [only] ninja who ever wore a ridiculous red scarf. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (So much for blending into the shadows). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Akakage, you understand is not one of those, you know, sneaky ninjas. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But anyway, the reason that this game exists was because Toby had just put out an animated version of '...Akakage' on television. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So in this game, you do what you need to do, namely run down the street in broad daylight for no apparent reason. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, other ninjas try to kill you since you're [pretty] much a disgrace to the ninja profession. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, this is one of those games where you can just, sort of, keep running and the enemies won't really bother you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also we have a baby ninjas. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First boss is rather boring and just regular guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can take him out by equipping your throwing stars and just basically spam them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you've defeated him, Well, nothing happens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You just want to go on to the next level of no fanfare. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This boss is at least interesting looking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like a big transparent bird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess at this point We're officially at Level 2. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this more boring running past enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Keep calling these enemies here watch out for something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And just look at that they just completely vanished. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's [only] ever one type of enemy on the screen at once and when you cross like the invisible line and into this section with new enemies, any old enemies on the screen simply disappear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seems to be a problem but surely systems games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Superman deca three when you move into the area where new enemies would appear to recur could actually be frozen for a second. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Magnus is better than a coder no can enter the venda three but still it's a [pretty] lousy game in those regards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Made sure it looks less ugly than cookin but still there's [pretty] much zero thought put into such thing is level design and placement. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow! So a great episode we got going here today! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So far another makes an appearance, now showy system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe Tose and macronix, who also show up this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 The Chrontendo History of Adventure Games ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The next game we have up is a reasonably well-known Japanese Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I think probably now is a good time to have a brief history of the genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I assume that many of you watching are somewhat familiar with Adventure Games, but if not, I guess it's never too late to learn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like R.P.G.s it's possible to trace the history and evolution of intro games, and but it's [pretty] much impossible to write an all encompassing definition. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Generally, Adventure Games involve telling the story through the exploration and interaction with a well defined environment. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This may include puzzles, dialogue with N.P.C.s, and Inventory Management, but usually does not focus on fast-paced action, required reflexes, or manual dexterity to play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, early Adventure Games you don't normally engage in combat with enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So in other words, we aren't talking about these types of games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Games like "...Zelda" can be considered be Action Adventure Games, rather than Pure Adventure Games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# Part One: Adventure Games in the West: 1965 - 1988 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Adventure Games got their start on good old-fashioned mainframe computers and were originally strictly text-based. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Eliza ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most histories of the genre trace its origins back to an early attempted artificial intelligence called Eliza, which is a very simple little program designed by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966 (sort of a psychiatry simulation). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can converse with the program and it'll answer back, but it's very clearly just picking out words and pasting them into canned responses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's very easy to confuse Eliza by typing in weird comments, but it must have seemed [pretty] impressive back in the day, (I mean, actually talking to a computer). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Supposedly one day Weizenbaum walked in on a secretary pouring our heart out to the computer console. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Eliza was not a game, but it provided the basic idea for the Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He talked to a computer and answers back. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Colossal Cave Adventure ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the first true Adventure Game was "Colossal Cave adventure", also simply called "Adventure" or even "Advent". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Cred. The PDP 10 computer in 1975 by will Crowder. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Premise is simple you explore a virtual cave based on real life mammoth caves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game will give you a short description of your surroundings and then you would issue a command (say North for move one space north or get key to pick up a key). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It understood total about 100 new words, it was rough to phrase your comments in a way that computer will actually understand. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the game spread quite quickly in the computer programming scene and other people altered and added on to the game, putting in more fantasy elements like dragons and elves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Practically every element found in early Adventure Games has its origin here, including the maze described as 'you are in a maze of twisty little passages all alike'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not to mention the entire concept of exploring an imaginary world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also looking for items, picking up items, putting them into your inventory, and then use them to interact with the environments. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (For example, finding a key to open a door). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, this is all stuff that we take for granted like every single video A game out there today. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Adventure Land ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A few years later, commercial versions for computers began appearing, The first of which was "adventure land" released by a company called Adventure International in 1978. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Founded by a guy named Scott Adams, Adventure International was the first big player in the home computer Adventure Game genre. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Adventure ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other commercial versions of "Adventure" also included one released by Microsoft in 1981. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Adventure"'s influence extended well beyond the nascent Text Adventure genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oren Robinette at Atari is and make his own version of "Adventure" in 1978. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since a text game would have been impossible on the Atari 2600 a graphical representation was created. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Such innovations as multiple rooms, mazes, inventory, puzzles and rudiments plot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With all these things together, "Adventure" essentially created the Action Adventure genre and influenced, I guess, probably about every single Action Game we played today. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Zork: The Great Underground Empire ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Meanwhile, a group of computer geeks at MIT said make their own "Adventure"-style game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The result, "Zork", was so popular craters formed a software company, named infocomm, and released it commercially in 1980 for the Radio Shack TRS-80 computer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was a huge success selling around 400,000 copies and was, I suppose, the very first must-have Computer Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you think how many people had computers back then 4000 copies is actually very, very good. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Infocomm became the big player in the Adventure Game field, releasing various "Zork" sequels and remakes and hit after hit in the early to mid-'80s, such as "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "leather goddess of Phobos", and "Lurking Horror". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, as the text and Madrid games popularity waned, infocomm was bought up by Activision and eventually disappeared in 1989. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Pirate Adventure ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Scott Adams is also quite successful, releasing a series of texts through games such as "Pirate Adventure" (with its virtually illegible font) and "quest probe", there is a tie-in with Marvel Comics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, his game has featured very primitive text parsers and [only] handled Two word sentences. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing about this genre is they don't always play fair, it's often [pretty] easy to die. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here For example, all you have to do is move toward the window, you fall out and kill yourself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Adventure International went out of business in 1985. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Mystery House [Mentions: "Softporn Adventure"] ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what caused this shift and people's interests? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, in 1979, Ken and Roberta Williams formed a little company called online systems, As Roberta was designing a mystery themed Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The resulting game, "Mystery House", was released in 1980 in little homemade plastic bag packagings for the Apple II. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the difference was graphics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each area featured a little illustration (called a crudely drawn illustration) of what you are seeing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If there was a note on the ground You could see the note in the drawing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This revelation took the Adventure Game world by storm. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Suddenly, the all Text Adventure was replaced with illustrated text. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, one cute little feature of the game whether if you curse dead, it would actually kick you out of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's hard to believe that the Williams Were prudes because one of the right next game was called "soft porn adventure". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Hobbit ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the biggest hit of the era was 1982's "The Hobbit" from Melbourne house. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Known for its very colorful illustrations and its rather sophisticated text parser, it eventually sold a million copies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Melbourne house eventually change its name to 'Beam', released tons of crappy games for the Spectrum, and then start releasing bad games for consoles (like the N.E.S. 'Back to the Future' games). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Pawn ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So for a while, these kinds of games were enormously popular and companies from all over the world are making them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, magnetic scrolls from the U.K., here's one of their games called "The Pawn". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, it looks a lot like "the Hobbit". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing you may have noticed about these games is that it's [pretty] easy to die very quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, reading the letter will cause you to, sort of, die and start over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The try again reload or quit screen became a very common sight during this time period. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the Text Adventure Game just, sort of, chugged along for several years. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually getting the name interactive fiction to distinguish it from the more modern adventure style games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It still exists today is like an ultra niche genre with new game is being released, mostly non-commercially. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸King's Quest ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so what killed off the illustrated Text Adventure Game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well in 1984 online systems (now called Sierra On-Line) released a little game called "King's Quest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was an Adventure Game that use a traditional text parser. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you moved not by typing commands (like "go west") but actually moving your character around on screen, just like an Arcade or console game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even more amazingly, there was like a very primitive, sort of, 3D here, you could move in front of or behind objects, which were drawn in perspective. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Compared to say "The Hobbit" This is utterly mind blowing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, (guess what?) It's also incredibly easy to get killed in this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By today's standards, "King's Quest" is very clunky, unforgiving and really quite frustrating. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you try and playing with like a FAQ you're in gonna end up pulling your hair out before too long. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Too much of the game involves trying to find like little hidden items that are scattered randomly around the world. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than walking around all the other commands we're still entered in by typing in text. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One part of the challenge in any of these games is to get the computer to understand what you want it to do. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know what I mean? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, let's say you see something that looks like a staff type and take the staff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It applies. I don't know what a staff is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Take the rod, I don't know what a rod is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Take the scepter and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to figure out the right word for what you're trying to do. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sierra games are actually notorious For frequent deaths arising room something like opening a door, also unintuitive puzzles, and getting stuck in unfishable game if you neglected to pick up some object earlier in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the more notorious examples would be in "King's Quest IV". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not finding an invisible item hidden behind a rock will result in you not be able to make any progress later, since you can't go back if you missed that item. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Same thing happened in the first two 'leaders who Larry' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This makes here again Really exercises in aggravation for all but the very most patient players. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Space Quest: Chapter I: The Sarien Encounter ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well regardless of "King's Quest"'s faults, it was a huge hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's try to fold up with more games using the same game engine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There was "Police Quest", "Space Quest", "Leisure Suit Larry", "quest for glory" and they just kept pumping them out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And don't get me wrong; these are in many ways great games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just expect to see it your death occur very frequently and described by the game in loving, gory detail. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, once the introduced the graphical Adventure Game, it was here to stay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There was no going back to the older style illustrated text games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And car rule the roost for the rest of the decade. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# Part 2: Adventure Games in Japan: 1982 - 1989 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that about covers the origins of the Adventure Game genre in the West. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But what about Japan? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, old Japanese Adventure Games are a bit more obscure, often appearing on mysterious computer systems like the XM seven or the P.C. 6001. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the language barrier can be insurmountable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, let's take a look at what's going on over, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So when did the Adventure Game reached Japanese shores? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not sure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the home computer scene began in earnest in the very early 1980s. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Mystery House (Micro Cabin) ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of those early software houses was Micro Cabin. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1982 they produced a dumbed down ripoff of "Mystery House" for the NSE P.C.-88, called "Mystery House". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game at least had the courtesy to show you all the acceptable commands on the title screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There they are right there as a matter of fact. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the text parser was a little odd to say the least. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It could [only] take one word at a time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So to open a door you would type open and then enter and then type door. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It'd be introduced two simple commands. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, I guess it was a start and the graphics, I suppose, are not bad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And unlike the original "Mystery House", they're in full color. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though as we will see with many of these P.C.s eight games, the color always fills in line by line on these things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Guess it just the way the C.P.U. worked. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Mystery House (Starcraft) ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, in 1983, a legit port of "Mystery House" was released by a little-known company called Starcraft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not sure what that name is all about, but it has no relation I'm sure to the Computer Game that you all know and love. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was [pretty] faithful to the original though the art was all redrawn and actually improved. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you compare this to the rather funky looking house in the original Sierra game, it looks much better. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is difficult to play since like some of these other early titles you actually have to type in Japanese. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Dreamland ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now a lot of similar games so [pretty] much undocumented in the West appeared, for example, this one dreamland also by microcap and also from 1983. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this uses commands in the Roman alphabet, such as the traditional W, E and S for directions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What the game is about, I'm really not sure but it looks more like a cutesy style Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Princess tomato" salad Kingdom would be another example of the, sort of, cute, whimsical, silly style of Japanese adventure game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again notice the very primitive graphics. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken (PC-88) ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another company that was rather prolifically publishing Computer Games at this time was Enix. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1983, an extra Lisa game called "Portopia..." Renzo coos had susan g kin, designed by a young Yuji horii. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of all the games here, "Portopia..." was certainly the most influential copy Kicking off a mania for Murder Mystery Adventure Games in Japan, as viewers of 'Chrontendo' already know. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Plenty of these things at the market in the mid to late '80s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing that I believe that portobay is at least partially responsible for is the trend in Japanese games of moving away from exploring environment (like so many Western games walk around) to interacting with other people. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a lot of talking in Portopia. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Death Trap ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now a much younger company than Enix made their debut in 1984 with a game called "the death trap". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The company Square was just a handful of college students. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Among them was the game's producer, He wrote nobody sekiguchi along with later square stalwarts like hiromichi Tanaka. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Will: The Death Trap II ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it didn't do well enough to warrant a sequel will the death trap to, which was supposedly the first Japanese adventure Computer Game to feature animated graphics. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Incidentally, someone who wrote the Wikipedia article about death trap says that it sold 500,000 copies, but this seems a little unlikely to me. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Karuzawa Yuukai Annai ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Meanwhile, annex and Yuji horii pumped out two more Mystery Games, the last being karuizawa ukai and I. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken (FamiCom) ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By this point game designers in Japan were doing away with a clunky text parsers and instead allowing players to interact using the number pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Numbered options would appear along the side. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So instead of typing and talk, you hit the corresponding number. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, there's a little overWorld Map on this, making, sort of, an ancestor to "Dragon Quest". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By 1985 the Nintendo FamiCom was dominating the Japanese video game scene and once again, Yuji horii led the way, redesigning the number peg control scheme to work with the N.E.S. controller D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This became standard for console Adventure Games which [pretty] soon (as we know) flooded FamiCom. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Nakayama Miho no Tokimeko High School ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1987 even Nintendo was cashing in and released this curious little game called Nakayama Miho No tokimeki High School. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And aside from the typical adventure stuff, you need to engage in dialogue with the title character in order to win her heart, making this like a pro Dating Sim. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And just like in U.S. Adventure Games from people like Sierra, a single wrong choice could in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How very sad. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Maison Ikkoku ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sort of, see more romance oriented games such as Micro Cabins "may Sani koku" based on the popular manga. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was later ported to the P.C. Engine and FamiCom as well, but the P.C. Engine versions and translate into English so actually we'll see this game in more detail later on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What we're looking at here is for the MX two computer, which explains walgett graph Some sound are a lot better than most of the other Adventure Games we've been seeing so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But still, for the most part, most of these games that we've been seeing might be what they call aesthetically challenged, since the P.C.-88, which was the genre's main platform wasn't really that great it [pretty] pictures and noises. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Angelus ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As the '80s progressed, the P.C.-98 took over, and we started to see games that actually looked good and had Yeah, music Believe it or not, that was posted as little clicking noises. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And next after the citizen 'Dragon Quest' began, sort of, scaled back their P.C. game releases, but they did still release a few weird Adventure Games like "Angeles", which is about some reporters investigating the outbreak of a horrible new disease, and also has some random nudity as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game actually looks [pretty] creepy. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Snatcher ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now of all these games, this is the one that you're going to be most interested in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Snatcher", the 1988 game released for the P.C.-88 and the M.S.X. 2 design by Hideo Kojima. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is right after did "Metal Gear". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What we're looking at is an unofficial translation of the M.S.X. two version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, while "Snatcher" does use the typical numeric input to pick choices out of a menu, there's some action sequences, some shooting sequences in there as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What really, sort of, makes it take off is the high-quality of the graphics and the writing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It really, sort of, stands out from the crowd. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, this game actually looks really cool, and it's good to play as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like a cyberpunk style Blade Runner rip-off set in 1991. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Snatcher" was, I guess, deemed to have enough universal appeal to get a U.S. release a few years down the road on the Sega C.D., which looks -- it's the same game, but it's definitely a little prettier looking than this, but still, this looks [pretty] good for a Japanese Computer Game in 1988. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Rance ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now it should be mentioned that while adult games existed [pretty] much from day one on Japanese home computers (I mean even Enix made them) the adult Adventure Game really began to flourish around the late '80s (the the C.P. -- P.C.-98 it was capable animates tal graphics as we see here). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the most popular and long-lived series of these sorts of games was "Rance" (The first game coming out in 1989). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The publisher Alice top would become one more well-known producers of this, sort of, stuff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Rance" is actually, sort of, an Adventure/R.P.G. hybrid and would spawn numerous sequels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess that [pretty] much wraps up the first half of our Adventure Game history. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Second part, covering the Golden age of Adventure Gaming, will show up in "...Episode 32". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we'll see you then. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Conclusion: Back to our next game! ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now let's move on to our next game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Salad no Kuni no Tomato Hime 🇯🇵 // Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 May 27 🇯🇵 // 1991 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // Hudson 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah, here we are at last salad no Cooney no tomato Princess from Hudson (or as we call it, "Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the weirdest damn Adventure Game Ever and one that has developed quite a following over the years. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But isn't any good? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the game starts you off on the road to the Kini mountains to rescue the tomato Princess from the evil minister pumpkin (who is somehow allied himself with humans or terrorize the South Kingdom). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So hopefully go and immediately encounter one of the most beloved characters in videogame history, Percy that maybe persimmon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh my he's dying of thirst. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What a shame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily for him, there's a lake nearby. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Such a cute little thing, isn't he? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So once you find the lake So go ahead, get some water. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Travel back to Percy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Give them the water and he'll now become your assistant and best buddy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And sure, Percy is ridiculous looking but he's actually quite useful for despite being a persimmon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He is a mighty finger warrior, meaning he can play rock paper scissors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And plus Look at that face. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's so adorable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He just want to smash You know? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So move up on the road a bit you'll encounter his friends the lettuce King, who somehow made cover art despite being in the game for just one scene. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then there's all these goofballs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems that the human farmers are farmers are imprisoning vegetables in their farms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I would assume eating. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, no Percy is hated for many reasons, one of which at the end of each level, he'll tell you that he actually dropped or lost a number of items in the inventory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So naturally, you're like, great, I spent all this time picking up the stuff and then just like loses have it really. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You should be grateful for person because he actually [only] loses exactly the items which are no longer needed in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Many items are [only] used once or have no use at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Percy basically saves you the hassle of having to do any, any, sort of, inventory maintenance. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now moving along, we actually have a special treat, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a look at the original process tomato game released by Hudson for various Japanese computers back in 1984. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh my God, that's Percy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It looks like roadkill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This One ugly game though not without its charms. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's an old-school Adventure Game In the "Mystery House"-style you have typing commands like give water. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually a lot different than the more familiar ns game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The basic story is the same, but there's also stuff that was added when was ported to the N.E.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like there's no Rock Paper Scissors here and you may have noticed there's actually a sword in your inventory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the designs and settings seem much more Japanese inspired. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now aside from this was actually an HTML remake for the first level created by someone named Giovanni Fogg anello. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This featured some really [pretty] new art, but sadly is no longer available online. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 2008 The game is divided into nine discrete areas or levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you get to the end of a level you can't go back so it's very linear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point we've been captured by Sergeant Pepper, a green pepper turns red when he gets angry. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He locks you in a movie serial villain type torture cell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually you escape and horrifying terminal Go back and find the lettuce prints and the other vegetables have all been harvested - except for the watermelon who was too ugly to eat I guess. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] grim stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who also very soon experienced your first battles and that's what the the fight button is for. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it's not you it's Percy that does the fighting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, that's right Percy is basically your enforcer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This farm he bears a striking resemblance to Homer Simpson. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this fellow seems to think that coleslaw is made of cucumbers, oddly enough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That would actually be cabbage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Battles are fought as a game of Rock Paper, scissors (or jank, and as they call Japan). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Use the D-Pad to select either Rock paper or scissors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you win, you will then try to look the same direction as your opponent (also done with the D-Pad). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You just try to guess the direction is going to look. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Normally have to win several rounds in a row. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy is a salad drawn - sort of, a living bowl of salad including utensils, crazy stuff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They've actually never stood why human aura giant beasts like solid orange Actually, you know defer to a bed school after being defeated at Rock Paper Scissors. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole game is [pretty] weird but number of completely off-the-wall moments do stand out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here you found resistance base and you can actually meet this woman right here who is "Princess tomato" sister but the mind boggling thing is she's a human being. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The biological rules of this world seem to be [pretty] unorthodox, to say the least. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A moment later, we go to Lisa's room and Percy seems to indicate you should hit our. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A woman and a cucumber? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Box I guess I would prefer not to go, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One hidden gag: she has a hidden picture of Tom Cruise on her wall. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not to mention the fact that the inhabitants of the vegetable Kingdom seem to think nothing of eating vegetables are drinking vegetable juice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the case of peanut town, the roots are made out of peanut shells. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now so far I haven't really discussed whether the game is any good. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For those customers say LucasArts Adventure Games you will probably be a bit disappointed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is very linear but also the polls are not really based on logic instead Performing a series of actions in a certain order. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, there's a harmony to talk to. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now as HUD is just one screen away from this one, but the option to travel there does not apparently talk to the peanut guy on the left. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, there is no option to talk to him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not until you use the look option to get a description of the surroundings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even though you can see the guy, in the game in case there is no one to talk to until you look at him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You often have to look at the same screen or check the same object multiple times for you suddenly notice something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's not as much that you're solving puzzles as you're, sort of, trying the same options over and over again until you just happen to stumble across the rather arbitrary sequence of button presses the game wants to make. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like here, for example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When I first encountered this cave, there was simply not this exit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It simply wasn't, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's just just a wall. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Turns out I had to speak to Herman again and get some medicine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What the medicine is for I had no idea; it's not needed until the next level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But obtaining it makes your magically appear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no way you can know that before you need to get the medicine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is no logical connection between the metal In the hermit and the door. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if you can't seem to make any progress in the game, just look at everything again and talk to everyone again and hopefully something will unlock the passage or the door. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here's a rather infamous moment you discover the orange Princess taking a shower. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though she doesn't seem very concerned about this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 She calls you a pervert immediate, sort of, a flirtatious wink. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 She'll tell you that the Princess went on a walk in the garden, which really has no bearing at all on future events. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But until you hear that walk, she will not be able to progress Now in the next hallway. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or the all the doors are like locked or blocked until you actually go into that room, talk to the orange, and she gives you that completely useless little bit of information. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This doesn't really qualify as a puzzle, per se. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is the Princess herself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, children will tell you that much that's useful, but you have to talk to her. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After that you get to wage finger war on an eggplant and then go through the next door. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But again, it's like you encountered a lock door and the Princess gave you a key or something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather If you haven't spoken to her, the option for fighting this guy simply does not appear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game essentially says 'Nope, you're not going anywhere yet. Just keep wandering around until you do the right thing.'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's one more maze, more gencon battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually the Princess is rescued. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the pumpkin minister son appears for one last final battle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's been a caterpillar the the holding for like a couple levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Suddenly it comes in and you can throw it at him and he'll run away. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then finally the game is over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I should point out the the finger War (The Rock, Paper, Scissors) I mean, it's more or less just guessing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You, sort of, randomly push up, down, side, you know, whatever on the D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Certain dummies will have certain patterns, but it's just, sort of, you know, there's really no strategy involved is just, sort of, randomly hit buttons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, it's not a whole lot of fun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a look at just one last thing, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm just one scene from the original Computer Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I'll show you a shot of the tomato Princess. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As she appeared on the P.C.-88 version oh baby. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the Princess was de sexified just a bit for the console game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But really the computer and the console games are very different. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you really can't blame the N.E.S. games problems on being based on a 1984 Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since [pretty] much everything was updated or reworked. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are things to like about "Princess tomato". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The interface is very easy-to-use (even though it has commands like praise that are [only] used maybe once), the graphics are great, the premise is highly original, and lots of cool weird or reusing things happen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just you, sort of, solve the game by pressing 'look', 'check', and 'talk' over and over again until nothing new happens, then go on to the next screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it is quite frankly, the way many of these Japanese and retro games seem to work. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Trying to think logically [only] stuck. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I would recommend keeping a walkthrough and if you play this, because the game Rarely gives you any hints as to what to do. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But complaints aside, this is maybe one of the [only] Japanese Metro games from the FamiCom to get a U.S. release. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's Hudson's first foray into Adventure Games (or console Metro games) invested is a unique and a Board Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shogun 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 May 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Virgin Interactive 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hector 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, here's another odd one, "Shogun", from 'Hect' or 'Hector' or 'playing interface Hect' (as they describe themselves on the screen) - that just rolls right off the tongue. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Point time we've seen their name before was in a game called St. Seiya. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They were one of the co-developers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the first Hect-published game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might notice the title screen credit to Nippon Dexter and Virgin Interactive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it doesn't mention his name anywhere here But this is based on James Cabela's in 1975 novel, "Shogun" (you know, the guy who writes those huge historical novels about Asia). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Was made into a T.V. miniseries with Richard Chamberlain and to assure him a funi. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now you choose your character from like 30 different characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems like every single character from the novel appears, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And most of them are actually based on historical figures from the Sengoku era. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm gonna choose tomonaga, who is supposed to be based on Tokugawa, who mentioned, Of course, to become the Shogun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Number of these guys appeared in Nobunaga trebinje as well as you know all those other games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is one really ugly game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've entered my own castle here (I think). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm going to pick up some items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Can't just run over items and instead use the A button to bring up your command menu and select the hand option. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will pick up anything you run over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So about that Virgin Interactive credit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is (oddly enough) a port of a Commodore 64 game that came out in 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Version published this version, though master Sonic released it for other systems like a CPC or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it's sometimes called an R.P.G., It's really a side-scrolling Adventure Game - sort of, one of the descendants of Atari's "Adventure". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not a bad looking game, but clearly a lot was changed by Hect. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's been converted to, sort of, a typical top-down "...Zelda" R.P.G. style viewpoint, and the graphics have been completely reworked. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The icons for your actions are mostly unchanged However. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The icons allow you to pick up items (as we've already seen), as well as drop items, give items to someone else, befriend people, issue orders to your followers, fight people, save the game and look at the map. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The World Map is [pretty] useful; it shows you where all the other characters are. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, it shows you where you are as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the items you pick up tend to be either weapons armor or money, you know, that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object of the game has become Shogun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Supposedly, this is done by converting other characters to your cause and fighting certain ones that won't convert (or possibly bribing them). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Commodore 64 game, I guess is fondly remembered by the, sort of, folks who liked old Commodore games, but it looks, sort of, boring to me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For our purposes It's just another of those very rare cases of a Western Computer Game making its way to the FamiCom in highly altered form. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're going to see a battle here in just a moment. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's, uh, rather stupid-looking, if you ask me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really sure... I don't think you actually do anything in the battle; you, sort of, watch them you know bounce off each other. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I'd hardly call this a major release. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose who really want to play Shogun you might be better off playing the, you know, better-looking Commodore 64 version instead of this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Namco Classic 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 May 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Don't worry; the end is in sight. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But first here's the third game released on May 27th, "Namco Classic". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What? It's not called family Golf? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Boy, ya really dropped the ball there, Namco! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even the logo looks like belongs in a 'Family Sports' game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmm! The 'NPGA'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess that's the Namco Pro Golfers Association? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Pill "Namco Classic" is for one to four players. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you have, you know, a few different game options. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing you can do is you can either name your own character and select your own clubs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or you can choose a goofy looking character from the games roster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's what I'll go ahead and do, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmm. Quite an assortment! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's even the old asian guy character. Always see him in Fighting Games, as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think we go with a robot, (robot wearing glasses?). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And his name is Syed Pogo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmm! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you have your character selected, and then have the opportunity to enter in a handicap, so if you're like a real life golfer, you can, sort of, tailor the game to you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I'm gonna make the same complaint about "Namco Classic" that I make about every single Other Golf Game we've seen on 'Chrontendo' so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They are all the same! (same controls same graphics, same swing the club and hit the ball mechanics). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh no wait, I take that back! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one uses a circular Power Bar, not a straight Power Bar. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, unlike that 'Jumbo Ozaki' Golf Game, there is an indicator on the Power Bar to help you know to press the buttons at the right time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (In Jumbo Ozaki's game, you actually had to watch the Golf club and do your button presses based on that!). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But other than that, it's really just like all of Nintendo's Golf Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why doesn't someone make (I don't know) a miniature Golf Game or a Golf in space game or something that's different than what we've already seen dozen times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I know I say this every single time but I'm getting tired of all these damn Golf Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing that's a little bit different areas, one to actually you know, get your ball out onto the green, you can't use a wood club; ya have to switch to one of the irons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most games will let you use whatever club you want all the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than that, it's just the same old story. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 31 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully that was worth the extra wait. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next episode on the other hand will hopefully be a bit more on time and we are going to have the second half of look at Adventure Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Plus a game from Konami, a game from Capcom, and a game from Sunsoft (that you all know and love). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, we're going to have a debut from a little company that we like to call Hi Tech Expressions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we'll be looking forward to that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 See you next time. 🍇🍌
