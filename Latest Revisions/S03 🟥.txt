👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chronsega Episode 3 ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, we've gone ahead and put together another episode of 'Chronsega' as the companion piece to the main 'Chrontendo' series. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "...Episode 2" saw a really good (though not perfect) game for the Master System, "Alex Kidd in Miracle World". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, nothing in "...Episode 3" really quite reaches the stature of that game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 What we do have here is a few Arcade ports (including one very good title). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also several Sports Games, a few Western Light Gun Games, an attempt at a "Metroid"-type game, and even an 'Alex Kidd' release (sort of). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 All of this will take us to the first half of '87, catching up to where we are on the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, let's get started! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Woody Pop 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you might remember from "Chronsega Episode 2", [only] two titles were released in Japan in the first two months of 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (That was "Quartet" and "...Loretta no Shouzou".) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, uh, in March, things start picking up a bit, with a total of five games released! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 First up is "Woody Pop". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You know, we just covered a FamiCom game called "Woody Poco". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, it's "Woody Pop". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's a good thing it was not released in the U.S. with that title. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise, it would have sent a legions of school boys into snickering fits. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But it's called "Woody Pop", because, you know, your character's made of wood. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And... well, I guess I don't really know what this is about. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Apparently you play a plank of wood! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Does this look, sort of, familiar? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Does it maybe look a little like "Arkanoid". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, Taito released the home version of "Arkanoid" for the FamiCom and Konami released a clone just a couple months prior. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, Mark III owners in Japan could enjoy their very own "Arkanoid" clone. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Regrettably, I can't play this game, because it requires a special paddle controller. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The gamepad will not work. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, this is just the demo mode. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 {That's} a shame because it's a nice-looking game and it's actually [pretty] cool to play. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It} looks a bit more wild and crazy than "Arkanoid" (or even the Konami game). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Little things you shoot, little soldiers come marching out - all kinds of crazy stuff. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess if you have a paddle, this would be a [pretty] cool game to play. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, the game does, sort of, plays in history for one reason. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You might remember that when Sega launched the Mark III in Japan all the games came out in the My Card format. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Woody Pop" is the 14th and last My Card game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 From this point out, it's going to be cartridges [only]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Wonder Boy 🇯🇵 // Wonder Boy 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Westone | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alright, let's get on to our first playable game this episode, "Wonder Boy" - the game that launched 1000 sequels in ports. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, not that many but there is an unusually Byzantine history behind this game in theory spin-offs (um, probably more convoluted than almost any other game in human history). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {I} don't have time to explain it here because it's already been explained in great detail in "Chrontendo Episode 10". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For the moment, let's just mention the facts behind the original game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Wonder Boy" began life in 1986 as an Arcade game released by Sega, but developed by a company called Escape (better known as Westone). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (This is the original Arcade version here.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The very first console port was Sega's S.G.-1000 (the predecessor to the Master System). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This rather ugly version is, uh, sort of, done in by the S.G.-1000's hardware limitations and is just barely playable. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also, Westone licensed the game to Hudson Soft, released it with altered sprites and characters as "Takahashi Meijin no Bōken Jima" (or, as it was called in the U.S., "Adventure Island"). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sega [only] owned the character designs and names - not the game itself. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Again, uh, this was covered back in "Chrontendo Episode 10". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Finally, we have this version here for the Master System, the first really accurate port. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In fact, uh, this game looks very close to the Arcade version. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Master System couldn't reproduce quite as many colors. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But when it comes right down to it "Wonder Boy" is probably about the closest we've seen to an accurate Arcade port in recent video game history. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sure, early FamiCom releases like "Donkey Kong" and "Pac-Man" were [pretty] accurate but, uh, since then the advances in hardware meant Arcade games couldn't really, uh, be reproduced on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Even most Master, uh, System games took some liberties (like "Fantasy Zone", for example). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But the SMS "Wonder Boy" really succeeds in capturing the look and feel of the original Arcade game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One bizarre change: your jump doesn't carry you up high enough to get the fruits that are near the top of the screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ya need to hold the Run button, then jump. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In other versions, you can simply jump a little higher and grab those fruits up at the top. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also, the pace has slowed down a bit, compared to the Arcade version, as your life bar decreases at a much slower rate. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... For those not familiar with the game, grabbing the fruits will increase your Life Bar. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once it runs out, you, uh, die of hunger. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, one of the many things you can find at the game is a skateboard. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, taken by itself, how does "Wonder Boy" stand up as a Platformer released in early '87? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, [pretty] damn good! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... After the release of "Super Mario Bros.", tons of side-scrolling Platformers were -- uh, came out ([only] a handful of which were any damn good at all). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Here's the, uh, the boss right here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You fight him in some sort of castle scene. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Didn't some other boss also live in a castle and throw fireballs? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Wonder Boy" has a much more gruesome fiery death than "...Mario..." ever had; that's for sure. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And once you defeat him, his head comes off! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One of the, uh, major issues with this is it, sort of, does suffer a bit in, uh, variety of gameplay. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's [only] a few different locations, uh, (jungles, ocean, caves). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And while the layout is different each time, uh, it does feel repetitive after a while. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "...Mario..." also use repeating environments, but managed to mix it up a lot better. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, despite some reservations, "Wonder Boy" is still a very cool game and really a highlight of this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Great Volleyball 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, out of the blue comes three more games in Sega's so-called 'Great Sports' series. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Back in 1985, Sega released a few games "Great Soccer", "...Baseball" and "...Tennis". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They then seemed to put the series on the shelf for a while before releasing "Great Golf" in December of 1986. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the series is back with a vengeance. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 First up is "Great Volleyball" which bears (How shall we say this?) a certain resemblance to Nintendo's "Volleyball", released in Summer of '86. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's a few different modes. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Training will let you practice serving and spiking. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you select, uh, competitive mode, you choose your team from international roster (again, much like the Nintendo game). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You then get some points which you can, sort of, uh, you know, apply to your various attributes. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As for the controls, and the gameplay, and, uh, presentation, it's basically just a clone of the Nintendo game, meaning I didn't like it and had a hell of a hard time spiking the ball. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Wow. So it's this early into the episode and we're already getting our first Sega-induced taste of disappointment. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, you know, what, it's [only] gonna get worse with these next two games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Great Basketball 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the second game in Sega's little run of Sports titles is "Great Basketball". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This might look a little familiar to you. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, of course, we saw it in "Great Volleyball" as well. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once again, you can play against the C.P.U. or another person. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Select your country and the national anthem plays. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, "Great Basketball" does stand out due to one factor. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's the first Basketball Game we've covered in 'Chrontendo' or 'Chronsega'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yes, Sega introduced Basketball to the 8-bit console. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Or well, maybe they did. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Atari also released a port of the Computer game, "One-on-One", for the 7800 around the same time ({I'm} not sure which one actually came out first). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 While Basketball Games have been around for a while and existed on the 2800 and Intellivision and so on, you might say the genre really, sort of, hits maturity in 1984 with Konami's Arcade game, "Super Basketball" (Konami becoming [pretty] much the, uh, publisher for Arcade Basketball Games for quite a while). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sega themselves released a rather weird (though technically impressive) Basketball Game, "Dunk Shot" in 1985. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The top-down perspective is [pretty] strange... but we'll actually, uh, see another game kind of like it a little later in this episode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Dunk Shot!". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And of course, Konami's "Double Dribble" from 1987 set the standard for Basketball video games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Double Dribble" will end up having a FamiCom release in very near future. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, the only game that "Great Basketball" most resembles is Konami's "Super Basketball", right down to the green floorboards. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Considering that "Super Basketball" is probably the most prominent Japanese Basketball Game at the time that Sega was developing "Great Basketball", I guess that sort of makes sense. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I suppose that in terms of controls, "Great Basketball" is [pretty] standard (one button to pass, another to shoot). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Teams are [only] four players. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 {} 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing about this game is it's quite easy (too easy, in fact) to get a foul. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 When I was playing, the both teams fouled constantly (either charging or pushing). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it seems that every time the player with the ball comes in close proximity to another player, a foul is gonna occur. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Oh and, of course, you also get this cute little halftime show here.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it seems if you just wanna take control of the ball, all you really have to do is move your player in front of the other team's player and, 'Blam!', he'll get a 'Charging' foul. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 While this game looks [pretty] decent, it does seem to be, sort of, widely panned by Basketball aficionados. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The whole package is, uh, [pretty] mediocre and seems to be, sort of, typical of the whole 'Great Sports' line. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Great Football 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And... here's the last one, "Great Football". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 What an ugly logo! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It} looks like the 'A' in 'FOOTBALL' is made out of a pair of bellbottom blue jeans! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing that did take me a little bit aback was the use of the AFC and NFC as their choice of leagues. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I can't believe Sega officially got the rights to use those. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I [only] assumed they figured the letters AFC and NFC were generic enough they wouldn't get in any trouble. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And all the team names are made up and somewhat ridiculous (like the 'Boomers'?). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, Football is a difficult game to convert into video game form - at least it was back in the 8-bit days. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Irem had done so with "10-Yard Fight", which was actually a launch title for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the U.S. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That was a very simple but, uh, a [pretty] fun game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Great Football" is not so fun. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the 2-Player version makes a bit more sense. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But when you play against the C.P.U., well, the weird thing is you always have control of the ball. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The C.P.U. never plays offense. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Instead, it just gets like some random number of points and you need to beat its score. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But you never actually lose control of the ball. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You do have the ability to select between fo... -- eight formations. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The cursor will move through all eight (slowly), and you need to press a button to choose which one you want. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But there's no indication on-screen when you make your selection. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is obviously useful in the 2-Player mode so the other player won't know what move you're choosing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the C.P.U. mode, you just, sort of, slows the game down a little bit. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, one big problem: Your quarterback has a hard time throwing to the receiver. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You do get a lot of incomplete passes. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the event that your receiver does catch the ball, you might make some decent yardage but the C.P.U. will always run faster than you. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Another thing that's somewhat irritating: If you do manage to get to the end zone, your player just stops. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You do score a touchdown, but for some mysterious reason you freeze right on the zero yard line. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess when this happens, it does look a little bit ridiculous. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I suppose there is a lesson for Sega in all this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 None of these games is as fondly remembered today and back then they certainly did -- didn't do much for the Master System's sales in Japan or here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I really question the wisdom of releasing all three on the same day. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That just screams, 'Hey! Here's some cheapy shovelware just so we can get some more Sports Games on the system!'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the fact that these games all, sort of, c... -- share certain things in common... (like, uh, you know, the whole lot select your team bit on "...Volleyball" and "...Basketball") ...it gives the impression that not too much effort was put into developing individual titles. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 After this, Sega did release a few more games in the 'Great Sports' series, but eventually dropped the whole thing. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Great Football", however, did find a second life as "Sports Pad Football". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The exact same game was rereleased, except that it could be used with Sega's trackball-like Sports Pad controller. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sukeban Deka II: Shoujo Tekkamen Densetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 April 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Warning! This game may induce seizures. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay. "Sukeban Deka II...". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I know what you're thinking. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'What, what, what? Where's "Sukeban Deka I"?'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 What's up with all these schoolgirls? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, let me explain. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Sukeban Deka' was a serial manga by Shinji Wada that ran back in the 1970s and has been turned into a never-ending torrent of spin-off TV shows, cartoons, movies, records, toys, etc.. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Sukeban Deka II' was the second TV series and was on the air in the mid-'80s. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Sukeban Deka' concerns (naturally) Japanese delinquent schoolgirls who have turned to fighting crime. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Much like "High School! Kimengumi", it plays like a mash up of an Adventure Game and Action Game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Though, in this case, that works out to "Portopia" meets "Renegade".) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Remember, of course, that the original Japanese version of "Renegade" concern High School gangs. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The big gimmick in {the} 'Sukeban Deka' franchise is that the heroine fights using this crazy weaponized yo-yo (much like in "Rygar"). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This game alternates between menu-based Adventure sequences, where you poke around the High School, trying to solve some sort of mystery. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 With these low-grade Beat-'em-Up levels, followed by one-on-one boss fights. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... The boss fights remind me a lot of those in Sega's "Hokuto no Ken" game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As far as I can tell, your character [only] has one attack (namely, the yo-yo). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, don't expect any "Double Dragon"-style excitement here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The 'Sukeban' franchise is still around to this day. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In fact, a feature length film came out a couple of years ago. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Kinda a bit of trivia for fans of Japanese pop culture) it was directed by Kenta Fukasaku (the son of the legendary Kinji Fukasaku). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Kinji Fukasaku made many many films but kids [today] probably know him best as the director of "Battle Royale". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Going a bit deeper, old bastards like me might remember him as a director of the "Star Wars" rip-off "Message From Space", footage from which was used in Sega's LaserDisc Arcade game, "Astron Belt". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Rocky 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 April 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The second of our two games released in April is "Rocky". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is one technically impressive opening sequence. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Giant gold-plated "Rocky" logo goes into the rather nicely done portrait of Stallone, taken off the, uh, "Rocky IV" movie poster. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This really shows the, uh, Master System's graphical prowess. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nice details like, uh, the shiny reflections on the gloves. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, "Rocky" is (not surprisingly) a Boxing Game - and one that sort of gets off on the wrong foot, with a rather obnoxious opening training minigame. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yep! It's "Track & Field" time! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hit those buttons as quickly as you can and for a solid minute. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once your fingers are nice and cramped up and need to rest, then it's time to play the game itself! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Rocky" is a [pretty] nice-looking game; I'll admit that. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {You} certainly can't get sprites that detailed on the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They're [pretty] solid looking! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 {You} start off f... -- fighting Apollo Creed from the first two movies, then you move on to Mr. T from "Rocky III" and then Dolph Lundgren from "Rocky IV". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Rocky IV" had been released in 1985, so this tie-in wasn't exactly super timely. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As far as Boxing Games go, I'd place it between "Ring King" and "Punch-Out!!". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It's} not terrible but not exactly brilliant either. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It} doesn't really make great use of the screen real estate. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Your characters are about [a] third as tall as the screen height. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yet the bottom section is completely wasted. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the top half is, uh, taken up by that gigantic display - a lot of, uh, dead space, vertically speaking. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Controls are weird and not really that friendly. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Use one button to punch and the other to block or duck. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I personally really wanted to use the down button on the D-Pad to duck. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That'd be a lot more intuitive. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you get knocked down, you have to, sort of, hit your, uh, button repeatedly real fast in order to get back up again (kind of like in "Ring King"). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 (I kno... -- knocked down Apollo here.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you land a few punches in a row, you can create combos that end in a more powerful punch. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game plays about the same as "Ring King". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... When your power bar drops you get knocked down. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This was released in both the U.S. and Japan, um, but I assumed it was actually designed for the U.S. market in mind. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Remember, Sega was releasing games, uh, for the U.S. quite quickly... (Ah! Here's another training sequence) ...and really focusing on the U.S. market. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Despite those ridiculous button-mashing training sequences, "Rocky", I guess, is sorta decent. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though it certainly would be overshadowed, uh, like, by future Boxing Games like "Punch-Out!!", in the near future. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here, I'm fighting Mr. T. - {a} much tougher opponent as you can see. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Which brings us to another issue - there's [only] three opponents! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is a, uh, [pretty] decent try from Sega. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Makai Retsuden 🇯🇵 // Kung Fu Kid 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 May 17 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Moving into May we come to "Makai Retsuden", which is Japanese for 'wasted opportunity'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, it really means something like 'Demon World Story'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [You will], of course, recall the Japanese title of, uh, "Ghosts n' Goblins" was "Makaimura". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, it gets off to a good start, with that rather, uh, sweet-ass title screen we saw there a second ago... but then it kind of goes downhill from there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 By the way, this was released in the U.S., under the rather generic name of "Kung Fu Kid". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Back at this time, they would take any game with, like, an Asian theme and just, sort of, automatically put the word 'Kung Fu' in the title. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, once we start playing the game, we'll see that, 'hey, it's a remake of the old FamiCom "Fist of the North Star"! (or maybe Sega's own "My Hero")'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Enemies come pouring out from both sides and you just, sort of, kick them repeatedly. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Very nice. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here we get the first boss. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Some sort of, uh, Kung Fu monk, I suppose. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll figure out it's easier just to jump over all the enemies or run away. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's always a sign of great game design. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, actually, the bosses really aren't that bad (at least not compared to the rest of the game). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They usually follow some sort of pattern you need to figure out, so they aren't just, uh, simple, you know, button-mashing fests. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you get past the first couple levels, the game does pick up a bit, uh, there's a little bit of Platforming. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have kind of a cool little double jump (not seen very frequently, back then). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I guess any game that features Chinese hopping vampires is [pretty] cool. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But overall "Kung Fu Kid" tends to suffer from lackluster gameplay. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it's a crying shame, because "Makai Retsuden" really feature some [pretty] amazing graphics in places. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure what those little doll guys are! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They're, like, some sort of puppet. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Rather annoyingly, they take couple hits to kill! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Oh, yeah! And what's up with the frogs?). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 See? This is exactly what I mean right here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just look at that dragon! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is one good-looking game! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Definitely, uh, one of the best-looking console games we've some... -- seen so far. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They really know how to, sort of, use the vibrant color scheme of the Master System! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, uh, Sega is, uh, really sort of, I guess, improving [at] least [in terms of] graphics for the system, but, uh, the actual gameplay could use a lot of improvement. 🍇🍌

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alright, "Enduro Racer". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, we're getting some classic Sega Arcade action here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sega has been a little Scrooge-ish with porting its huge Arcade library. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But "Enduro Racer" is some top-tier Sega. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The 1986 Arcade game (seen here with its badass logo) is Yu Suzuki's follow-up to "Hang-On" - [only] with a dirt bike theme. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Again, amazing sprite-based 3D effects! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You actually pull up on the handlebars to do a wheelie. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, there was a, uh, another Sega hallmark: awesome explosions! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yeah! There we go. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} certainly looking forward to the Master System port. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a look. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 What the hell? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, this is certainly not "Enduro Racer". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They've turned it into an "ExciteBike" clone! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is utterly ridiculous, as "Enduro Racer" was ported to countless Computer systems and kept the [3D] perspective. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Even the goddamn Spectrum version attempted to replicate the Arcade version! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Why did the Master System get this? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess, (based solely on its own merits, uh) the Master System "Enduro Racer" is okay -, sort of, similar to "The Circuit" (a.k.a. "World Grand Prix"). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You get points based on your performance, and then you use the points to purchase upgrades or repairs for your bike. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It actually takes damage every time it hits an obstacle. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 At this time, Racing Games were starting to, sort of, advance beyond the simple 'Beat the Clock' style of game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nowadays, of course, they'll have unlockables and customizable vehicles and whatnot. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But the idea was still in its infancy at the time. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here, you see the results, and then [it'll] give you an opportunity to spend some of your points. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Item' is, uh, repairs, by the way. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is the Japanese version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, the U.S. version was an even bigger disappointment. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The title screen and the map that you get at the end, showing how far you actually made it, were removed. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Several levels were either, uh, removed entirely or reshuffled. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It also seems, uh, somehow easier. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. version was a [pretty] serious hack job on the original game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The ROM was [only] about half the size of the Japanese version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it had some really lousy box art! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I can [only] imagine how disappointed "Enduro Racer" fans were, especially in the U.S.! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Akai Koudan Zillion 🇯🇵 // Zillion 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 May 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, Sega begins this game with a tribute to the 1903 film, "The Great Train Robbery"? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess this proves just how cutting-edge "Zillion" is. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Make a note of the ray gun design featured on title screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We'll discuss that later. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Zillion" is Sega Sci-Fi epic - their attempt at a "Metroid"-like game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 We start with these expeditionary text boxes, and they actually, sort of, give you the game instructions, as well. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I love the fact that this Top Secret data is stored on floppy disks. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And apparently their main base computer has an executable *'Explode'* command built-into it. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you're rescuing 'Champ' and 'Apple'? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Are these people or your pets? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 What about Prancer and Mr. Whiskers? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Are you going to rescue them too? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously these, uh, character names are, sort of, superficial aspects of the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But come on seriously, would "Metroid" have been quite as cool if, uh, Samus Aran was named 'Apple'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, to be fair, this might not be Sega's fault - because it's not clear they actually created these characters. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Zillion" is based on an animated series from Tatsunoko Production. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The whole thing was an attempt to create some sort of a cross-platform synergy, with a TV series, a game, and also a toy gun - all out at the same time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The gun is depicted in great detail on the title screen. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, as is the convention, you descend into the enemy base, find your way to the core, and then blow it up. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, here's the catch: Each room you enter has a computer terminal. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You need an ID card to use it; luckily, there's one just lying around. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You blow open those storage containers found in every room. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Each room has at least four and those each contain one character of the password. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You also find, uh, more ID cards or the occasional Health Refill or power-up. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just shoot the container, press up on the D-Pad, and they'll show you the 'key word', as they call it. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you've found all four, you can enter it into the computer. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It} doesn't matter what order the characters are entered in. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This will open up the door {to} the next room. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally you'll trigger an alarm which will send a group of guards rushing in. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you've typed the code in correctly, one - or sometimes two exits will open up. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, these are all, sort of, like numbers with mirror images of themselves. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so (as you can... just probably barely notice there) a little elevator has opened up in the top left-hand corner. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'll use that to go on to the next room. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is a dead end, as you can probably see by the solid walls (and by the fact there's less than four containers). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You need to get a stronger gun before you can shoot those, uh, smoother looking containers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I just found the goggles that allow you to see the alarm sensors. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (It's that little -- little yellow line there.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You may have noticed some aspects are very similar to "Metal Gear". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You find special goggles that allow you to see the sensors in that game as well, not to mention all the ID cards. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And of course, uh, "Metal Gear" came out about the same time as this one (uh, for the M.S.X.), um, so there couldn't be any direct influence. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's one of the game's more idiotic moments. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Guards just, sort of, drop down from the ceiling. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Don't expect much from the enemies in this game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, about the ID cards: [if you use them to] open doors, you'll get your ID card returned. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, you'll also need them to input special commands occasionally. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And you don't get your card back after that; so it uses one card. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, I'm gonna enter the code to turn off the electric forcefield. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I need to get up there to get the passwords. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, the game lets ya know all the special codes in the introduction. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, if you don't have a manual, it's still playable. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can shut off the barriers, stop moving sidewalks, uh, turn off gun turrets, and so on, but [only] for a very brief time, so you have to seriously hurry after using the card. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Thus, cards are, sort of, like the currency in the game! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You're always finding more cards but you, uh, can use them too quickly or otherwise you'll run out. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the controls... 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... First of all, it really should not be this hard to jump over landmines. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you were expecting a Samus Aran-like character who's, you know, uh, easy to maneuver and can fire lasers with deadly accuracy, well, J.J. (that's his name) is not that sort of guy. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And check this out. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is actually, sort of, looking forward to "Metal Gear Solid II". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This is Japanese video game emo, in its embryonic form. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Eventually you'll find weapons upgrades that allow you to shoot tougher containers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... But, of course, you better remember where they are, because you'll have to come back to them later. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's one right there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, other than the controls, here's "Zillion"s major problem. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 While the idea of grabbing codes and entering in the computer to unlock doors is kinda cool at first, I can [pretty] much guarantee it will get real tiring real quick. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 By the way, we're going to come across Apple here in just a moment. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 She's, sort of, frozen in carbonite or something up in the corner there. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you free her and Champ you can switch back and forth between the characters, but they need to be Leveled Up separately, including their weapons. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Level Up items are scattered around here and there - and they're actually shaped like OPA-OPA from "Fantasy Zone". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 He also has some, sort of, uh, camio appearances in the anime as well. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, going back to this game's major problems. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You might think, 'Okay, cool. So, um, you know, when do we enter the next world or whatever?'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, the answer is never. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is actually the entire game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Enter the room, shoot the guards, avoid the traps, and get the codes, type into the computer, and then repeat. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's no lava levels, no mid-bosses, no new enemies - just different variations on the same room over and over and over again ...for a total of 75 rooms. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ah! We've just now rescued Champ (the ungrateful bastard). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One kind of cool thing about "Zillion" is that it actually, sorta, looks forward to the "Final Fight"-style Beat-'em-Ups by having a classic, you know, strong-but-slow character, fast-but-weak character, and then the-balanced-character lineup. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And another major bummer about "Zillion" is that there are no saves and no passwords. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have to complete the entire game in one sitting. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 About halfway through the game, you'll probably experience some sort of mental breakdown due to having to get the codes over and over and over again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, by the end of the game, well, you will hate those damn codes. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I started off memorizing them but, uh, by the end was too mentally damaged to continue doing so. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so you get all the way through the base and you find the last disk ...or is it? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh wait! What about those containers you couldn't break much earlier in the game? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I hope you remembered where they were, because now you've gotta go back and find 'em. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Actually, a little shortcut here allows ya to warp back to the beginning. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, now basically [you], sort of, have to forward-track back [to] those levels and find any containers that you might have missed, in order to get that last floppy disk. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you're back here at the other side of the maze, you then set the computer to self destruct. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, you'd think they would put in some kind of, 'Are you sure you want to blow up the base?' confirmation screen (you know, just in case). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Don't know why you need your ID card after you've just set the base to blow up. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You then fight the game's [only] boss whose, uh, little blue fireball things they actually cause your characters [to] actually turn around 180 degrees in a rather annoying fashion. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And then, of course, (much like "Metroid" and "Metal Gear") you need to get out before the timer runs out. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I hope you have memorized the exact layout of the base - and, you know, the shortest path to get out. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise, you'll blow up and it's Game Over. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You know, I really wanted to like "Zillion". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I wanted it to be the game that put the Master System in the same class as the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'd played this game a little bit in the past. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But when I came back to it for this episode, I actually tried to get all the way through the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Well, actually I did get all the way through the game.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But it is incredibly grueling! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Zillion" is so repetitive I was just cursing it by the time this, uh, game was finished. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The fact that it's just a variation on one room, repeated over and over... it's, sort of, like a Puzzle Game without the puzzles. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the passwords are randomly generated when you enter a room. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, don't think that you're going to write them down in order make the game easier next time you play. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, as most of us know, Sega will release that one special game that stands up to the best FamiCom titles. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But "Zillion" is not that game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once again, I find myself somewhat disappointed. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Pro Yakyuu Pennant Race 🇯🇵 // Great Baseball 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 09 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh man, another one. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But this is at least a little different (and maybe a little better) than the other 'Great Sports' titles. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 First of all, note, this is a U.S. release, rather than just a localization of a Japanese title. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you choose one of your nameless teams in the, uh, nondescript A or N leagues. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Then choose your starting pitcher and actually fool around with its stats a bit. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's a nice little touch. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Curiously, all of this bears a [pretty] heavy resemblance to Jaleco's "Bases Loaded", which was released in Japan at right about the same time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... You still have the same, sort of, behind the pitching mound view (though the pitching mound is a lot smaller in this game). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As with other Baseball Games of this era, you control the pitch using the D-Pad. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like the Jaleco game and the, uh, other Sega 'Great Sports' titles, there is a little bit of speech in these things. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not too common at this time, I suppose, but I guess the most prominent example for the mastery system is, uh, "Get ready!". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But Sports Games seem to require an umpire or announcer yelling occasionally, so it's quite common in these things. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One difference between this and, uh, 'Family Stadium' or "Bases Loaded" is that the fielding is all automatic. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That is, your players run after the ball without your input. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though you do control, uh, what base they throw the ball to, using, you know, the standard, uh, D-Pad configuration of the second base and so on. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 On the negative side, you will be pulling your hair out because your fielders are so damn slow! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sure, they, uh, can't be faster than the runners, but still, they seem really really sluggish. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Batting works about the same as any other Baseball Game around, uh, like on the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Just like "Bases Loaded" the [vantage] point isn't the best for batting, but at least the ball trajectory looks better. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You don't have all those pitches that look way too low. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Those of you with the good memories will say, 'Hey, wait a second! Wasn't there already a "Great Baseball" back in 1985?'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yep! That was the second 'Great Sports' title and a Japan-[only] release - but I guess not considered good enough for U.S. release. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Which is why, when the fancy new version of "Great Baseball" was released in Japan, it was called "The Pro Yakyuu Pennant Race". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It} came out a couple months after the U.S. version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But some changes have been made. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, there was a few more options here in the main menus. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And also, one major change we'll see in a sec. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The C League and the P League. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure if these are, uh, real players or not, but I somewhat doubt it. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, note the, um, fake logos for Coca Cola and Mazuno (otherwise known as Cola Cola and Mazune) it's rather clever. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, check this out: When you hit a ball there's this crazy moving overhead camera view that kicks in. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure why this was changed, but it certainly gives the game a whole different feel than the original U.S. version. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It also seems like there's a whole lot of hits down that first baseline in the Japanese version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also the, uh, referee calls are a bit more expressively voiced. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, I think, uh, "Great Baseball"'s actually [pretty] good! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It's} certainly the best of this episode's Sports titles and, uh, probably a bit better put together than "Bases Loaded". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Oh, and of course, the Japanese version must feature girls in short skirts in the between-inning stretches.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, when it comes to 'Great Sports' titles, we are finally in the homestretch now. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shooting Gallery 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Next up, we have a couple of U.S. Light Gun releases to cover. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, these were actually eventually released in Europe and Brazil, as well - just not in Japan. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I don't have the exact release date of these things, so we'll just go ahead and throw them in randomly. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 First up is "Shooting Gallery". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it's just that - you shoot at things (like ducks). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Rather impressive explosions, there! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just like other Light Gun Games, there's really no theme or anything, just, sort of, uh, random stuff. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are [pretty] nice bright graphics and good animations. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I like the fact that on the title screen, it clearly shows you just shooting at some painted backdrop, leaning against a wall in the basement. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess the moving objects we see aren't really there but rather just hallucinations caused by you overindulging in wood alcohol and prescription cough syrup. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess that makes "Shooting Gallery" just a little disturbing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's the [only] Light Gun Game where you shoot at your DTs. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gangster Town 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Granted "Shooting Gallery" was not that thrilling. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But this next one (also a Light Gun Game designed for the U.S. market) is much cooler! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Gangster Town" puts you in the shoes of some Eliot Ness wannabe, who brings some old-school style law enforcement to the seedier parts of town. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You start off with a little target practice to earn some points. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, if you get enough points, you Level Up. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's right; "Gangster Town" is sorta like a Light Gun R.P.G. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, maybe that's pushing it just a little. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But if you do Level Up, you will get more, uh, hearts in your Life Bar. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The first segment features car chases sequence. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, you try to shoot the gangsters as they lean out of the car, while avoiding getting shot yourself. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is a [pretty] Action-packed sequence. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Eventually a biplane that drops bombs at you, sort of, gets in on the action as well. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Truthfully, it's, sort of, tough to meet both the hit requirements and the hit ratio requirements. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have to kill a lot of people and not miss much. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 After this, the game moves on into a, uh, more standard "Hogan's Alley"-style, uh, sequence. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This was back in the pre-Miranda Rights days, so you can just shoot suspicious looking people on sight. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 No don't need to ask them to drop their weapons, or put their hands up, or anything like that [at] first. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 ({Be} careful not to kill the girl.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 By the way, after shooting someone, you c... -- they gain angel wings and fly away. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You can actually shoot them again and somehow kill their soul. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not [only] do you kill them in this world, but you deny them eternal life in the next world! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You are one hard-hearted bastard! That's for sure! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And that's, uh, (metaphysically speaking) [pretty] terrifying concept! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 At the end of each level there's a boss (that requires multiple hits) as well as a bonus level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In this one, for example, you got to locate the key. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} not sure if this has anything with gangsters, but here it is. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I was finally able to Level Up after this bit. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For an 8-bit Light Gun Game "Gangster Town"'s [pretty] good and quite challenging! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There can be a lot of enemies firing at you at once. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm gonna go on record and say this is definitely the best Light Gun Game for the Master System so far. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's too bad that Japan never got this game, but Sega didn't really seem that interested in promoting the Light Gun in Japan. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here we have the obligatory bar sequence. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Those are some short gangsters! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Missile Defense 3-D 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 We've got another quick U.S.-and-Europe-[only] release here, "Missile Defense 3-D", which was released apparently sometime in 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, yeah, just like Nintendo, Sega came out with a series of 3D games for the Master System. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But the 3D Glasses that Sega used were actually quite clever! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They used an electronic shutter system to very quickly open and close the lenses in sync with the two alternating images on the screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This system was actually quite sophisticated for the time! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... But this means that games like "Missile Defense..." can't really be appreciated without a working set of the 3D Glasses. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Missile Defense..." is, sort of, a 3D update for the Atari's "Missile Command" (that uses the Light Gun). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You shoot down missiles aimed at your cities. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you let a missile sneak past, the city will perish in a nuclear holocaust. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Missile Command", you [only] have one city, so you need to shoot down all the missiles, but you do have more than one chance. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can knock out a good chunk of them right away, uh, but then try to polish them off as they pass over the pole or go through outer space. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You also get a last-ditch chance to destroy any remaining missiles, right before they reach the city. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, all of this really can't quite be captured in video. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The video here is [only] one half of the flickering image (uh, the other one half has been removed). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But this does [seem] to have caused, uh, problems with the Light Gun aim. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, if you do have a Master System with the 3D Glasses, this is definitely a game to get. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Out Run 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 We mark the halfway point of 1987 with another port of a classic Sega Arcade game from Yu Suzuki. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's "OutRun"! Hurray. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just like the Arcade version, you can choose the radio station (though, there's [only] two choices here). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The original Arcade game (seen here) was somewhat the landmark in Racing Games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, "OutRun" isn't exactly a Racing Game; it's technically a Driving Game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 When it hit the Arcades in 1986, it was about the most impressive-looking game out there, with its convincing 3D effects (thanks to Sega's Super Scaler technology) with a massive amount of detailed sprites whizzing by you. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Hang-On", the road was not flat but had little inclines, making it seem surprisingly lifelike! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You could almost get motion sickness. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Some units even had a car-shaped seat. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously the Master System (despite its graphic superiority over any other console at the time) couldn't quite replicate the Arcade game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, you know, it does a decent job. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, one very notable thing about this game it was the first Master System games to support the new FM sound chip (included in the newer Japanese version of the Master System console), which hadn't actually even been released yet. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This Yamaha-produced chip was also found in Yamaha synthesizers of the time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It was capable of adding some better percussion effects to the soundtracks. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, let's actually compare. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is without the FM chip. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And now with the FM chip. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, that FM chip could really liven up the soundtracks to Master System games - in Japan, at least! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., the console never got the upgrade, so we were shafted again. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I'd say the "OutRun" plays decently - not as well as the Arcade version, obviously, but holds up better than the Master System "Space Harrier". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 At the time, though, uh, you would have been blown away when you pop this cartridge in for the first time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The sprite scaling (or rather what stands in for the sprite scaling) is not nearly as smooth. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the action can get choppy, especially when going over hills. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yet sequences like this, they look, uh, surprisingly good for an 8-bit game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here, of course, we're coming up to those, uh, mysterious [little], uh, arches. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I've always wondered, 'What are these things?'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 While much of "OutRun" seems to be inspired by real-life locations, those things always mystified me. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, your vehicle, while it looks [pretty] good, does lack that, uh, distinctive Ferrari logo. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Other areas don't hold up so well. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The desert scenes look [pretty] bland and suffer from an unappealing color scheme that's, sort of, rose and green. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, compared to the disappointing port of "Enduro Racer", "OutRun" is nicely done! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It has become obsolete, due to more accurate versions released for later systems, but... at the time it pulled it off well! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's the [only] FM sound chip supported game this episode, but we'll see a lot more of them next time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, we'll cover the actual rerelease of the Master System in Japan, as well. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 World Soccer 🇯🇵 // Great Soccer 🇺🇸 // Sports Pad Soccer 🇬🇧 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Hey, cool!', you think, 'A Sports title that's not in the 'Great Sports' series? Maybe it'll be a little bit better!'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hmm... 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'But then again', you think, 'Boy! These screens look, sort of, familiar!'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I know I've seen this before! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 No surprise then, in the U.S., this was released as 'Great Soccer'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Why was it called "World Soccer" in Japan? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, let's go all the way back to "Chronsega Episode 1" to this game - the original "Great Soccer". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is actually the third game released for the Master System! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not much has really been changed. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... I guess a better looking character, {the} field now runs sideways (instead of top to bottom), and catchier music, I guess. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But beneath all that it's, more or less, the same game and not really that much different than Nintendo's "Soccer". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I suppose it says something about Sega's lack of inspiration. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Only] 40 games have been released for the Mark III in Japan and they're already remaking some titles! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As I've said before, I don't really like these sorts of team games where the player you're controlling switches around automatically. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Too many situations arise where there are multiple players around the ball, and the control keeps bouncing around. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, if you can tolerate that mechanic unlike Soccer, then, uh, maybe you'll get a kick out of this game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Anmitsu Hime 🇯🇵 // Alex Kidd in High Tech World 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's odd how many licensed properties were made in this episode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's another one, "Anmitsu Hime"! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Much like "[Sukeban] Deka II" and "High School! Kimengumi", it's a hybrid Adventure / Action Game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The difference is, this one was released in the U.S., eventually. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Anmitsu Hime' was an old manga from Kurakane Shosuke. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It originally ran in the early 1950s. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Quite popular. It was adapted into various TV shows over the years, including the animated series that inspired this game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Known in the West as 'Sugar Princess', it concerns a precocious Japanese Princess and her wacky adventures. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Set in medieval Japan, it features various anachronistic elements, like modern day appliances. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In this game, your goal is to find eight pieces of a map so you can locate a new bakery [that just] opened in town. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This involve running around the castle, entering the many rooms, and talking to the inhabitants. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The first piece is [pretty] easy. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You just talk to your father and he'll give it to ya. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though, of course he gives you the wrong piece of paper and you need to go back to him and talk to him again. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have a map screen, which will show you a very rough layout of the castle, as well as which pieces you have. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It seems that finding most of the pieces involves talking to someone, then running - doing something, talking to someone else, or finding some object, then coming back. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, Master System devotees might recognize this game, as it was released in the U.S. two years later, under the name "Alex Kidd in High Tech World". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The sprites are all changed, but really not by that much. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you can see here, there is still, sort of, the weird medieval Japanese setting. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In a rather shameless bit of self promotion, Alex is looking for a new video Arcade that Sega has opened up. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If that sounds kind of unlikely, I'll point out that in Japan Sega really does have a chain of video game entertainment centers. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, while we might be pleased that Sega localized one of their Adventure Games for the U.S. market, the thing is, this is a really bad game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One seeming inspiration for this was, uh, the U.S. Graphical Adventure Games, like the kind that Sierra used to make (you know, "King's Quest" and so on). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They've taken, uh, a lot of the, uh, most dated and interfering elements of those games (like the arbitrary unexplained deaths) and used them liberally. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 A lot of the puzzles don't really make much sense. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, at least this one makes a little bit... it's simply a very simple, uh, test that you have to take. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Most of the answers aren't that hard. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, some people will find -- might find that math problem a little tricky, I suppose. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But you can, of course, eventually just guess the answer. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's what I mean by sudden deaths. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Touch the paper. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ooh! And it's Game Over. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 That kind of stuff seems to be happening all the time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Touch the wrong object - like, say, put on the armor for example. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, it's Game Over. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Turn on the home computer? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Game Over. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And again, the solutions to these puzzles. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, as I mentioned, they don't really make a whole lot of common sense. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, to deal with the burned paper, you have to go around, uh, find a telephone book, find a telephone, and then make a phone call. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, who do you call? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, apparently you call Rockwell! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Rockwell? What's he have anything to do with this game? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And (wouldn't, you know, it?) Rockwell just happens to have a powder that can restore burned paper! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Again, it's all very odd. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Some are even worse. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like these guys, for example, you have to enter and reenter their c... -- empty room countless times until they appear. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... They tell you, they don't have anything, and then later, you have to keep coming back over and over again until finally they do have the piece of paper. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Again, it's not always something you can, sort of, you know, figure out. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Since there's a timer and time is lost every time you have to enter or exit a room. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Can't really do too much experimentation. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You still need to figure out exactly what to do and then hurry up. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now once you have the map, you exit the castle and head to the Arcade, whereupon the game becomes a subpar Platformer. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are three very short stages - all of them virtually identical. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And while they are not, in theory, very long, they stretch the game's length out by causing so many cheap deaths. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, here is perhaps the absolute worst moment in the entire game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Another really horrendous Adventure Game style thing here, and with this town that exists between the two levels. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In order to get a pass to go on to the next level, you need to pray at the altar over and over again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I lost count, but some walkthroughs claim it's 100 times. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, really, this is simply idiotic! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Who at Sega decided that gamers would really find this fun? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are also some really baffling and out of place elements in the second half of the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, you can collect gold coins and use them to buy and sell items. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But I haven't really been able to figure out what exactly to do with gold coins. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the items all seem [pretty] useless! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, one item you don't want to get: the gun. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Pick it up and you'll get arrested at the gate. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, it's Game Over. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the context of an 'Alex Kidd' game, none of this really makes any sense. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like, after all, you are the heir to the throne and this heroic figure. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, why does everyone in the game treat you like some snot-nosed punk. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And again, who knew the Alex lived in historic Japan? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Since this was not designed as an 'Alex Kidd' game, it doesn't really fit at all into the rest of the series. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. release actually came out after "Alex Kidd: Lost Stars". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, the whole thing must have seemed very disappointing to 'Alex Kidd' fans (assuming that there were any) expecting, sort of, like, another Action Game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is certainly the, uh, worst in the entire 'Alex Kidd' series and probably one of the worst games for the Master System so far (at least to make in the U.S.). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, if you're wondering what the -- one of those, uh, Arcade "OutRun" cabinets look like, there it is, right there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's really enough to make you think twice about wishing more wacky Japanese games were released for the U.S. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's not really fair to "Anmitsu Hime" to blame it for not being an 'Alex Kidd' game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But really, even by itself, that game wasn't very good either. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, all in all, [pretty] major disappointment. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 3 Wrap Up ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once again, I find myself somewhat disappointed with the Master System. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Remember that all these titles came out concurrently with such FamiCom releases like "Zelda II...", "Dragon Warrior" II", all those great titles from Konami, and so on. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like I said before, Sega is stretching themselves a little thin in their desperate attempt to get games on the shelves. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They have yet to get any other publishers release games for the Master System. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And they haven't really yet mastered the art of making console games, themselves. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, let me tell you something; change is on the way. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "...Episode 4" will mark a turning point for Sega; and more good games will come out for the system. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I can promise you that. 🍇🍌
