👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chronsega Episode 6 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 Welcome to the [sixth episode] of 'Chronsega', the uglier, [slightly] deformed, younger sibling of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Today], we [start] off [in] June [1988] and end up [in] October [of] the same year. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We [also have] a few Western releases [that] I think came [out] {in} the [second] half [of] the year... possibly. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Big changes [for] the Master System [in] summer [1988]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Suddenly], third-[party] developers appear - [not] original games, [but ports of] Arcade games from Taito, Irem, [and] Data East. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Prior [to] this episode, the [only] big third-party name we've seen [has] been Tecmo. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega, themselves, even [contribute] some [decent] Action [Platformers]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 All [in] all, [this is], I'd say, the [strongest lineup] of games [we've] seen [yet for] the Master System. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Lord of Sword 🇯🇵 // Lord of the Sword 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 June 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alright], we [start this episode] off [exactly] where we left off [in] "Chronsega Episode 5" - on June 2nd, [1988]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this is "Lord of Sword", a rather awkward name. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, for the U.S. release, [they altered it slightly] to "Lord of the Sword". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, here's the weird thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Remember] "[Kenseiden]", the [last] game [from] "Chronsega ... 5", [released the exact] same day [as] this? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya played a slow, clumsy swordsman who was [constantly getting] pelted by much [faster], more agile enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [your] character in "Lord of Sword" [is virtually] the same guy, [just sorta] given a Sword and Sorcery makeover. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In [fact], ["Kenseiden" and] "Lord of Sword" are very [similar] games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And it's] really [quite] strange [that] Sega [would release] two games [that are] so much alike on the same day. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes, uh, "Lord [of] Sword" does give you a [pretty] much worthless map. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] doesn't tell ya where you are! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 How {are} [you] supposed [to] use a map like that? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Landau ([and] yeah, that's the guy's name, Landau) has some basic sword attacks, [just] like [Hayato] from "[Kenseiden]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The crouching sword attack, [in particular], look almost [identical in] both games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Naturally], enemies keep popping up [and] jumping at you (or often jumping over you) [and] then coming [at] ya from [behind]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The fact that] so many of 'em [take] multiple hits mean you [will almost certainly] take some damage [in any given] level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, one handy thing ya do have is a bow [and] arrow. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [can] take [out enemies from] a distance. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, [it actually] takes a moment to pull [it out] {and} draw back the arrow. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So it's really [only] good for stationary or very slow-moving [enemies]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Faster [enemies would] be on top of you [before ya had] a chance [to] fire off an arrow. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [get] hints from N.P.C.s (such as [this] tree or villagers) though [the hints aren't] really [that] helpful. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like... Where is Namo, [for] example? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The map [isn't] labeled. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, these guys [will have] a few [different] lines of dialogue. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But you] need to [exit and] re-enter the screen [in order for 'em to] speak a second time, in [order to] hear [everything] they have to say. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so [I'll] run off some [of] the [peculiar] things [about] "Lord of Sword". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As mentioned, it's hard to avoid damage, so ya will die. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But you [can] continue [when] this happens. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [In fact, this only] puts ya back {at the} beginning [of the] level [that you] died on, [with] all [your items] intact. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game is built, uh, as a bunch of, [like], really [short] levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So there's] no serious consequences [of] dying, [as] far [as] I know. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, [certain] levels [will] offer connections [to different] levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, [for] example, where ya see [that] hill [in the] background, walking along the ground off the screen [will] take ya [to] one level, [but] climbing up the hill [will] send you on another path entirely. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The structure reminds me a [bit] of the Nintendo "Rambo" game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have a series of horizontally [linked] screens, with occasional intersections [that allow] ya across over to a new area. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Each] village simply [consists of a] few [houses and] maybe one N.P.C. [that] you [can], uh, talk to. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You refill [your] Life Bar by re-entering a house [multiple] times. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are a] few [items to] collect, seen on the top [right of] the screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [it] has [sort] of a very simplified "Zelda II..." or "Castlevania II" feel to it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As mentioned, Landau [controls] very sluggishly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] since each [of] the Master System's two [buttons are] used [to] fire a weapon, ya hafta jump by pressing Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this guy makes Simon [Belmont look sprightly], by comparison. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] a boss-like character; you [can] obtain an [item] from him. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] a leaf. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} [not] sure [what it] does; {the} game [doesn't really] tell ya. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Lord of Sword" is [an interesting]-looking scrolling Hack-'n'-Slash-type game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I wish [it] was a [little bit better]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I liked [it] less [than "Kenseiden"], even. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If [your] character [controlled better and] the game gave you a [bit] more [information about] the game world, quests, [and] the [items] (ya [know, that sorta] thing) [it would probably] be a [bit] more fun. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Racing 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Hey, "Super Racing"! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 No, [not "Great] Racing"; Sega's [already] dropped the '[Great]...' label on their games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Cool music, though! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] there's two [different] modes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [We'll] get to [that in] just a sec. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah, look [at] the, uh, car names. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Isn't that] cute? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, eventually, you'll go through all the menus [and whatnot and start] the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Each track has two parts: a practice run (where [your] time determines [your] place [in] the lineup) [and] then the real race. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm not] really sure [what] the difference [between] the two are. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, as ya [can] see, this is [another] one [of those] Japanese [top]-down Racing Games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We had a couple of these [on the] FamiCom, like Nintendo's "FamiCom [Grand] Prix". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These things never seem [to] make [it outside of] Japan, [for] some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And I [personally] do find 'em a [little annoying]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They take [some] practice; ya hafta drive a track {a} couple times [before] ya really [sorta get] the feel of it, since ya [can't] really see ahead of you [at] all. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [only] indication [of] a turn are those arrows [that] appear on the ground. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, after the Practice, we have the actual race (three laps, [in] this case). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] see, you [can] collide with the other cars. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess ya take some [sort] of damage, since there's a [status] screen and you [can] do a pit stop [to] repair. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] I [didn't] really [notice any] decrease [in] my car's [performance] after [those] few collisions. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, [let's] go back [to] those two modes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The B.G.M. Mode is the one where there's [BackGround Music] playing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [With] the other mode ([which] is called the 'Real Mode') there's no [music - just] sound effects. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The controls [are pretty] simple. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One [button] accelerates; the other changes gears (ya [just] have two gears). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] a [decent little] game - [certainly] more pleasing [to] the eye than any [of the similar] games on the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] also, I guess, more pleasing-looking than the Master System "[OutRun]", which looked [kinda] flickery [and whatnot]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [it's not exactly] state-[of]-the-art, [but] really [not that] bad either! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Captain Silver 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's [the] first in a series [of] several [ports] of non-Sega games, "Captain Silver". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} [not exactly] a top-tier Arcade [title], but [for] the Master System, ya take [what] you [can] get. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Captain Silver" is a [pirate]-themed game (as you [could probably] guess) [but your] character is [not] Captain Silver. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Nope! He's the bad guy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [are] rather the Guybrush Threepwood-style adventurer who's out [to find] the legendary treasure of [Captain] Silver. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The original [Data] East Arcade game [came out in '87 (around] the same time [as] "Karnov"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like "Karnov", [it's] a rather difficult "[Ghosts] 'n' Goblins"-style game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} really [isn't that] memorable. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 For the Master System release, the colors were [muted quite] a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade game had some [pretty] ugly colors! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [hit detection] was improved [and] the entire thing made a [bit] more enjoyable. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} 1st [Level] takes place in a [quaint little] fairy tale town [with] werewolves, witches, [and] pumpkins everywhere. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] various things [to] pick up, [such as] the [boots] {that} make ya jump higher. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, fairies [will] appear. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When they do, make sure ya grab 'em, [as] this [will] power [up] your sword [to] fire projectiles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this is [the] key [to beating] the game - having the powered-up sword. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It'll] make [certain] parts go much smoother. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Some rather [hateful platforming] is tossed in here [and] there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yep! Landing in [the] fountain will kill you! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Who knows why?) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [collect] Gold [as] ya go along, [and] when ya [find] a Shop, you [can] buy power-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The thing [that] looks [like] a jar [of] brown liquid gives [ya] the [ability] {to} take one hit [without] dying. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} [first] boss [is] a rather scary-looking witch. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [With] the [powered]-up sword, [however], this goes by [pretty] quickly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And ya do also [get] a [great] death animation on [the] witch. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Captain Silver" is [not] a terribly long game - six levels [with] a boss [at] the end of each. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [second] level [is] a [pirate] ship [with] a [pirate] boss. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But here's the thing: This is the version [that] was [released in] Japan [and] Europe. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For the U.S. release, the game was [literally cut] in half. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] U.S. [cart] is 1 Meg versus 2. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Two entire levels [were removed], almost all the bosses, {and} several types of enemies were [cut] out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. "Captain Silver" is much [shorter and] much easier! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 After finishing [the original version of the] game ([you know], this one here) I tried playing the U.S. version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you [can] sleepwalk [through] the thing in, like, 10 [to] 15 minutes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most of the projectile-throwing enemies [are] gone, [so you can sorta] slash [your] way [through] the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's one boss missing from the U.S. game! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's [difficult] because [it] takes [just] so many darn hits [to] kill [him]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's easy to jump over his] fireballs, [but] because this [just] goes on [and] on, there's [a chance of] you slipping up as [your] attention wanes. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's another level that was much easier in the U.S. version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Watch [out for the] coconuts!) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [hit detection], I think, is [somewhat questionable at] times - [but it's] usually in [your] favor. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's certainly much improved [over the] Arcade game, [which] is [quite] unfair [at] times. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But remember], most of "Captain Silver"'s difficulty comes [from the fact] there's no Life Bar, [meaning] ya have one-[hit] deaths. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This makes a few bosses [quite difficult]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Speaking of which, we have [that] one boss, the Banana Guy - the guy who makes ya wanna throw [your] controller on the ground [and] jump on it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [To] damage this guy, ya hafta touch [him directly with your] sword. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [projectiles won't hurt him]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Only his feet and] head [are unprotected]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So ya need to get right] up [in front] of [him] while he's slowly advancing [and hitting at] you [with] a flail. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He'll raise [his] arm when [he] does a high flail attack, [but] the low attacks [are] much more k... -- unexpected. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And he'll corner you [at] the edge [of] the screen [and] ya [can't] jump over [him]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If ya [had] a Life Bar, he would [just] be [pretty] easy, but the [fact that] one mistake kills you makes [him really, like], an exercise [in] frustration. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [wouldn't] call [it] a game-breaker, [but] you'll like "Captain Silver" a [lot] less because [of] this one guy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, after [some platforming (which] is thankfully rare [in] this game) you encounter Captain Silver, himself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's a bit tricky because he throws very [fast projectiles at] ya. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And if ya [don't] plan accordingly, [you can get trapped] by him [at] the edge [of] the screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You need to] jump over the fireballs [and] land close [enough to] run underneath him... [the] next time [he] jumps. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Finally, we [get] the actual treasure of [Captain Silver] - some [enormous] rings [and], uh, Gold coins. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then ya [get an illustrated] epilogue (once again, missing from the U.S. release). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I'd say "Captain Silver" falls [into] the '[surprisingly] enjoyable' [category]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's much [better than the Master System] "Rygar" [and] I found [it] more fun [than] "Lord [of] Sword". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [While it can't] compare [to] some [of] the [better] N.E.S. games (like "Contra" {or} "Bionic Commando") [in] terms of slickness, on the Master System this is one [of] the [better] games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} [certainly] an [improvement] over the Arcade game and, uh, [better than the] FamiCom [port], which [we'll encounter] a few [episodes from] now. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Final Bubble Bobble 🇯🇵 // Bubble Bobble 🇬🇧 // Dragon Maze 🇧🇷 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is [surprising]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 All [of] a sudden, Sega's [getting] ports of non-Sega Arcade games! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is "Final Bubble Bobble" - {the} first Taito-[developed] game on the Master System (though Sega actually published [it]). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Despite] the weird name, [it's just] a [regular port] of good [old] "Bubble [Bobble]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} even [has] a [little] Arcade-[style] demo mode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This was also] released in Eu..., uh -- Europe under the name "Bubble Bobble" [and in Brazil as] "Dragon Maze" ([not] released [in the] U.S.). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As we know, this [originally hit] Arcades [in 1986 - sort] of a [deliberately] old-school-[style] video game, [at] a time when Arcade games [were getting] more [and] more elaborate. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 An N.E.S. [port] came [out in] Japan [for 1987, so let's] do [sort of] a comparison here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [When] we fire up the N.E.S. version, one thing [we'll notice] is [that] the intro [is] missing the [background] stars. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Colors [are a little] off, [for] one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [enemies] look a [little weird when they get] trapped [in] the bubbles. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], by comparison, the Master System version has [brighter] colors [and] more detail in [its] sprites. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's not quite] pixel-perfect, [but it's definitely] more [accurate than] the Nintendo version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And it just somehow] feels a [bit] more like the Arcade game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm not] really sure why this never came [out in] the U.S.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I assume [it] was due [to] Nintendo [of] America's [restrictions] regarding games [appearing] on [competing platforms]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [unfortunately] for Japanese [Master System] owners, this was the [only Taito] game released for the console in [that] territory. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It might seem a bit] odd, as the Master System release schedule [in] Japan seems [pretty] robust [at] this point. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Five games came [out in] July [1988]. 🍇 

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But], in reality, the system [was getting ready to] wind up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} Japanese [Master System was getting ready to have] one [last] blaze of glory [in] fall [1988]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Whereas in] the West, [I] mean, [it was actually starting to] pick up a bit. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We actually have another [Taito] game coming up soon, uh, [that] was [only] released in the [West] (never came [out in] Japan). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, as [for] "Final Bubble Bobble", it's, uh, [definitely] the [better of] the two home versions we've seen so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Megumi Rescue 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Aicom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Next [up], we have a [bit] of a change [of] pace with "Megumi Rescue". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([That] means "Fire Brigade Rescue".) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Note] the credit to Aicom and [the] 'Reprogrammed Game [Copyrighted to] Sega' credit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Generally, this appears on games [that] were [ported from another] system, implying [that this] originally appeared on a [different platform]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It certainly] feels like an old-school Arcade game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] if this was originally an Arcade [title], I've never heard of it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It does bear a [lot] of [similarity] to a Western [Computer] game called "Rescue Squad", which was [from] Muse (the same guys who [did] the first 'Castlevania' game). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But there's no real connection [between that] game [and] this one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's probably just a coincidence or a case [of] inspiration. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, "Megumi Rescue" is another game in the old "Breakout"/"Kaboom!" tradition. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] uses the, uh, Master System [rotary] paddle controller [to] move the [firefighters] on the ground. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [will] bounce up [one of your firefighters in] the air. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [object] is [to] grab onto a window. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If the window is occupied by a person, then you p... -- grab ahold [of] them, [and jump] down, [and] rescue 'em. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, [of] course, you need to, uh, catch the people when they land. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, you'll find [objects other than] people [in] the windows, such as the helicopter, which seems to [automatically complete] the level for you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It even gives you] access to a [silly little Bonus] Round [where ya] try [to] catch falling [objects]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 After this, ya move on to another building. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [believe] there [are 30] buildings [in] all, [and] each are unique in terms of [design and] layout. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [There's] all [kinds of] things [to] find [in] the buildings [that'll] give ya [extra points]: money, {and} safes full of valuables. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [There's] a Gold Key [which unleashes] a [torrent] of [water onto] the building, thus ([apparently]) saving everyone. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 According to a review I [read of] this game, there's [an] object which will quote-unquote "nuke" the building, thus [ending the] level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure [if] this [refers to] the helicopter [or] something else. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [What] looks like a bomb is [shot into] the building [at] the end of each level ([for] example, [when] the helicopter finishes a level for you). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] not sure if that's what the [reviewer was] referring to [or if] there actually is some [kind] of [nuclear] device which I [haven't] found. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You're [also up] against a time [limit], as the fire spreads [and] people [start] jumping. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You, yourself, [can] catch on fire [and] die, [of] course. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Also, landing on the hard [concrete will] kill ya. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's a [pretty] fun game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Despite] its [simplicity], it's actually a [pretty neat] idea for a "Kaboom!" clone. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Thunder Blade 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the [last] game [in] July is another Arcade port, "Thunder Blade". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This does [not have] a [very good reputation] nowadays - [and for] good reason, as [we'll] see. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We've seen a [handful of Shoot]-'em-Ups [on] the Master System, [but] nothing too terribly [exciting]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Thunder Blade" [isn't] gonna change [that], because [it's] actually [pretty] subpar. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 See, here's the thing: the [Arcade] game was the [latest] in Sega's series of 3D Super Scaler games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [They] were [often found in] those super awesome deluxe cabinets. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But even when ya played on a regular cabinet, "Thunder Blade" was really cool because [it] had this very impressive [sprite]-based 3D effect. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It [used stacked sprites to] make passing buildings look [like] they were actually in 3D. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It alternated between] these [sort] of, uh, [top]-down [and first]-person viewpoints. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya had enemies flying towards you, missiles [shooting] everywhere, huge explosions. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like so many other of Sega's, uh, Arcade games, [it] was technically very impressive. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the [Master System] version? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, no, not so much. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, all the [stacked] sprites [and] 3D [effects have] been [pretty] much removed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] helicopter [can] no longer change its altitude. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have two weapons: a machine gun [and] missiles (uh, which [are used to] take [out surface] enemies) [and] both are [incredibly] boring-looking! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So [it] boils down [to] being, like, [a repetitive and] dull [Shoot]-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} [first]-person sections look maybe a [little] nicer, but, uh, still, uh, some rather crude [attempts] were made in -- in tryin' [to replicate] the look of the Arcade [game]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Still, the [first]-person levels are [pretty] boring! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most [aircraft just] line up [to] be [shot] then fly away harmlessly. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alternately], when [you're dealing with] the tanks, they shoot these [projectiles that] fly [around], like, weird [curved paths and are] very hard [to] dodge. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] hafta move all [over] tryin' [to] survive. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's this, uh, rather, uh, boring boss [battle] where ya fly over [an] aircraft [to] then [shoot it] down. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or maybe it's a -- a [missile] or something; [I'm] really [not] sure. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Thunder Blade" is stuck in a no-man's land. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega [couldn't replicate] the Arcade game's visual [excitement, and] they chose not [to] add [anything that might make the] [console] version fun ([like] interesting enemies [or] power-ups). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's both boring [and frustrating at] the same time! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] a rather -- another failed attempt by Sega [to] bring one [of their Arcade] games [into] the home. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Rastan 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 [?] [?] 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alright], let's switch gears [for] a [second] here [and] examine a few more non-Japanese releases (games [that] were [released only in] the Americas or Europe). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [We'll start with] "Rastan", which I think [was released in] the U.S. [in the second] half of [1988]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Rastan" is a classic Sword and Sorcery-[type] game, much like "Lord [of] Sword", [only] more fun. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, look! I [got] a piece of armor [here]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [They're], uh, randomly dropped; they add [to your] defense. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The object [is pretty] simple: Swing your sword, walk [forward, and] kill [everything that] moves. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Rastan", like "Bubble Bobble", was a [Taito] Arcade game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Its] protagonist was clearly based [on] "Conan the Barbarian", [and] the game was [naturally pretty] violent. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Enemies [would explode] in [fountains of] gore [when] killed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike Arthur [from] "Ghosts 'n' Goblins", Rastan was a rugged dude [with] a Life Bar [represented] by a [realistic]-looking human heart. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} a fun game and one [that] made [its] way [to the] Master [System with] all the blood intact. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] the game has been changed [quite] a bit (much less [fast]-paced with fewer enemies). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In [other] words, it's gone from being a [quarter]-gobbler to a more console-[friendly] game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] seven levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Each starts [outdoors, and then you] move on to a castle of some sort, then a boss [battle]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the [first] boss, [right] here - [some sort of] half-monster/half-horse dude. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 None [of] the [bosses are] too [terribly difficult to] kill. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, in "Rastan", you'll [encounter a constant] stream of enemies, [but] those [aren't] really [your biggest] problem. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 No, [that] would be the environment. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Rastan [is] very [vulnerable to] bodies of [water, and his] jump is a [bit] difficult [to] control. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And that] means you'll land [in the water] a lot. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Furthermore, [inside] the castle, [there's quite] a few lava pits, [and] moving spikes, [and that sorta] thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some jumping challenges seem more [suited for] Mega Man than [for] the big bulky Rastan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 His high jump (which is [activated] by pressing the upper diagonals [on] the D-Pad) is a bit tricky [to] pull off, [and] I [found] myself falling on spikes [pretty frequently]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Even worse, ya [can't] control Rastan [in] mid-[jump], making [moments like] this a [little] unfair. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {If} [you] try [to], uh, jump [and] land on [one of] those [platforms], you'll [just] sail [right] over. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [From what] I [can] tell, ya simply [can't] land on 'em when [you're] in the [water]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [To] add insult [to] injury, Rastan freezes [for] a second whenever [he] takes damage. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Fortunately], ya do have a wall bounce move [to] help you [in situations like] this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, [for] me [at] least, [it] always [felt] like I was [sorta] struggling a bit with the controls (something ya never experience in a '...Mario...' or a 'Mega Man' game). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [As] I mentioned, bosses are usually [not that] tough. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] best friend for many [of] these encounters is a downward sword thrust, used in mid-jump. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's actually pretty] similar [to] the attack Link had in "Zelda II...". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As the game progresses, you'll pass through a number of, uh, [different environments (mountains], forests, [fiery] volcanoes...). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The volcano level has the best boss: a huge, red, multi-[sprite] dragon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya need to kill this guy by [hitting him] on the head ({a} common theme [for] most of "Rastan"'s bosses). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, things [get] a [little] sadistic in [the] last level, [which is, like], a "Labyrinth"-style castle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then ya finally get [to] the last boss, which is a smaller Red Dragon. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It was actually] a [bit] disappointing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They should've [placed this] guy [on] the [second-to]-last dungeon [and] then used the big dragon as a final boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] oh well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, after taking care [of the last] boss, you [get] a lil epilogue [that sorta] tells you [that] Rastan was [rescuing] a Princess. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Well, that's original!) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] actually a [completely different] story [than] the Arcade game, by the way. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, in an unusual touch, Rastan (I guess, suffering from some sorta low self-esteem) slinks away [from] the Princess who loves him, since he [doesn't] deserve [her]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, [and] take a look! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The name [of] the kingdom is Chamois (or maybe that's Cham-ois). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I'd call "Rastan" a [pretty] successful Arcade conversion. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Certainly] it's superior [to] most of Sega's similar efforts (or "Rygar" [for] Master System). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Rastan's clumsy jumping [results in most of] the frustration, but there aren't any really terrible [situations] ya [can't] live with, so [it's definitely] worth [your] time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shanghai 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 [?] [?] 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Brody Lockhart | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's our third U.S. [and] Europe-[only] game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's "Shanghai", a game [we've] seen [before]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, I think this is the [only] version [to have an] animated [title] screen, [and] ya finally get to find out which {of} those two guys wins the game! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] seems Sega was [responsible for] this [ported] version, the umpteenth port of this old [Computer] classic. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's also got] in-game instructions. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Very nice! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this is one mellow jam! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I could [totally] listen [to] this music on a rainy day. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [So], yeah, this is the, uh, third time we've seen "Shanghai". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It already] turned up [in] "Chrontendo [Episode 29" and] "Chronturbo Episode 1". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was a launch game [for] the P.C. Engine in Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Which means that, yes, "Shanghai" is the [first] game [to] be released on all three [platforms] - Master System, FamiCom, [and] P.C. Engine. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Not] many games [get that] honor. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Another one [that] springs [to] mind is Falcom's "Ys". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, we all know how [to] play this game, right? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You] select a matching pair of tiles [to] remove them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [object] is to clear all the tiles. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As usual, there's [quite] a few menu options. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Like], is [that] music breaking [your] concentration? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then change [it]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] even turn [it] off [completely]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] also reverse moves, use various cheats (or hints, [if] you wanna call 'em that). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, I [got] stuck [with] no more [possible] moves. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, is this [as] good [as] the P.C. Engine version? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, maybe. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The P.C. Engine "Shanghai" has easier-[to]-read tiles, so I guess the prize goes [to] Hudson. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Vigilante 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 [?] [?] 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by IREM | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's our [next] Western-[only] release, "Vigilante". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, once again, [it's taken] from a non-Sega Arcade game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The cute little] intro [sort] of vaguely describes {the} situation. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Gangs [have] taken over the town. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then, [unfortunately], Sega screws up [and] changes the wording on this [part, right] here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 '...rogues have taken Maria.' 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Let's take] a look [at] the [Arcade] "Vigilante" from Irem, [which] came [out in 1987, despite] the ['88] copyright. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 'The skinheads [have] taken Madonna hostage.' 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [that] is a [Beat]-'em-Up plot, [right] there; you [take] the law [into your] own hands. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If the cops [get involved], they'll [just send] the [criminals through] the namby-pamby legal system. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [better to just] kill everybody [with your] own bare hands (or, even [better, with] nunchucks). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Vigilante" was a pre-"Double Dragon"-[style Beat]-'em-Up - [sort of] a [follow-up to] Irem's "Kung Fu". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's not] a [great] game, but [serviceable]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The Master [System] version has one major problem - these guys (yeah, the guys [with] green pants [and] white shirts). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They'll run up [and] choke you, draining your health until ya shake 'em off. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] the Arcade game, you could [hit] 'em [just like] any other [enemy]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, they [pretty] much ignore [your] punches [and] kicks [about 75% of] the time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [only] way [to] guarantee you [will knock] these guys down [before] they reach you is with these nunchucks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When ya pick up the nunchucks, [for] God's sake, [don't] lose 'em. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The signage [and] billboards [in the] background are [quite] strange. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Several of 'em say Maria's name. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Is she a [popular attraction] in town? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Is she [your] girlfriend? [Little] sister? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Based on the way she's dressed [in] the cutscene, she looks [to] be about 10 years old. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We have the first boss coming up here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once again, he's [one of] those guys ya [just sorta] duck down [and] punch [in the] nuts over [and] over again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, okay, [well], "Vigilante" is [actually] really simple (even by [1987 Beat]-'em-Up standards). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [don't] have any fancy [moves], really; most enemies [are] taken [out] easily [with a] couple punches. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's just] those damn chokehold guys! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If ya [don't] have the nunchucks, try [to] jump [over them and they'll just] pass [right] by you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [don't] know why Sega made 'em so hard [to] hit! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most [of the] time, [your] blow seems [to] connect visually, but they [just] pass [right] through it [and] grab you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's actually quite irritating]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a [bit] of a shame because, otherwise, "Vigilante" would be a [reasonable], fun, [mindless little] game ([definitely better than] Sega's own "My Hero"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] as [it] is, [this] is a game [that's really] most likely [just to] piss you off. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Rambo III 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 [?] [?] 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Speaking of things we've seen [before], it's [another] 'Rambo' game, making this the third 'Rambo' game we've come across [in] the 'Chron...' series. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] guess what? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's gonna be more [in] the future. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Rambo III" is named after the movie, released in May of [1988]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, ya [might recall there] was a similar "Rambo III" Arcade game [from Taito that] was released around the same time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These two games [are] unconnected, [despite] having, [sort] of, very, uh, [similar] gameplay. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The Master System "Rambo [III]" was clearly inspired by "Operation Wolf". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The manual claims the game [depicts] Rambo [rescuing Trautman from] a [Soviet] base in Afghanistan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] I mean, [come] on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Do any of the guys [in] this game look like [Soviet] Army [to] you? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} sure looks [to] me [like] this was designed [as] some [sorta] generic [Light] Gun [Shooter, and] the 'Rambo' license was [added at] the last moment. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Supposedly], the game is very short. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [dunno, 'cause] I [can only] last [a] few minutes, myself. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike a [lotta] these sorts [of] games, [multiple enemies appear at] the same time [and start shooting at] you, meaning there's [pretty] much no way you [can] take 'em all [out at] once, [and you're gonna] be slowly taking damage. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'd say [that memorization] is [probably] the key [to getting] very far [in] "Rambo III". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We have seen some [decent] games today. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] "Rambo III" goes [definitely] to the [bottom of] the pile. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Maou Golvellius 🇯🇵 // Golvellius: Valley of Doom 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 14 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Compile 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alright], we're back to the Japanese release schedule and [August 1988], with "Golvellius: Valley of Doom" (perhaps the big game this episode). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] tell it's gonna be good by the awesome music... and the name Compile in the credits. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The game starts off with a nice [illustrated] cutscene. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It involves] a sick King, uh, a missing Princess, [and] a wandering green-haired hero... who wears a miniskirt. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh no, nevermind, that's a -- a tunic. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [does this] seem [sort] of "...Zelda"-inspired [to] you? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, well, "[Golvellius]..." is [definitely] a "...Zelda" clone. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Oddly, this lady] says he's empty-handed [and] gives [him a] sword, [but] he clearly had a sword in the opening cutscene. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hmm... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 What's going on here, Compile? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the game starts up and... Wow! Look [at] ya go! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Let] me tell ya, if you've played, uh, "Lord [of] Sword", "Rastan", "[Captain] Silver", [and then] this game, it's like a breath of fresh air. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Suddenly], you [can] run quickly [and] jump. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, holy cow! This guy [can] move! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] the first of several side-scrolling sequences. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the first [giant] red snake you'll encounter [that] throw either smaller snakes or fireballs at ya. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Then you emerge [onto] the overworld. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [At this] point, uh, "[Golvellius]..."' debt [to "...Zelda"] becomes very clear. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have a grid of [interconnected] screens. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When you enter a new screen, monsters [start] appearing, which you [can] kill [for] money. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Killing a few [monsters will often cause] a hole [in] the [ground] to appear. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, let's call [it] a cave. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Inside, you'll [meet] someone, like Randar (who was, sort of, Compile's [mascot]; ya [might remember] him in "...Guardian Legend"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] this game, he refills [your] health for [150] Gold. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, fairies! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They give ya hints [and] maybe [spout some] gibberish. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This old lady [will] sell ya stuff ([for] example, life potions to [increase your] maximum health). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They function [sorta] like the tanks in "Metroid". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [By] the time we've [reached] the end [of] the game, [that], uh, health box up [in the] upper [right] corner there [will] be [completely] full. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [before] we go any further, [let's just actually] go back a step. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "[Golvellius]..." was [originally a] Japanese [Computer] game, [released] in [1987] on the M.S.X.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Pac" Fujishima was the game [designer]; he [also] did the original "Guardic" game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game world and, uh, [layout and] graphics were [completely different than] the [Master System] version, [but] it's still basically the same game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Then, [in 1988], Compile re-released it in [an enhanced] version [for] the M.S.X.2. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game had [an introduction], giving a [bit] of backstory. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the game starts [in] the village surrounding the castle, [and] there [are] some N.P.C.s [and] fetch [quests before] ya enter the main [overworld]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The graphics [for] the [monsters are quite] a [bit] different, but some graphics ([like] the [old] ladies) are [identical] to the [Master System] version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 According [to] one Japanese site, this came [out] on [August] 2nd ([about] 12 days [before] the [Master System] version). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I assume [that] Compile worked on both versions [at the] same time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, much like "...Zelda", [your] main objective [is to] find a series [of] dungeons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though in "[Golvellius]...", these [are] either side-scrolling dungeons ([like] we saw earlier) or [vertical] dungeons with [forced]-scrolling (like here). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] the end of each dungeon, you'll [encounter] a boss [battle]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Defeating] each boss does a few things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] refills [your] health [and] money [to the maximum]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [it opens] a door to a cave where an old lady is selling crystals, [and it] unlocks the next area. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In order [to complete] the game, [ya need to] buy all seven crystals (one [for] each boss). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [You] see, uh, "[Golvellius]..." is more linear [than] "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] need to unlock each [of the] seven areas, one [at a] time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [wouldn't] call [them] 'levels', because you [can] move [between] any [of] the [unlocked] areas [at] any time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you [will need to] backtrack in points. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [sort] of vaguely, uh, Metroidvania-like, I guess. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, [and] here's [what I] mean by, uh, fairies [spouting] gibberish. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A [lot of] times, they [actually don't really] give any helpful [hints at] all. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Every screen, or -- [Almost] every screen has a, uh, [hidden] hole. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But, ya know, not] all [of] them [are actually] worth going into. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One cool thing [about] "Golvellius..." {is} the [old] ladies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When ya try [to] buy [an item without enough] cash, you'll [get] a string of insults hurled [at] ya. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] almost always [worth tryin' to] buy something you [can't] afford, [just to] see [what] the old lady [will] say. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 All told, there [are], uh, seven areas [and eight] bosses. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most [of] the bosses [are relatively] easy, like this [giant hermit] crab. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Probably] the [toughest parts are actually] the [overworld] sections. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "...Zelda", [where overworld] enemies [are pretty] easy [to] kill, "[Golvellius]..." has [infinitely] respawning enemies, many of which are much [faster than] you - flying enemies especially; they tend [to] come [at] you from multiple directions [at] once. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And it will] be [impossible to] dispose of all these guys [without] taking [some] damage. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If you're [not] trying [to] find a hidden cave [or] earn money, [it actually] makes more sense to enter [and] exit a screen as quickly [as possible]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That] way, [you won't get hit] by flying enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The 3rd Level (the Graveyard level) is full of very dangerous guys [that can] wear [down your Health] Bar very quickly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So] the [overworld's] a [bit] more intense [than] "...Zelda". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Throughout] the game, you'll buy [expensive (yet] very [helpful]) equipment, such [as better] swords, shields, boots, [that sort] of thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Other [than equipment and] health potions, you [also] need Bibles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These are -- [for] some reason, increase the max [amount] of cash you [can] carry. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Without] Bibles, you [won't] be able [to collect enough] cash [to] buy most [of] the [items]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you [collect] all the upgrades, [at] the end [of] the game, you'll [be] able [to] carry [about 100,000] Gold [and] have about [20] Life Tanks. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, [and the music] changes when [ya get] new swords. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "[Golvellius]..." does screw [with] the players [just] a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] the dungeons, you [can't] scroll backwards. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Often], you're forced to pick a path [out of several] choices, [and] some [of] the choices [result in] dead [ends]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If [you] do get stuck in such [a] dead end, [you'll] be forced to [exit the] dungeon [and then start] all over [again]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, a [bit of] memorization (or luck) is [required]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Other than better] swords, [you need to] buy such -- items, such as [boots that'll allow ya to] walk on [water, and later boots that allow you to] walk over [almost] anything. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [These] boots [will] open up some [previously] inaccessible ([but important]) areas, [and] also [allow ya to] access [shortcuts between the different] areas. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One cool thing [about] the [water] boots - you [can stand] on the [water] where land [enemies can't] reach you [and] easily pick them off [without] fear [of] reprisal. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Good [for] grinding Gold. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll also find a ring, which allows you [to destroy certain] rocks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, [this is required] to advance [at] a [certain] point. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya learn [about almost] all these [things from] the cryptic "...[Zelda]"-like [hints] the fairies give. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [pendant increases your] defense. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Unfortunately], all this stuff costs [a lot] of money, which [means you have to] kill lots [of] enemies [for] Gold over [and] over again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Something else [that's not very] cool is this boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Most] bosses [are pretty] easy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This one takes way too long [to] kill. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have [to] run up [and hit] 'em, like, a million [times before] they die. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Because [they're] so quick, [this] is [actually quite] a pain, [and the fight] is way too long, dangerous, [and] grueling. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [We're actually getting pretty] near the end, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [found some boots that allow] me [to] walk over trees. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, the game starts [out in a desert]-like environment, then moves [you] to a rather gloomy graveyard area. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] the last two [levels are] rather [pleasant]-looking [forest] levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Usually, the [last] levels [in] these [sorts of] games are, [like], ya know, scary [Mount] Doom, ya [know],-type -- -type [part of] the game world. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Here's] a cool [but pretty] easy boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He [or] she is a headbanger, I guess. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The boss [moves at the] same speed [that] you do, so they [can follow] you around doing [constant] damage [if you're not] careful. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Eventually], you'll find [Golvellius]' lair, hidden by this dead tree. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The final level's a side-[scrolling] level [with multiple giant] snakes, [and] then [Golvellius], himself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It helps [to have] this special herb [that will] refill [your] Life Bar when [it] runs out ([sorta] giving ya, like, [an] extra [instant] life). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The one thing I do wish is [that] enemies [gave some sort] of visual clue when you did damage [to them]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As [it] is, um, there's [only], like, a [little] annoying sound effect when [you successfully, you] know, strike [them with your] sword. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, once [you've defeated Golvellius], then you've [beaten] the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, the ending (as told through a cutscene) is a [little] unusual, [by video] game standards. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya know, ya rescue the [Princess, of] course, [but] the seven crystals [you've been] collecting [will] bring [Golvellius] back [to] life. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Since he's] no longer [possessed] by demons or [whatever], he decides [to] join you in [your] further [adventures], which I guess [set] up a sequel [that] never [really] happened. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There was a [sort] of sequel made, [but it] was a goofy cooking-themed game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Certainly, "Golvellius..." outclasses] any "...Zelda" clones we've seen on [the] FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] far [better] looking [than] "...Zelda", itself. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Though [it] lacks the [creativity and originality] of "...[Legend of] Zelda", [and] it's [not without its] flaws, [this is definitely] one [of] the [better Master System] games we've seen so far. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you like Compile's "...Guardian Legend", I would [seriously] recommend "[Golvellius]...". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shinobi 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 16 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Hey! It's "Shinobi", a game about shinobis (also known [as] ninjas). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, [literally], 'shinobi' means 'stealth'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 See [this] guy [on the title] screen? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That's] a stealthy-lookin' ninja. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya know who's not stealthy? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Joe Musashi, who walks around in plain [sight] where [everyone can] see [him and doesn't] even bother [putting] on his ninja mask. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [bottom] line? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Joe is more about kicking ass, rather than stealth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's [only slightly] less obvious [than] Bill [and] Lance [from] "Contra". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [if] you [thought] ninjas were assassins [or] something, you're wrong. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Joe is here [to] rescue [kidnapped] children. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ninjas are [just] like Godzilla; they're all [about] helping the children. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [obviously], this [is] a [port] of Sega's [1987] Arcade game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "[Shinobi]" was nothing [at] all like Sega's loud, flashy, Super Scaler games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] was a much less hectic side-scrolling Action Game [that greatly] resembled Namco's "Rolling Thunder" [and] was [notable] for (among other things) one [of] the [enemies] being clearly based on Spider-Man. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [Master System] game changes [up quite] a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] gives you a Life Bar, [for] example, [and it also] makes ya play these horrendous minigames [between] levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [have to shoot] ninjas [before] they reach you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] really hard! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Beating] this [will grant] ya some Ninja Magic. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Level 2 features both the Andy Warhol-esque posters of Marilyn [Monroe and] the Spider-Man enemy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], there [are] five areas (each broken down [into] a few levels each). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] the end of each area [is] a boss - a gigantic ninja-lookin' dude, in this case. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya need to hit him] in the face, while avoiding [his] fireballs. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [second] boss, called Black [Turtle], is ([get] this) a helicopter - or maybe a guy who's flying the helicopter. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though your [Wanted sheet] actually shows the helicopter, [not] the guy, [which doesn't really make] much sense. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, helicopters [are] mass-[produced]; there's [gotta] be a thousand other helicopters [out] there, [just like] this one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Each level changes the [environments quite] a bit, [and] new enemies appear [on] a regular basis. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As ya may have [noticed], most levels [feature] two floors. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Holding Up [or] Down [on] the D-Pad while ya jump will cause ya [to] switch floors. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [if] an enemy is hiding behind a crate [or] something, ya [might be able to] switch floors [and] come [around] behind [him]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing I love is, when you, uh, [get] the kids, they go flying off diagonally through the air (like ya kicked 'em off-screen [or] somethin'). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] by the way, uh, rescuing kids is actually optional. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] doing so [will get] ya bonuses, such as refilling [your] Life Bar, extending [your] Life Bar, [getting better] weapons, [and] so on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And ([trust] me) you'll need the extended Life Bar in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This boss, [for] example, rather [irritating]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] think if ya have the default shurikens, he's [pretty] much [impossible to defeat]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [just can't] throw 'em fast enough, [so ya] need [to] have a powered-up weapon, here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [He's] a two-part boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [second part] is this face, [which] throws bouncy fireballs at ya - a piece [of] cake [if] ya stand [right in front] of [him]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 After this, things start [to get] a [little] hairy when crazy flying ninjas [start] jumping [out] of nowhere at ya. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Which raises the obvious question, '🍪🍊🍓 Joe Musashi is a ninja. 🍇🍪🍊🍓 Why can't he jump [around] like this? 🍇🍪🍊🍓 Why can't he do crazy [surprise] attacks? 🍇'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [unfortunately], the game does have [just, sort] of, one [particular] moment [that kinda] brings the game down. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Shinobi"'s moment of tomfoolery is [right] here: this jump. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Let's] try [that] again. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here we [go]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([Shoot] the bad guy first.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! I was right on the edge when I [jumped]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeh, [it] seems like you literally hafta be standing on the last pixel on [that platform, in] order [to] make the [jump]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Thanks, Sega, [for] tryin' [to] kill us with one [stupid] jump like [that]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There [isn't] really much [difficult platforming in this] game, though [there] are a few "Ninja Gaiden"-esque [moments of] enemies [hitting] you [midair and knocking] you into a [bottomless] pit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, [now] this boss (a [giant] samurai) is called 'Lobster' (because he's red, I guess). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Beating] him's all [a matter of] timing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [need to shoot him] when [the] sword is lowered a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [kinda sorta] need [to get in] the groove when [fighting] this guy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, on the final level, Sega turns up the [heat] a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [start out getting pummeled] by [surprising] s... -- flying ninjas, coming from every direction. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Memorization (or advancing very slowly) is [the] key, here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In general, though, "[Shinobi]" is best played cautiously. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [can't] just rush in or you'll [take] too many bullets [in] the face. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [if] ya do manage [to] make [it to] the [last] level alive, I [recommend] playing very carefully - [rescuing] all the kids {to} [get] {a} health refill so [that] you [can] reach the final boss with a [relatively] full Health Bar. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the [Masked] Ninja boss is sometimes [considered difficult] because you hafta use [specific] tactics [to defeat] each form. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} first time [you're] playing, [you're] gonna have no idea what to do, because these tactics are really [not] very obvious. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If ya [don't] know [what you're] doing, [you're] gonna [get killed real] quick. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [for his first] form, ya [need to hit him] in the [approximately] 1/20th {of} a second [that his] shield [is] down. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Once again, [it's] all a [matter of] timing.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When [he] switches [to] Hurricane Form, use a melee attack, [right] when [he] reaches you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For his Shadow Double Form, [hit him right] when [he touches] the ground. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then, in [his] final Piledriver Attack, trap him [between] you [and] the wall [and just] keep pummeling him. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a tough [battle], and a [little] cruel [because] you really [can't] mess [up] more [than] a couple times [without] dying. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But finally you'll persevere, [defeat] the [Masked] Ninja, [rescue] the kids, [and] are [finished with] the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] now ya finally [get to] see the end of "Shinobi"! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hmm... I see. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, screw you too, Sega. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kujaku Ou 🇯🇵 // SpellCaster 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We've almost [reached] the end here, folks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hmm... 🍇

✅🍪🍋🍓 [Lightning] strikes a temple! 🍇

✅🍪🍋🍓 (Very ominous!) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Hey! This looks familiar! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Why, [in fact], this is "Kujaku Ou". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If ya saw "Chrontendo ... [36]", then ya know we saw this game ([better] known [in] the West as "SpellCaster"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] the U.S., [it got] a more boring [title] screen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The Master System "Kujaku Ou" came [out] in [August and] the FamiCom one came [out in] September, so 'Chronsega' [and] 'Chrontendo' are [right about] lined up, now. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [both] series have reached early fall [1988]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Remember], of course, there [was] also an M.S.X. [release], as well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 All the versions [start out] the same, with the Peacock King talking [to] this guy [about] the attack on a temple. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] they [follow] the same plot (ya know, since they were based on a [manga]) [but] the FamiCom [and] M.S.X. games were Adventure [Games] with R.P.G. turn-[based] battles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, someone ([presumably] Sega) heavily [reworked] the game [for] the Master System, [and] the [Adventure] Game [interface] is [really only] used {at} [certain] points. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, [and] this is funny. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [If you] waste time talkin' [to this] guy, he'll call you an [idiot and] tell ya [to get] out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well], anyway, huge chunks [have] been ripped [out of the original] game [and] replaced [with] side-scrolling Action sequences. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So [it feels] a [bit] more like "Shinobi" [or] "Rastan". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I dunno if any major changes [were] made [for] the U.S. version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The most] obvious thing is the [protagonist's outfit]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the Japanese game, he wore, [like], this, uh, flowing robe thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S. game, [it was obviously] altered [to] look more [like] a "Kung-Fu Master"-type [outfit]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [at] the [end of] each Action sequence, you reach [your] destination (usually a temple) [and] then ya [get] a [little bit] of Adventure Gaming. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Mostly], this [consists of] you [talking to] people, [and] these scenes help [advance] the plot. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Izumo? [That's] a famous temple [in] Japan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Shouldn't] this guy know that? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [He's] a [Japanese] guy [who] hangs [out in] temples, after all. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So [ya] talk [to] this guy, then ya head back, talk [to] the [old] guy some more, he'll tell ya Izumo's a temple, then ya head to Izumo, then more [side]-scrolling sequences. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] the temple ya find a bad guy, [and] then ya [get] a boss fight! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 After you [defeat him], he'll [provide some] exposition, then ya head back [to] the old guy, [et cetera]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] that's [sorta] how the game goes, [at least for] the first half. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Unfortunately], the [Adventure] Game segments [aren't] really [any better] here [than] they were [in] the FamiCom game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In fact, maybe] they're worse! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [mostly] a [matter] of looking, talking, [and] occasionally picking up [or] using [an item, but] the game [can] be stubbornly illogical [at] times. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 'Take some [spaghetti]!', the guy says. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sure! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya hit 'Take' and... "There's nothing [to] take.". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hmm... I'll [look] again. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, {the} [spaghetti]'s still there; [he] still wants me [to] take it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Why can't I pick [it] up? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the Action sequences aren't [as] polished as they could be. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like, hey! How did I miss [that platform]? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess, [if] the back of [your] heel on one leg is on the [edge of a platform], you'll [just] magically fall [right through] the [platform]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, enemies [can] respawn, like, way too quick. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Look at] this; [he didn't even have time to, like], walk past where [that] orange thing was! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And he reappears, like, a [second] after I [shot it]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [I bet] this enemy came [straight out of] the manga version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Just look [at] the guy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [about] the spells... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have [the] same spells [as in the] FamiCom game, [and] they [can] be used in the Action sections. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Fudo unleashes a [powerful] fireball. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That's what I'll] use [to] take [out] this guy, when I [get] a chance. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The magic [can] be a [little bit] awkward [to] use. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You need to] hold down the [button and] then squat. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If an enemy hits you [while you're] tryin' [to] squat, this [cancels] the magic [attack]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, [and] by the way, the, uh, 'STrenGtH' up there - that is your L... -- Life Bar or [your Hit Points]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And 'E-N-G-Y' is [your Magic Points]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's another rage-inducing [moment], here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's stuff on the ground, [but] when you look, the game tells ya there's nothing strange there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [let's look at that sword that] looks like the famous Japanese seven-branched sword. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {That's} [probably important, so] we [better] take that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] ya try, and... "There's nothing [to] take.". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well], yes, there is - the sword! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Why can't I pick up the sword? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And that's] how this game [tends to] go. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If [you're] wondering, you hafta look [at] the sword a [second] time [before] the game [will let you] pick [it] up, [for] some mysterious reason. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the [Adventure] Game [parts are] really [infuriating]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The side-scrolling parts are [pretty repetitive]; you go [to], like, five temples [in] a row, and they're all [pretty] similar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A couple are [pretty] much identical. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Later], the game does mix [it] up a [bit]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have [to] rescue a girl [from] a sea monster, [but] the game gives [you] no clues as [to how to] do this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It involves] casting a series of three spells. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] since the game [gives] you no in-game [descriptions] of [what your] spells do, [there's really] no way [to] figure this [out, unless] ya [have] a manual or a walkthrough. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "SpellCaster" [isn't] a terrible game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] plays [like] a side-scrolling Action Game with [interactive] cutscenes [between] levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This gives [it] much more plot [than most similar] games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] the execution of both the [Adventure and] the Action sequences really [don't quite] live up [to] the concept. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nekkyuu Koushien 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 09 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Only] one game released [in] Japan [in] September, and it's a Baseball Game, "Nekkyuu Koushien" (or "Hot Pitch Koushien"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Koushien Stadium is where the High School baseball [tournaments take] place. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So I guess [this is] a High School Baseball Game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya choose [your] name [and] team, number of players, level, and then ya [get started]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, I was a [little] intrigued, because I [noticed that] on 'S.M.S. Power's entry [for] this game, they called [it] 'maybe the [best] Baseball Game [for] the system'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Which sounds [pretty good, until] ya realize, 'There really [aren't that] many Baseball Games on the [Master] System.'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But it] still is a [pretty] good game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Pitching controls [are] standard. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] one nice touch is the outfielder control. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [They actually start] running towards [the] ball automatically, which means ya have a good chance [of actually] catching a fly ball. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] throwing a ball works [just about] like you [expect]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Batting] is, once again, a [simple matter of pressing] the [button]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Actually making [contact with] the ball [isn't] too [difficult], unlike some games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I [actually got] a couple good hits in. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, back [when we were] discussing "Super Real Baseball" [for] 'Chrontendo', I [complained about that] horrible background ruckus in every single Baseball Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] a commenter [informed] me [it was] supposed [to represent] these cheer squads called ouendan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They make [an] appearance [in] this game, actually; [you can] see them [beating] on the taiko drums. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They'd look like High School kids, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [There's] also even dancing cats in one scene. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [So], this game has [responsive controls], no obvious gameplay flaw [that] I encountered, has these [cute little animated] cutscenes [between] various plays. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [certainly not] the best-looking Baseball Game ever, [but] I found it [to] be [pretty] enjoyable. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 R-Type 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 01 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by IREM | Compile 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our [last] game this episode [and] the first game of October is, once again, a port [of an] Arcade classic. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] unlike a number of games we've seen this episode, the Master System "R-Type" [achieves considerable fidelity to] the source material. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] terms of [layout], gameplay, weapons, enemy types, [that sorta] thing, the Master [System] "R-Type" is [virtually identical to] the Arcade game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, sure, the [music] is a bit tinny [and] the graphics [don't] look [quite] as nice, [but] this would be extremely impressive [if it weren't for] one [little] thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A few [months] prior, "R-Type" was released on the P.C. Engine (the Japanese TurboGrafx-16). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This version was [the] most impressive Arcade-[to-console] conversion ever, [at] this point. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] fact [that {a} pretty] much perfect home version of "R-Type" [already] existed makes the [Master System] game look [not quite so] special. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Which is a shame because after the [botched] ports [of] "Thunder Blade", "Vigilante", [and] the like, "R-Type" is a big step up - [certainly] well beyond [what] could've been achieved on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [I mean, it] does play a [little differently than] the Arcade game [in] some subtle ways [that are kind] of hard [to] pinpoint. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I died a few times on [this] level, where I normally wouldn't have [in something like] the P.C. Engine version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It just] felt a [little bit different in] spots. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] when the game tries [to] pull off a big explosion or impressive effect, the [Master System] really [can't] do [it without] the game [getting] all flickery [and] glitchy-lookin'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's one special thing [about] this version - a hidden Bonus Level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] reach [it] from Level 4. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Unfortunately], it's [not very exciting]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] some weird [enemies that] look [kinda like] green raw chickens. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, in a huge mistake, the boss [doesn't] flash when ya [hit him]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So [it looks like you're not doing] any damage. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I assume Sega was [responsible for] the Master [System] version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe they [designed] this new level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It [just] doesn't impress you the way the other levels do. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Still, it's a very commendable [release for] the Master System - if [only] the P.C. Engine's "R-Type" [wasn't] there to [steal] all the [glory]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 6 Wrap Up ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, there we go. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Thus [ends] the Golden Age of the Master System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Not that] there weren't any more good games on the way, [but] after this, the [Master System sorta finds itself] overshadowed by its 16-bit sibling. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Chronsega ... 7" [will] see [the console] stop [releasing] games [in] Japan entirely, [and its] overall [release] schedule [will] slow [down quite] a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, there's still gonna be [plenty] of good exclusive [titles], so [don't quite] count [out] the Master System yet. 🍇🍌
