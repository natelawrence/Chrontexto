👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ A Brief Introduction to Sega ✨


✅🐢🍊🍓 [While] Sega [hasn't] been around as long as *Nintendo* has, they *are* still one of the oldest companies in the video game *field*. 🍇

✅🐢🍊🍓 Of the two console giants, Sega [has] always seemed to be the more Western-orientated of the two, and they *have* had more success outside of *Japan*, in places like the *Americas* [and] *Europe*. 🍇

✅🐢🍊🍓 Perhaps this is not *surprising*, since Sega was founded, *not in Japan* but in the [United] *States*, in *Hawaii* in *1940* by Martin *Bromley* as '*Standard Games*', [providing amusement machines] *for* U.S. soldiers. 🍇🍌


✅🐢🍊🍓 In 1951, [reportedly] due to governmental *restrictions*, Standard Games moved to *Japan*, changing [its] name to '*Service* Games', and [flourished primarily] as a [distributor] of [jukeboxes, slot] machines, pinball machines, and so on, eventually merging into a Japanese company called Nihon Goraku *Bussan*. 🍇

✅🐢🍊🍓 *Meanwhile*, Brooklyn-born businessman David *Rosen* had become *quite successful* importing arcade machines [*into*] Japan with *his* company, Rosen Enterprises. 🍇

✅🐢🍊🍓 In 1964, Service Games [and] Rosen Enterprises *merged*, with Rosen becoming the C.E.O.. 🍇

✅🐢🍊🍓 Rosen remained as *head* of Sega until 1983, when he became the C.E.O. of Sega of *America*. 🍇🍌


✅🐢🍊🍓 In the 1960s, the newly reorganized *Sega* began manufacturing Arcade games themselves, with their first big hit being "Periscope" in 1966. 🍇

✅🐢🍊🍓 Having become [quite successful], Sega ended up being [purchased] by the American media conglomerate, Gulf [and] Western, who were also the owners of Paramount *Pictures*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Up [until] the mid-1970s, Sega continued to make the kind of mechanical Arcade games {that} were [quite popular] in both the West [*and*] Japan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *But* had [also] begun manufacturing *"Pong"* clones, [and later] *on* in the decade [it started producing] "*Space* [Invaders]" clones. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As the video game [market] exploded, Sega [continued to produce] more games [and introduce] the now familiar Sega logo. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 By the early '80s, Sega had several huge Arcade *hits* under their belt, such as "*Frogger*" and "*Zaxxon*" one of the first isometric *perspective* games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Throughout] the decade, Sega continued to [produce] innovative new titles [and] *made a big impression* on Arcade gamers with their pioneering 3D [effects in] games such as "Hang-On", "OutRun", [and] "*Space* Harrier". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega games [often stood out in] the arcade with their [impressive] cabinets. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Many of Sega's big games were [designed] by leading [designer] Yu [*Suzuki*], who [might] be considered, [sort] of, Sega's answer to [Shigeru] Miyamoto. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ 1981: S.G.-1000 Released ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 Even as Sega *positioned* itself [to] be one [of] the leading Japanese Arcade game *[manufacturers]*, they [began] looking [at] the *home* market. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In *1981*, during the height of videogame *mania*, Sega [released] its first home console, the S.G.-*1000* in Japan, *followed* by very limited [releases] in Europe [and] elsewhere. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The S.G.-1000 was contemporary with the Atari [2600, and] the *Intellivision* [but was quite powerful] for [its] time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A [decent selection] of *games* were [released for] the system, including a [port] of Sega *Arcade* titles such as "*Zaxxon*", Arcade [ports from] *other* companies [such as] "Elevator Action", [and] "*Bomb* Jack", Computer games [such as] "Lode Runner", Sports Games, [and even] a [port] of the early Japanese R.P.G., "Black Onyx". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ 1983: Sega Ports for Atari 2600 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 In *1983*, Sega [began] releasing *console* games *in* the U.S. for the [2600 and] the *Intellivision*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the U.S. [market] collapsed [around] this *time*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ 1985: S.G.-1000 Mark III ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 By *1985*, Nintendo's *FamiCom* [had] become *very* successful *in* Japan [and was] *soon* {to} be [released] in the *U.S.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The S.G.-*1000*, [while only] four years *old, seemed a little old-fashioned*, so *Sega* greatly [improved] on the system's *hardware* [and released] the Sega S.G.-1000 Mark *III* on October 25th *1985*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Mark III was completely *compatible* [with] the old S.G.-1000 {and} SG-1000 Mark *II* games [but] the [*capabilities* of] the system were *far* beyond anything seen in the home console market at this *time*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As a *comparison*, the Mark III had *16 kilobytes* of video RAM [and] could display 32 colors on screen [at] *once*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Whereas] the *FamiCom* had [only] *2 kilobytes* [of video] RAM, some additional *sprite* RAM, [and] could display *16* colors [at] once, in addition [to] having a slower C.P.U.. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ 1986: S.G.-1000 Mark III Released overseas as Master System ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, [Sega] wasted no *time* [getting] the Mark III [onto] the *U.S.* market, [hitting] the shelves in June *1986*, shortly after the N.E.S. {had} become [available *nationally*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., the system was dramatically *redesigned* [and renamed] the Sega *Master* System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, the Mark III [would] be [renamed] the Master System in Japan as well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Despite* the system's technical [superiority], the *Master System never* really took off in the U.S. either. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Numerous *theories* have been *[floated]* as [to] why this *is*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe [it was] the lack of good *games*, or the [fact that] third-party publishers were [prevented] by Nintendo [from putting] games [*out* for] the Master System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe [it was] the horrible *box art* [and] generally bad marketing by *Tonka*, the system's U.S. [*distributor*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For whatever reason, the Master System is considered a failure in both Japan where releases [were reduced] to a [mere] *trickle* by [late] *1988* and [in] the U.S., where new titles ceased [to] come out by 1990, right during the height of the N.E.S.' popularity. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, the Master System did take {on} a life of its own *elsewhere* in *Europe*, Brazil, [Australia and] New *Zealand*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Master System conti...--...tinued [to] sell [in] those markets [until] the mid-*'90s*, when many *Mega* Drive or *Genesis* games were *ported* [to the] Master System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Amazingly*, official [releases] continued in Brazil until *1998* - well [into] the PlayStation [and] *Saturn* era, thus giving the system a respectful *lifespan of around* 13 *years*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Altogether, the system sold around 15 million units, a fraction of what the *N.E.S.* sold, but more [than] the Saturn [or] *Dreamcast* [and enough to keep the] system from being considered a complete failure. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega launched the Mark III with *two* titles, "Hang-On" and "Teddy Boy Blues", but they did manage [to get another] seven [titles out before] the end [of] the year, all [published] by Sega *themselves* and on the Sega Card *format*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Mark III had both a cartridge slot and {a} slot [for] the smaller flat cards. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These cards [had also] been used for the earlier S.G.-*1000* games, the Sega Cards could hold 256 kilobits whereas, by comparison, many *Nintendo* [cartridges] at this time held 320 or even 512 kilobits. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hang-On 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 October 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega kicks off the Mark *III*, [just] like Nintendo did, uh, [for] the FamiCom two years earlier, with a [popular] *Arcade* title - in this case, "Hang-*On*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Hang-On" was a Sega Arcade [hit] released earlier [in] the *year*, [and] was *noted* [for] the [fact that] you *played* [it] sitting on a Motorcycle that actually *tilted* back [and] forth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These [kinds] of Super Deluxe arcade presentations were [*starting] {to} be seen* in the mid-1980s. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the Arcade version [designed] by Yu [Suzuki]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Hang-On*" was clearly modeled after "*Pole* Position" [except] with *Motorcycles* instead of *cars*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The pseudo-3D *technology* was *quite impressive* [at] the *time*, [and] this, sort of, thing would go on {to} become, [sort] of, a specialty [for] Sega. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Note what] appear [to] be all the in-game advertisements for Shell [and] Bridgestone. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And of course, the game feature very impressive fiery explosions when ya *crashed*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *here's* the Mark III *version*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, [it can't] replicate the *Arcade* graphics, but it's *still* very *nice*-looking. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As a point of comparison, let's look at Nintendo's "*Mach* Rider" which was released [around] the same *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom really struggles with the [3D] *graphics* [and] the *game* is [pretty] choppy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Hang-On" is silky smooth next [to] "Mach Rider", and it's much easier [to] play. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The sprites [are] more detailed [and] the color [is] much *brighter*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Mark III was [capable] of ...sp... -- displaying more *colors* [than] the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [what about] the game *itself*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's [your pretty] basic 'drive [your] vehicle [around curves and don't *hit*] anything' kind of *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya need [to complete] each course in a [set amount of] *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Crashing [your] bike [will not] *kill* you, [but it] does [waste valuable] *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The collisions are not nearly as spectacular as the *Arcade* versions, but they still look reasonably *cool*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *controls* of "Hang-On" are *basic* and *effective*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Perhaps] the [only] *complaint* is [that] the animation of your *bike* when you *lean* is a little rough. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Each area has, [sort] of, a [different] theme. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here we're in the Seaside, uh, Level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, we've moved on to Monument Valley. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Certainly] the *environments* [are] a lot more detailed {and} convincing than those in "Mach Rider". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Hang-On" [is] a rather simple *game* and -- [but it's] fun [to] *play* and certainly demonstrates what the Mark III is *capable* of. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Teddy Boy Blues 🇯🇵 // Teddy Boy 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 October 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 A rather nice [little] music theme *there*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the Mark III's *other* launch title "Teddy Boy *Blues*", a [port] of Sega's recent Arcade title (seen here). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The console version is missing the nutty musical intro. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... We'll discuss [that] music in [just] a sec. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Teddy Boy Blues" is [probably not that] well [remembered] *in* the United States, but [it] must [have] been [pretty popular] in *Japan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The music is rather *catchy*, [and] the *title* actually *comes* from a 1985 *song* by a Japanese *singer* named, Yohko Ishino. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That was Yohko you saw singing in the [introduction to] the *Arcade* version a [second] ago. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Apparently the song was [popular] enough to name a videogame after [it]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, what's a "Teddy Boy" ya wonder? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, in the U.K. in the 1950s Teddy Boys were, [sort] of, well dressed rock [and] roll [fans] who usually sported elaborate hairstyles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They didn't get along with mods apparently. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Teddy, by the way, [refers] to the Edwardian period clothing they wore (velvet collars [and] whatnot). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 What does all this [have to] do [with] the game *itself*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Nothing, [as] far as *I* [can] tell. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Teddy Boy Blues" [is] a typical Platformer {of} the mid-'80s; you go around shooting enemies that then t... -- cause them to ch... -- [shrink] down [into little] balls which you must then collect. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Enemies emerge [out] of *boxes*, uh, which all contain a certain number of enemies, you can tell how many [are] left by the number of dots on the *side* [of] the box. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game is well [designed but] also a [little] bit frustrating [in] *places*; [only] so many enemies [will] be out [of] the boxes [at] any one time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] this *sounds helpful*, [it] means that [enemies] pop [out] whenever you collect a ball. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The balls often *land* on the *boxes*, making [it] dangerous to collect them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And on some levels enemies have a [tendency] to *land* on you, since they jump out *quite* a ways when jumping off a *platform*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I *routinely* [got *hit*] by enemies, uh, thinking they'd be landing in *front* of me. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, as in a game this vintage there is a Bonus Round. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You go around collecting various little items found hidden in [the] boxes. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, while "Teddy Boy Blues" [and] "Hang-On" were both released *on* the Mark III's *launch* day, "Teddy Boy..." is, I *suppose* the official first release [for] the *system*, since it has a catalog number *501* whereas "Hang-On" is *502*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though [as] far [as] demonstrating the Mark III's technical capabilities, it certainly seems to [have] taken a *backseat*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess this game *must* [have] been [pretty] *[popular]* in Japan in order for Sega to release it on the Mark III's *launch* day. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Great Soccer 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 October 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Released [just] a week after launch, "Great Soccer" is Sega's first *original* game [for] the Mark III, (assuming, of course, [that] you [can] consider something as basic as this sort of *Soccer* Game [to] be '*original*'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was also the first in the Sega Sports series [for] the Mark III - all with the name, uh, 'Great...' in the title. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Obviously], this brings Nintendo [to] mind with their earliest [releases for] the FamiCom all being either *Arcade* ports or *Sports* titles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess that is actually [pretty] standard for new *consoles*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [what can we] say [about] the game [itself]? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, calling any game 'Great'... 

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([And] I should [point out {the} fact] this stadium has [an] advertisement for 'MILK', uh, behind the, um -- the goalposts there.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Calling any game 'Great', uh, is, [sort] of, asking [for] trouble, especially with a quickie title like this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega does -- they deviate from [Nintendo]'s "Soccer" *format* by having the field positioned *vertically*, not *horizontally*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Great Soccer" actually looks, sort of, like "10-Yard *Fight*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Rather than the realistically [proportioned] guys from the *Nintendo* game, we *have these*, uh, rather *ugly* [little] super-[*deformed*] guys, *all* of which are *cross*-eyed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game [*does*] have an easily visible *red arrow* [that] points {to} the player [that] you [are] currently *controlling*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *[that's actually]* a rather nice *touch*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If ya wanna *pass* the ball, a *white* arrow [will designate the] player [that] the ball [will] *go* to. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] naturally you [can], uh, kick the ball, pass it, the usual stuff. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Just like real Soccer, the scores tend [to] be *low* since it's much easier [to] have a goalkeeper *catch* the ball, 😄 than [it] is *to* actually, uh, make, uh, a *point*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Scoring a goal is *pretty* difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The graphics [and] sound [are pretty] unimpressive [and] "Great Soccer" is certainly not a, uh -- [what you'd] call a demonstration [title for] the Mark *III*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In other words, while "Great Soccer" is [not] bad for a *very early release*, it certainly [doesn't] look, um, like a [lot of] time [and] effort [went] into it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hell! Maybe this was originally developed as an S.G.-*1000* title. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega themselves apparently didn't think too highly of "[Great] Soccer" and they never *released* [it] in the U.S.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Instead, they published *another better* Soccer Game, "*World* Soccer", and then [released] *that* in the U.S. [under the title] of "[Great] Soccer". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fushigi no Oshiro Pit Pot 🇯🇵 // Pit-Pot 🇬🇧 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 14 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 After taking a break [for] a couple months, Sega released a new [title] in mid-*December*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, just like "Great] *Soccer*", this is an original *[title* for] the Mark III, "Fushigi no Oshiro Pit Pot". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While "...Pit Pot" isn't really *spectacular*, it is {an} interesting *[title]* in the way [that it] bears a superficial resemblance to "...Legend of *Zelda*", which would be released about two [months] after this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's the top-down interior *viewpoint*, the foreshortened *walls* [and] *doors*, the keys required to *unlock* the doors - all this [appeared in] "...*Zelda*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, of course, *none* of these elements are really completely *original*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Still, [it] is [an interesting] coincidence. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "...Pit Pot" has you controlling a very [short] knight [that] actually, uh, (from the behind, at least) bears [an interesting] resemblance to the Prince from "Katamari Damacy". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You need to rescue a Princess, [but] a rather *strange* one because [your] *main* objective is [to collect] the [boxes of] *treasure* scattered [around the] castle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Collecting all the treasure in a room [will] sometimes [net] you a *key*, [but] *other* times you'll [have to perform] some [kind] of special *task* [in] order [to get] the key. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [despite] being a knight, [your] weapon is [not] a *sword*, [but] rather a [giant] *mallet*, which you [can] use [to] *crush* enemies [and] knock [out] the grey blocks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *gold* blocks [are] *anchored* [and can't] be knocked out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] *cause* a [large] *section* of the gray blocks [to] drop [into] the *pit* by knocking *out* all the blocks [that are] connected {to} [the] stationary *gold* blocks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, in a [lot] of cases this is difficult {to} do, [simply because] there's a [lot] of *blocks*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There're, of course, various objects [to] pick up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Their meanings are [not] always *obvious*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For *example*, the [*heart* will] freeze all enemies on [the] *screen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Later games would tend [to] use something (oh) [that] makes a [bit] more *sense* like, say, a stopwatch [for] this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] "...Pit Pot" is a [cute little] Puzzlish, [sort] of, game, I [get] the impression this was knocked [out pretty] quickly by Sega. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The graphics [are] very *simple* [and] really this could've been done on the *FamiCom*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess "...Pit Pot" falls [into] the same general -- general category as "BomberMan" (which was [in] fact [released] for the FamiCom [*around*] the same time as [this] - I think maybe a week [or] two [later]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Unfortunately* [for] "...Pit Pot" the Hudson [title is actually] a [lot] more fun [to] play. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] "...Pit Pot" suffers [from] a rather unfair *ending*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When you *reach* the *Princess*, if ya haven't collected every single *treasure*... the greedy bitch *kills* you! Game [*Over*]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Definitely not] the way [to make] gamers happy! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "...Pit Pot" - interesting game, but really hardly [superior to] the, [sort] of, things [that] were being released on the FamiCom, [at] this time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Great Baseball 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "[Great] *Baseball*" (the [second in] Sega's earlier Sports series) was released the day after "...Pit Pot". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [it] *appears* [that] Sega has embarked on a spree of [putting out] games [for] the 1985 holiday *season*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, the same thing was happening with the *FamiCom* with Namco, Taito, Capcom, Irem, Bandai, Enix, Hudson, [and] *others* all [releasing] games [right] before the year's end. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom certainly had superiority in *numbers* with *17* [releases] as compared to the Mark III's six. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As for Sega's "Great Baseball", well, this is the Japanese game - actually a *different game* [than] the one [that] came [out in] the U.S. [under] the name "[Great] Baseball". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or rather, [*that*] game was a [substantially] we... -- *reworked* version of *this* one with [*completely* different] *graphics*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, *upon playing* "[Great] Baseball", ya *might* realize [that it] could pass as a reworked version of *Nintendo's* "Baseball", one [of] the very first games [for] the *FamiCom*, back in *1983*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess, uh, the very ideas behind a Baseball video game hadn't really *changed* much since then. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *gameplay* [and] controls [are pretty] similar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Select] one [of] the generic *teams*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then ya have one of [your generic] *players* swing the bat. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The C.P.U. is [*pretty*] good [at] catching [and] *fielding*, though [you *will*] get lucky sometimes. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *timing* of the swings is a [little] different. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The swing felt a [little] *slow* [to] me, [but] I [didn't really] *play* "[Great] Baseball" [enough to get] a good *feel* for it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! There is [one of the] times I [just got] lucky on [that] hit. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [*while*] pitching, you have some basic options, fastball or slowball. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you [can throw to] the bases if the other team is tryin' [to] *steal*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While [fielding, ya] use the D-Pad [to select] which base [to] *throw* to. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's all very [similar] to Nintendo's earlier game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, now here my team is *pitching*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Except [that unlike] *Nintendo's* "Baseball", you [can] *control* [your] own *outfielders* [while you're] running [to] the ball. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Like [many] team *Sports* Games, you control [a group] of players *all* [at] *once*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] see there, they're all moving in exact *unison*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 What this means [is that it] *can* be a [little bit difficult to get your hands] on the *ball* sometimes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you [*think*] the ball [is going to land *between*] two players, if ya move one *towards* the ball [you'll] be moving *another* player *away* [from] the [ball]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Like a [lot of] these games, it's *kind of difficult* [to] know exactly where the ball is going [to] *land*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this *can* occasionally cause you [some] *trouble*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] of course, the ball also tends to be hard [to] catch, [often] passing [right] between [your] *legs*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On the *positive* side, [it] seems the ball *can* kill an umpire. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That] guy doesn't seem [to] be getting *up*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *as* a rule, [like] these Baseball Games, fielding is the most [difficult] part. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *one more* complaint: 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Not only do your outfielders] *move* very slowly, as they -- they tend [to] *do* but they *throw* very slowly! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The ball actually moves *at [about]* the same speed as the *runner*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Obviously], this doesn't [make] real *sense*, um, [and most] Baseball Games *tend* [to] have the ball move *much faster* [than] the guy [you're] running. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But in] a case [like that] when [you're] tryin' to, uh -- you [are] throwing the ball [and] the guy is running [in] the same direction, there's no way [you're] gonna [get him] out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, as I said, I didn't really play "[Great] Baseball" [enough to] master the controls. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But it] *seems* [to] me that calling [it] maybe '*Good* Baseball' or perhaps even '*Average* Baseball' [*might*] be a [bit] more accurate. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It really just is Nintendo's "Baseball" with, uh, slightly, uh, better graphics. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Satellite 7 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Everyone likes Shoot-'em-Ups, right? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Scrolling Shooter games must [have] been quite [popular in] Japan [at] this *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There certainly were [*enough* of] them [released for] the *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, naturally, Sega chose [to] release [not] one but two Shoot-'em-Ups in a row [for] the Mark III. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The boringly titled "Satellite *7*" is the first [and] lesser of the *two*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Right off* the [bat], *here's* a *problem*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you *die* while a wave of enemies is on the *screen*, you *can* respawn [right] in the middle of [that] *wave* (with enemies right on *top* of you). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now this situation captured on video here isn't really that *dire*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But there *have been* times when I have died and respawned [*right*] on top of [an] enemy, thus getting the dreaded Double *Death*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] I've even encountered the *Triple* Death, on occasion. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], of course, in Shoot-'em-Ups this is really considered [to] be [not] fair. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In *general*, though, "Satellite 7" is [just] not a very good *Shooter*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] ship (or tank or [whatever] it is) moves sluggishly, [and] the game lacks much variety. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There *are* [little] *power*-ups here, uh, which are [gotten] by [collecting] the stars; [get enough] of a certain *color* [and you'll get] a *power*-up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Green, [for] example, makes you [temporarily] *invincible*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm not] sure [what] the *other* stars do. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I never [actually got around to *collecting*] another *color*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... One thing though, in general, we [don't] like on [Shoot]-'em-Ups is temporary *power*-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I somehow can't imagine [that] the other power-ups [are] very *spectacular*, however. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Satellite 7" is clearly modeled after Namco's "*Xevious*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] like many of the post-"Xevious"/pre-"Gradius" [Shooters, it isn't] really a [lot] of fun. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The big black borders [and excessively] large *sidebar* [certainly don't *help*] much. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It really gives the game a feeling of, like, one [of] those old *computer* Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [also] have *bombs* [but] they [*don't have* a very] big *blast* range. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And ya need to get] -- basically be an exact hit when ya use 'em. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The first boss is [kind] of weird. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He actually has a *counter* on [him] that tells me any -- how many more hits ya need [to] *kill* him. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Unfortunately*, once you [get] rid of him, he [doesn't] actually explode [or] do anything cool like that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He [just sort] of, slinks away. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah. Yeah, there we go. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's all there is. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Kind] of a shame, really. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, while this game has [colorful] *graphics* which [are pretty] typical [of] the Mark *III, nothing* in the game (the, uh, backgrounds, enemies, weapons, *anything*) has *any* sorta character. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm [*not* even] really sure [if your] *vehicle* is [ground]-*based* [or] *air*-based. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] gonna [have to] call "Satellite 7" a [*disappointment*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Even] by *1985* standards, [it] was way [behind] the times. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Astro Flash 🇯🇵 // TransBot 🇺🇸 // Nuclear Creature 🇧🇷 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I promised [you] two [Shooters] in a *row*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] here's #2 "Astro Flash" (known [as] "TransBot" in the *U.S.* [and for] *some reason* "[Nuclear Creature]" in Brazil). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Released a mere two days after "Satellite *7*", it is [*certainly* the] better title of the *two*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] first [impression will probably] be, 'Wow! This game looks really nice, much better [than] the boring [and] ugly "Satellite 7"!'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] check out that really awesome parallax *scrolling*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I *could be mistaken* [but] *I don't think* we've really *seen* this impressive a use of *parallax* in a console *game* [before]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] really gives the [feeling] of speed [and] *depth missing* in earlier Shoot-'em-Ups [for] home *systems*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *And additionally*, "Astro Flash" even has *power*-ups! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Shooting the livvle -- little, uh, delivery van there will cause a Power Orb [to] fall out; grabbing the Orb [and hitting your] second [button will select] a *power*-up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, you [*can't*] exactly *choose* your power-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] cycles through the [available] power-ups very, very *quickly* [and will] *stop* whenever you [hit] the [*button*], so a [certain amount] of luck is involved. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Unfortunately], the power-ups [are] all *temporary* and [will] run [out] of *time* when the Arm Meter goes all the way to the left. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, you *can* take multiple *hits* and will [only] lose a life when the *Power* Meter runs out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Among the five power-[ups] available are a couple [that will] turn you into a [robot], as we've [already] *seen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Viewers of '*Chrontendo*' [will] know [this is already] a [bit] of a video game *cliche*, [with] several *FamiCom* [titles], uh, featuring robot to, uh -- and ship [transformations], starting with, uh, "Formation Z" all the way back in *early* 1985. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, those Power Orb vans arrive [pretty] frequently, so ya *really* [won't] go too *long* (if [at] all) [without] {a} power-up. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here we've reached the *second* area, which is a more, [ya] know, futuristic type city *again* with [pretty] nice scrolling. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *even* though this game seems like a vast [improvement] over "Satellite *7*", it's *still* far from *perfect*; it's -- it's not exactly "Side Arms...". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The levels [and] enemies are [pretty] repetitive ([and] *literally* so); this *level* [will] loop *infinitely* [until] ya destroy *one [particular] enemy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Unfortunately*], this enemy [can only] be destroyed by one [particular] *weapon*: the *missiles*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, if ya don't *have* the missiles [and] you *encounter* [it], you'll have [to] repeat the entire level [and] try *again*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, this game [will] piss you *off* [quite] a [bit until] ya figure [it] out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here's one [of] the coolest power-ups, [right] here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Strangely*, the *Japanese* release has a catalog number of 503, making [it] sequentially the third Mark III *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, [it] was [released] *after* numbers 504 [and] -- through 407. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [Mark] III games *weren't* always [released] in numerical *order*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was given a *U.S.* [release in] 1986 (unlike "Satellite *7*"), [but] under the name "TransBot" with a Transformer-like [robot] on the *cover* (obviously [an] attempt to cash in on the popular *toy* line). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *And* as a weird *coda* [to] all this, in [1986] Sega [released an] *Arcade* version of "Astro Flash", *this* time known [in] the U.S. [as] simply "*Transformer*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For the *Arcade* version, the whole, uh, 'shooting the [supply] ships' has been *eliminated*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you [can] simply transform back [and forth between] a jet and a robot [at] will, thus giving [it] a "Formation Z"-[like] quality. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Unfortunately*, the *Arcade* game isn't *really* [that] much better than the *console* version, as *far* [as] *I* [can] tell. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 F-16 Fighting Falcon 🇯🇵 // F-16 Fighter 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nexa | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [As] we approach the end of *1985* we have another Shooter of *sorts* "F-16 Fighting *Falcon*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Note] the name *Nexa* in the *credits*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was [released] in *Europe* as "F-16 *Fighter*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] choose [the difficulty] level, [right] off the *bat*, by the number [of] enemy [*fighters*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once the game *starts*, you [might] be [surprised] by the rather unimpressive *graphics*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [definitely] looks a few generations *older* [than] the Mark *III*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [definitely] has the [most limited] *color* palette we've *seen* for the System III, uh, black, white, two shades of blue, green, red, [and] yellow. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If this doesn't *look* like the typical Sega game, well, it's *not*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] actually the [first] Mark III release not developed by *Sega*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 ([Oops], I [just got] myself blown [up immediately], there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I scored zero points.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game was [developed] by *Nexa* (though Sega [presumably *ported*] the game). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "F-16 Fighter" is the [port] of a 1984 M.S.X. Jet [Fighter] Simulation game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This version looks almost [*exactly* like] the M.S.X. version. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Nexa* was an *American* company, uh, [that] released a few games [in] the mid-'80s [and] was *founded* by the noted Silicon Valley personality, Gilman *Louie*, - a fellow who is, *quite frankly*, more [interesting] than this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you saw there, I [just] blew up [one of] the [enemy *fighters*] with my missiles. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [have] *two* forms of weapons here, missiles or the 20 millimeter *machine* gun. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] see by the [little] readout there on the left-hand side I currently have the gun selected. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Louie seemed [to] specialize in F-16 Simulation Games and, uh, r... -- *actually ran* a few *different video* game *companies*, [including] one called Spectrum *HoloByte*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 While [with] them, Louie [secured] the U.S. rights [for] an obscure Russian video game called "Tetris". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I assume he made some money off of *that*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's *nowadays* more known as a financier [and] actually does investment work for the C.I.A.. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As for "F-16 [Fighting] Falcon", well, like a [lot] of Aircraft *Simulation Games*, [it] has [an] overly-complicated display [and] controls. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, you actually have [to] use two game controllers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The D-Pad on the *one* controls [your] *speed*, [and] the D-Pad on the *other* controls your *direction* [and] then the [buttons] do various things. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The main *challenge* of this game is to, [sort] of, master the, uh, complicated controls and figure [out] how to actually use 'em [to shoot] things down. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] trying to right now, uh, speed up [and] catch [that] guy, [right] there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I suppose [that aircraft] freaks [might enjoy] this, [sort] of, thing, [but] probably [everybody] else [will] find [it] a [little bit] *boring*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {For} some [reason, I just can't] seem to lock on... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [we] go. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... [The fact that] Nexa was the first third-party developed game [for] the Mark III indicates what a major lock Nintendo had on the video game *developers* [and] how far afield Sega had [to] go [in order to find] companies willing [to] work with 'em. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Great Tennis 🇯🇵 // Super Tennis 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 December 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Astro Flash", "F-[16] Fighting Falcon", [and] this game, "Great *Tennis*", were all [released] on December *22nd*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this will [conclude] 1985 for the Mark *III*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So far, Sega seems {to} be taking the same path as *Nintendo* did when [it released] the FamiCom [in] 1983. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A few Arcade ports, some Sports Games, a few [original titles]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I earlier remarked on the [similarity] of "[Great] *Baseball*" to *Nintendo's* early "Baseball" *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the same holds true for "Great *Tennis*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's really [just] *Nintendo's* "Tennis" [with brighter] colors. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, there seems [to] be some confusion over the name. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The box says "*Great* Tennis" [and] the screen says "*Super* Tennis". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S. [and] Europe, this game was [released later] as "Super Tennis". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Just like the old Nintendo "Tennis" game, [it] *doesn't* really *advance* on the gameplay of the old Atari *2600* "Tennis" game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Run [up to] the *ball* [and] press the [button to] swing the *racket*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I [didn't] really care for [the] *Nintendo* game [and] I [don't] really [like] this one *either*, [mostly] due [to] the controls seeming [just] a [little] off. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 First of all, serving can be difficult, the ball [frequently] either *hits the net* or [lands *just past*] the *service* line. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I've [actually] lost entire games [strictly] through [hitting] too [many] *faults*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, once ya [get] the ball in *play*, "[Great] Tennis" [doesn't] really seem [that] *bad*, even though the *hit* detection sometimes [is] a [little] wrong. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 At times the game seems [very] *generous* as you [hit] balls that seem outside your racket's *range*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Other times the ball seems [to] pass [right] *through* [your] racket. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing [that's, uh, a little bit] of concern [while] *playing* this game is [your opponent] there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [What exactly] is he *wearing*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] you seem [to] be having s... -- your [sort of] standard *Tennis* shorts, he seems {to} be wearing some kind of bikini brief bottoms. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Like a [lot] of* early Mark III titles, Sega seems to [have, sort] of, phoned this one in. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo's "Tennis" [seemed pretty] impressive in *1983* but by [late] 1985 a game [like] this would seem a [little behind] the *times*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega may be suffering from the same problem Nin(h... --)tendo had [in] the early [days of] the *FamiCom*; they had [to] develop every single title *themselves*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Fortunately* for *Nintendo*, they quickly picked up a [lot] of third-party developers [and] *publishers* [for] the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Sega* would [not] be so lucky. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, 1985 [hasn't] really been [that successful for] the Mark *III*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [only] really game I [can] recommend [without] any *reservations* is "Hang-*On*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Astro Flash" is [not that] *bad*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The other games all seem... (*well*, "...[Pit Pot]", I guess, has its moments). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But for] the [most] part, [not] a [lot of great] games for the Mark III. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully 1986 [we'll] see better luck. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ The First Year of SG-1000 Mark III✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 In 1986 (the Mark III's first full year) a mere 16 *titles* [were released in] Japan, again, all [published] by *Sega*, due mostly [to] Nintendo's, uh, having pretty much every major Japanese publisher [and] developer in their *corner*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still*, Sega *did* take a step [forward] by ditching the Sega Card format [and releasing] games in the Cartridge format, (most [of] which held one megabit, [at] this time). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] June, Sega released the Sega Master System [in] the *U.S.*, though [we'll discuss that] more next time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Seishun Scandal 🇯🇵 // My Hero 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 January 31 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Coreland | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 1986 kicks off *slowly*, [but it] *does* with another Arcade *port*; this time it's "Seishun *Scandal*" (or '*Youth* Scandal'). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is, sort of, {a} very early *Beat*-'em-Up - rather curious [little title]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was originally a 1985 *Arcade* game, in which you travel across town [to] rescue [your] *girlfriend* who [was kidnapped] by some thugs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S. [it] was known [as] "My *Hero*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here is the Arcade version *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] much the same [plot as pretty] much, well, every Beat-'em-Up, going [back to] "[Spartan] X"/"Kung-*Fu* Master". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Arcade* game was *released* by Sega but [developed] by a company [called] *Coreland*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Coreland was later bought out by *Bandai* in the late *1980s*, [and] their name was [changed] to Banpresto. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Nowadays they do g... -- a lot of games based on [licensed] *properties*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here we are [back] to the Mark *III* version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] the Arcade game was a decent [little] *time* waster, the Mark *III* port ([presumably ported] by Sega [*themselves*]) is a whole 'nother *story*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 While it superficially *looks* very [similar, it] *plays* very *differently*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you may have noticed from the gameplay, uh, *video* here, [it] is impossibly [difficult and] you [will] keep *dying*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are often] a [lot] of enemies [on] the screen [at] *once*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the *Arcade* game you [can] just tear right through them quite *easily* [with your punches or] *kicks* (quite similar to "Kung-*Fu* Master"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the *home* version, there seems {to} be some [sort] of, like, [little] *lag* whenever you attack [and it] requires *much* more precision. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll [frequently find] yourselves being [*hit*] by the *enemies* [before] you [can hit] *them*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As a [result], "*Seishun* Scandal"... 

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Well, we just saw [it right] *there*; [I] walked up [to] the guy [and], 'Bam!', he [just knocked] me out.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *game* really is, uh, a bit of a drag and, uh, even playing through... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (See? There's another cheap death [right] *there*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Right] as I walked up [to] the guy [and *hit*] him, he threw a [little] *mine* up in the air [that hit] me [and] *killed* me. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That's really] hardly *fair*.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well], the *Arcade* version actually has three [different] levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a second one; third one have like a Historical theme [and], like, a Science *Fiction* theme. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Mark* III version [just]... 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 (Again, uh, the platforming is a [little] strange; [it looked like] I, [sort] of, jumped [right] through, uh, [that little *platform*] there.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] the U.S., this was [released] as, uh, "My *Hero*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Unfortunately*, they [changed] the [*title*] screen [but] nothing else; it doesn't actually play any better [than] the Mark III version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, as [I] was mentioning, the, uh -- the home version [only] has one level basically [that, sort] of, [repeats] over [and] over again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, unfortunately*, "My Hero" - [while] it's nice {to} see Sega doing another *Arcade* port this game is [pretty] unplayable. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Comical Machine Gun Joe 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 April 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Next up is a Sega-[developed original title for the] Mark *III*, "Machine Gun Joe" (or "*Comical* Machine Gun Joe", as [it] is sometimes called). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Video game publishers seem {to} take a [little] break after [the] busy holiday *season*, [at] least [in] terms of their release schedule. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega [is] no *exception*; "Machine Gun Joe" came out over four [and] a half [months into] the year. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Machine* Gun Joe" is [not] a bad [*title*] - very *simple* [but an improvement] over "Seishun *Scandal*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You play this [cute little] *gangster* guy [that] everyone wants [to] kill. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just as], uh, "Seishun *Scandal*" predated games like "*Renegade*" {and} "Double *Dragon*", "*Machine* Gun Joe" [predated] "*Cabal*" by *two years*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] character moves left [and] right along the [bottom of the] *screen* shooting enemies [in] the *background*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Though, if ya *think* about [it], *this* style of game is [really just an updated] variation on "Space [Invaders]".) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Joe [can] fire [in] five directions: straight up, left, and right, as well [as] a 45 degree *angle*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] the end of every level you encounter one [of] these fast moving bosses. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's [either] this guy [in] *red* or a Japanese *schoolgirl*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya do have] a *power*-up in the form of {a} Red [Hat that] allows you [to *shoot] faster*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] *pigs* [that will drop] bombs which [can] clear [the] screen [of] *enemies*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And like] {a} couple other Sega games, "Teddy Boy Blues" and "Seishun Scandal" (the *Arcade* version), enemies [don't] *die* [but] rather [shrink] down [into] li'l versions of *themselves*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [These *little*] enemies [are not completely] *harmless*; they [can] *attach* themselves [to] your sides [and] slow ya *down*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you may [have] noticed, there [is] a [pretty] healthy dose [of] *nonsense* in "Machine Gun Joe". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess [that's] why the guy in {the} game is called "*Comical* Machine Gun Joe". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Aside from oddball enemies [like] *pigs* [and] *spiders* [the] levels have, oh, um -- [get] a [little] *weird* [as] the game *progresses*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The harbor seems like a [natural enough] place [for] gangsters [to] hang [out, but eventually ya] move on [to] this *graveyard*, [and] then to a fairy tale like [forest] setting. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "*Machine* Gun Joe" is [an] *example* of the Japanese *humor* game aesthetic. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Sort of, mixes inappropriate objects together [in weird] random ways. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Other examples would be "Twinbee" or the 'Parodius' series. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Either way, it's certainly nice [to] see Sega come up [with] something a [little] different [and] unusual for the Mark III. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ghost House 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 April 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Next up* is another Mark III *original*, the unimaginatively titled "*Ghost* House". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As ya [might] *guess* it's a [*Horror*]-themed *game* in which you traipse [your] way through a monster-filled *mansion* [with] the intent [to] find [and] kill *Dracula*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If [that] sounds like some other *better* game from *Konami*, well, the *idea* is *similar*, [but] the execution *couldn't* be more different. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Ghost House" did come [out] a few months [before] "*Castlevania*", so [it] gets points [for] being *first* [at] least but certainly not [better]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Ghost House" is, uh, more of [an] old-school Platformer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Kinda reminds me of "Mappy" or games of [*that*] ilk, but [with] some newer gaming [elements] added in. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, you [can] punch monsters as they *approach* you or you [can] kill [them] by *jumping* on *them*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have a Life Bar (not too common at this time), Health Refill items, a weapon upgrade, [*and*] a few other tricks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Despite* all this, the game does feel [decidedly] old-fashioned. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *object* is simply *to* survive *long* enough *to* [find] Dracula's *casket*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Or *rather* [to find] the *real* Dracula, as he apparently employs Dracula lookalikes as *decoys*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've killed *all* the vampires, [ya] move on [to] Stage *2* [and] *so* on. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's one [of] the caskets [right] here [and] Dracula has emerged; he's [that] rather large *bat* [floating] *around*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Any] time you *touch* a *casket*, [he'll rise out and] *attack* you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He [spends *most* of his] time *in* [bat] form [*but] occasionally*, uh, goes down [into] a human form [or] vampire form, as you see *there*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Hitting him enough] times [will] *kill* him but *usually* you take some damage *yourself* [upon] making *contact*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [at] last, I understand how *smart* Simon [*Belmont*] was to, uh, take [that] *weapon* with [him]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's various other monsters in the mansion, uh, including (well, let's see, uh) blue ghosts, lots [and] lots [of] *bats*, fire breathing trolls of some sort (um, all [of] which [are] pretty annoying and, uh, [can] be [kind] of a pain [to] *kill*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, you *do have* a, uh, rather nice (though highly unlogical) *trick* [that] you [can] use. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Jumping up [and hitting] a [*light*] bulb [will], uh -- with [your] *head* [will] cause *all* the [monsters to] *freeze* [for] a few moments. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yes, [and] there's the, uh, key you need [to] actually *open* [up the] *caskets*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here comes another *one*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *As* I mentioned, uh, [*hitting* the light] bulb [will] cause [everyone to] freeze. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] then walk up [to] the stationary Dracula [and pretty] much, uh, [*hit*] him to his heart's c... uh -- [your] heart's *content*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, hopefully *kill* him [without] taking v... -- very much *damage*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, uh, "*Ghost House*" is full [of] weird [little] nonsensical things, uh, such [as], uh, *jumping* in [front] of one [of] the *candle* holders [will] cause him [to] throw a *knife* [at] you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [But] if you *jump* [and] *land on* the knife, you [can] then use [it] as a *weapon*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just like] a *real* knife, you [can only] stab [someone with it] a few times before it simply *disappears*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes! And you [can only] use the [*light*] bulb trick a few times each level [before it] stops working. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "*[Ghost] House*" is a reasonably well *presented* game [and] *can* be fun [at] times. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Oh, as you [can] see here, the, uh, reason his [bat] form he *can* be rather difficult [to] kill, as [he] keeps *whacking* you over [and] over again.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Now, one thing* I [don't] *like* about the game is the *fact [that]*, even though you [can] *jump*, you *can't* really seem [to] jump *over* much. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *bats* move up [and] down while *flying*, [kind] of like the *Medusa* Heads [in] "*Castlevania*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 My *first* instinct is [to] try to jump over them [but] this *generally* does [not] *work* [and] ya *do* [get hit] *frequently* in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's], more [or] less, *unavoidable*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Luckily*, [your] health decreases [pretty] slowly and there're Health Refills all over. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still*, getting hit [in] this game [kind] of *pisses* me off. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I *guess* "Ghost House" [is a] halfway [point between] "*Mappy*" [and] "*Castlevania*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I never thought I'd] be *saying* [that about] a game, *but* here [it] *is*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fantasy Zone 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 June 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So* far, 1987 [hasn't] been too *impressive* [for] the Mark III [but] all [that's] about [to] *change* [with] *this* release - the fun frantic [*Cute]*-'em-Up, "*[Fantasy]* Zone". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*[Fantasy]* Zone" is a [port] of Sega's *Arcade* game, *which was* relatively *new* [at] this *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] actually [*hit*] arcades in *March*; the Mark *III* version was released in *June*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In "[Fantasy] Zone", your ship is Opa-Opa. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You must destroy a series of enemy spawning *bases* using [your] twin *laser* beams or *bombs*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *premise* is [really not that] far off from "Teddy Boy Blues". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here's* the Arcade version *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] has *fantastic presentation*, awesome music, multi-layered backgrounds, huge bosses - really everything you [could] *want* in a [Shoot]-'em-Up [of this] *era*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Mark* III version has obviously been graphically *downgraded*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [limited], uh, [vertical] scrolling found (as you [can] see *here*) in the *original* version has been eliminated. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the [first] boss [from] the Arcade version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, fantastic music. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing [about "Fantasy] Zone" [is that it] lets you *buy* [items from] *shops*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [collect] gold coins *throughout* the game [and can] then buy various upgrades [to your] engines [which will] make [you] faster. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Various sorts of weapons, more powerful bombs, *even* extra *[lives]*, which [obviously] come in [quite] handy as the [game] is, uh, [quite] *difficult*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now "[*Fantasy*] Zone" somehow [managed to get] away with breaking a [lot of] the [cardinal] rules of [*Shoot*]-'em-Ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] *example*, the *weapons* are all *temporary*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] see, my wide beam [just] ran [out] there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They [only last about] 15 *seconds*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course [*most* of them are] so powerful that they would [sort] of [break] the game if you [could] use [them until] ya die. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Odd [that], uh, "[Fantasy Zone]" came out... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Ah! Here's the 7 Way [Shot] - far [and] away the [most powerful], uh, laser in the game.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's interesting that] this game came [out right around] the same time (uh, [at least] the *Arcade* version) as "...Legend of *Zelda*" [and] both, sort of, feature the ability to buy [items in] *shops* - [sort] of an R.P.G. style idea that, uh, became increasingly popular [as] time [went] by. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *prior* [to] this game, all [of] the Mark III games had been [released] in the Sega My Card *format*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "[Fantasy] Zone" [is the] first *cartridge* [for] the system. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The carts [can] *hold* more than the My Cards; "[Fantasy Zone]" was 1 *Megabit* (uh, [pretty] impressive in those days). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Sega* would release a couple more of the My Cards after this, [*but] they were* phased [out pretty] quickly. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *As* I was mentioning, this game is [*not*] quite as impressive-looking as the Arcade version, [but *it] certainly* has the very wonderful [bright] colors of "Fantasy Zone". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing* [that] *was* changed [is] the *bosses* now all have separate screens; you [don't fight them] on the main *level*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This guy here you have to, uh, [*shoot*] the [little] three [orbiting] *planets* out through the *spaces* in the *outer* ring of planets there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [These -- All these] bosses don't *look* that difficult ([they] seem like the idea of, uh, killing 'em is [pretty] simple) *but* [the] thing is, they all have *time* limits. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If [ya don't] kill [them] *quickly* enough, they will [start] moving [around] the screen *towards* you and, uh, *kill* you actually [pretty] quickly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So, you're, sort] of, *frantically* tryin' to, uh, get these guys [as] *quickly* [as] possible. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Using power-ups [during] the boss fights *can* be helpful. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Now, one* thing about "Fantasy Zone": it] *looks* cute, but [it] *is tough*; it *can* be very tough [at] times. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Enemies [will often] materialize [out] of *nowhere*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Like *these* guys which are [incredibly] ni... [annoying]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They actually, uh, try [to] *close in on* you as [you] move left [and *right*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] they *follow* you [so] you have [to] *quickly* dash [*between* them]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I've probably lost more lives {to} those [li'l] orange things [than] any other enemy in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, enemies following you *around* [and] tryin' to *ram* [your] *ship* [are *actually* pretty] *common*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I said this game breaks a [lot] of [*Shoot*]-'em-Up *rules* [but] somehow [manages to get] *away* [with it]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Even though the game is *hard*, [it doesn't] really seem '*cheap*'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Despite*] the [fact that] enemies [will occasionally] follow [you] around, speed up, [and] then ram you [while your] *back* [is] turned. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, in conclusion, "[Fantasy] Zone" is [pretty] awesome - [*definitely*] the [best] game [of] the Mark III *so far*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] probably [the best Shoot]-'em-Up on a home [console system], so far. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Despite] many [Shoot]-'em-Ups being, uh, [released for the] *FamiCom*, uh, they were [*not*] very good ("TwinBee" meebe -- maybe being the best so far). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Definitely*] an early high [watermark] for the system. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gokuaku Doumei Dump Matsumoto 🇯🇵 // Pro Wrestling 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 July 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*1986*] is halfway *over* [and] there really [haven't] been many Mark III games *[released]* yet. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We're almost ready [to] wrap up this *episode*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *first* here's Mark III's *Wrestling Game*, "Gokuaku Doumei Dump Matsumoto" released in the U.S. under the more [generic title] of "Pro *Wrestling*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike *most* other Wrestling *Games*, "Gokuaka Doumei..." is a *female* Wrestling Game (ladies wrestling being [quite *popular* in] Japan, [at] this *time*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's also a port of] this Sega *Arcade* game called [just] "Dump *Matsumoto*" (or "*Body* Slam" in the *U.S.*) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This was ([just] like "*[Fantasy] Zone*") a *new* game! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I wonder [if] Sega [wasn't] developing, uh, *Arcade* games and their Mark III ports [in] *tandem*, [at] this point. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade version [has] a typical nice Sega System *16* graphics [and *pretty] cool music*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, you *may* be *wondering* what is 'Dump Matsumoto'? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, she's a real-life Japanese *wrestler* [and] 'Gokuaku Doumei' was her wrestling team. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I *could* be *wrong*, [but] I *think* the *Fresh* Gals were based on rival team / pop singers, the *Crush* Gals. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 While U.S. female wrestlers tend [to] be somewhat *glamorous*, in *Japan*, they often go the *opposite* route, with crazy hair [and] *makeup* giving them [an almost] *demonic* look. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, this Mark *III* version has *taken* a [*pretty*] big [graphical] *hit*, as [well as] a stylistic *makeover*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The more [realistically proportioned] *figures* are now [your], uh, *typical* super-deformed style characters. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] wrestler [can] throw punches [and] *kicks* [and has] a few special moves, performed while the opponent is either *down* or flying off the ropes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There *is* no *grappling* in this *game* - something [that] would become *standard* in [most] Wrestling Games *later* such as Nintendo's "*Pro* Wrestling" (which was released [about] three months after *this*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still*, "Gokuaku Doumei..." *is [pretty] advanced* for its *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Consider [that its predecessors] on *consoles* were the really, really super awful, uh, '*Kinnikuman*' [and] Technos' "Tag Team *Wrestling*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] *even* occasionally find a *chair* [to] use [as] a *weapon*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *in* the [United] States, uh, this game was [released] under the name "*Pro* Wrestling" with the *wrestlers* being changed to more generic-style male wrestlers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess really scary-looking female wrestlers [wouldn't] fly with Western *gamers* or [just *really* wouldn't] make any sense [to] them - them having nothing [to connect it] with. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This nice [li'l] *intro* has been *added* of the wrestlers jumping [into] the ring, [*but* the] game [itself *pretty] much* plays the same. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Either way*, this game *can* be *difficult* [and] a [little] *unfair*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 First of all, ya have [to] play a [*lot*] of [*rounds* to] win the *championship*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*And*] the C.P.U. [almost] seems [to always] have the upper hand. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your punches [and] kicks [often] *miss* [while] the C.P.U. seems [to] be able [to get] a [lot] more *hits* in. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Their special [moves can also] be [performed] *much* more *quickly*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [while] this is [an] interesting, uh, entry from *Sega*, I -- I [*wouldn't*] really consider [it] {to} be a classic and there [certainly would] be [*better*] Wrestling Games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hokuto no Ken 🇯🇵 // Black Belt 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 July 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Whoa-ho! [That's] a rather [dramatic little] intro *there*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Our] last game [in] the first episode of 'Chronsega' *is* "[Hokuto no] *Ken*", which was based on the popular comic, T.V. series, movie, [et] cetera known as "Fist [of] the *North* Star" in the *West*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*plotline*] is somewhat complicated. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] involves *this* guy, *Kenshiro*, who [lives in] a post-apocalyptic world - [and can hit] guys so hard they *explode*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *How*? By [hitting them] on their *pressure points*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Japan*] was [apparently] in the midst of a '[Hokuto no] Ken' *blitz* because [about] two weeks [later] *this game* came out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "[Hokuto no] Ken" by Shouei System for [the] *FamiCom* - one of the all-time *worst* FamiCom *games*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Normally* the name "[Hokuto no] *Ken*" strikes [terror in] the hearts of sensitive video gamers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*But*] the *Sega* game *really* [isn't that] *bad* by *comparison*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course being [better than] the *FamiCom* "[Hokuto] no Ken" is [sort of like] being taller [than] a *midget*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] *really* [not] *saying* much. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is [your] standard early [*Beat*]-'em-*Up*: 'walk right [and] *kill* guys' ([not] really that much [different than] "Kung-*Fu* Master"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [have] a *punch*, a *kick*, a *leg sweep*, a *low punch*, *and* (if you kick while *jumping*) a flying *kick*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Every so [often] ya face a *sub*-boss - and [at the] end of each level a *main* boss. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 All this adds up to a game [that] is *decent* (if *repetitive*) [but] there [at least] some variation in the boss *fights*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If nothing else, Sega *could* [create] a [decent] *boss* [fight], as proven by earlier games, like "[*Fantasy*] Zone", *which* had really rad *bosses*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Compared [to] the FamiCom game, these guys [don't] explode quite as *entertainingly*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They [just, sort] of, fly [into] various pieces. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alright], here's the [first] *boss*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Apparently*] all this follows [the plot] of [a *comic*] book. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *In* a nice touch, the boss fights [take] place [in] their own [little] *areas* [and] they actually have bigger [*sprites*]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sort of like Konami's soon-to-be-released "*Castlevania*", each boss has a *pattern*, [and] you *[must] find* his weakness [and] *exploit* it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Simply ...tt... -- attacking [mindlessly won't] work. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Once* you drain a boss Life Bar, you then proceed [to] whip the [*shit* out] of *them*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] he *[doesn't] explode* [for] some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Then it's on [to] the *next level* with, uh, [*slightly*] more [difficult] enemies and *so* on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And here we *go*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These guys *jump* occasionally, as [opposed to just] walking *forward*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, *doesn't* '[Hokuto no] Ken' [take] place [in] *Japan*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 What's [with] all the Old West style *saloon* doors [in] the *buildings*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *[in] the U.S.* where "Fist [of the North Star]" wasn't [really] very [*popular* yet], Sega pulled a *Bandai* [and released] the game s... -- sans-[licensed] characters as "Black Belt". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *gameplay* [is] the same, [but] the [*sprites* and backgrounds have] all been *changed [to] more* generic Kung-Fu dudes [and], uh, Chinese [*settings*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] of course, the high [quality] of the somewhat ridiculous [*artwork*] on the *Japanese* version *has been* [replaced] by one of *the* [most] notorious examples of bad video game *cover* art. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You're wondering why the Master [System didn't] sell over here? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well, *seriously*], looking [at that] cover [art], would you *buy the game*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One *change* [is] now there [are little sort] of *power*-ups [or] *Health* Refills [that float] by [occasionally]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have [to execute] a special jump to [*get*] them [and it] seems like they always appear when [you're] *surrounded* by *enemies*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *bosses* [have] all been changed from '[Hokuto no] Ken' *characters* to the, uh, more generic [karate] dudes, *[but] they* [mostly] behave the same. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As [you'll] see on the *[first] boss* they, sort of, changed [his] *hairstyle*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "[Hokuto no] Ken" - a decent Arcade-style *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But], *Sega*, this is *1986*; games [are] *changing*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You need [to get with] the *times*! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 1 Wrap Up ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, there ya *have [it]*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That] was the first 10 [months] of the Mark *III*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] th... -- Sega's system was a [technically] impressive *console, software*-wise [it] was still [in its] *infancy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Mark* III was [not particularly successful] *in* Japan where, by late 1985, the FamiCom [*dominated*] the *market*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *What* Sega *lacked* was (in *modern* terms) a 'killer app'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo [certainly] *had* this [with "Super] *Mario Bros.*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega was (ironically) the more [experienced] video game [*producer*], but yet *hadn't* been able [to] make a really *good* console *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [To] see how [different and] innovative the FamiCom *was*, think of the original *games* released during this same *time* period. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "[Super] *Mario Bros.*", "*Portopia*...", "...Legend of *Zelda*", "Mighty *Bomb Jack*", "Dragon *Quest*" - not [to] mention the many *ports* of such games as "Makaimura" and "*Gradius*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Additionally, Sega* had a rather relaxed [release] *schedule*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Six games* in the [first] *seven months* of *1986*, as opposed [to almost] *40 games* [for the] *FamiCom*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 No wonder o... -- no one [bought] the Mark III! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Sega* had [quite] a ways [to] go before [it could] catch up to *Nintendo*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Hopefully* [we'll] see [some *improvement*] in "Chronsega Episode 2". 🍇🍌
