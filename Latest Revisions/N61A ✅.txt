👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 61 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey, *folks*, Dr. Sparkle *here*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And [for] *this* intro, I'm just gonna completely ad-lib it, just sorta *straight off* the dome. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As [you] guys are, of course, all *aware*, it's been a long time since the last episode, *which* was, of course, a very long and *tiring* episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *But*, um, *I'd* [gotten] partially done with "...Episode <Sixty-*One*::*61*>", [and] then, of course, I had a *rather* large break. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... I did, of course, mention this a little bit on my Twitter account, but I *had*, uh, what was *assumed* to be, uh, a heart attack by myself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... Turns out it *wasn't* and, quite frankly, the doctors have put -- done -- *run me* through a number of tests and that kind of thing, and *can't* quite figure out what the, uh -- the issue is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *But, um*, it's just one of those things where, I guess, y... -- ya know when you're -- you're -- you're getting old. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... I felt perfectly fine one day, and then the day after this happened I felt like I've literally aged *<twenty::20>* years. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, gone from being [I] feel -- [I] -- I feel like a normal person to someone who is exhausted *all* the time, and *quite frankly* can barely -- *barely* function as a human being, sometimes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... *Also*, I've had (I guess, just because of having a job that involves working at a computer) -- *finally* getting hit with some serious problems with my right *hand*, which is what I use [to] do all the *editing* and, of course, typing [and] that sort of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... *Going forward*, I'm *trying* to be using more things like, um, voice-to-t... uh, voice-[to]-text recognition programs [to] sort of write the *scripts*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... At this point, at least, um, sort of typing everything up is not really gonna be a possibility, um, until I figure [and] -- until, ya know, whatever is the problem in -- with my hand gets better. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... *So anyway*, yeah, like I said, I mean, yeah, I went basically as *many months* as possible without using my right hand at *all*, and it's *definitely* feeling a little bit better, at this point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... [I] think I'll [probably] need some more work on it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But *once* I got [to] the point where I feel that I actually had the *ability* to actually edit the videos [and] that kind of thing, I finally put everything together, and *here* we are. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So *'nother* -- 'nother, uh, <ten::10> games here, *including one* which was *supposed [to] be* a few episodes ago, um, but got *delayed*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is [*probably*] not gonna be anyone's favorite *'Chrontendo' episode (unless* you actually like all the horrible bad games that I hafta play on this) because it's *mostly* a bunch [of] junk this time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This, of course, is the first episode since the last one, which *I declared*, kind of, like, the pinnacle of the FamiCom/N.E.S. *lifespan*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And we're now reaching, sort of, the [part] where everything *kind of* starts taking a, uh -- a downward slide so to speak. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Anyway*, we have another exciting <ten::10> games for ya, so, uh, let's get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Castle Quest 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 May 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Hudson*, you did me *dirty* with *this* game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "*Castle* Quest", this game looks *cool* and maybe it's just *me* but I got absolutely *nowhere* with this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Playing* this thing just had me banging my head against the *wall*, which is a *shame* since I *thought* it *looked [pretty] cool*! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There is an English translation *available*, which is *helpful* since some of the writing is actually [pretty] *funny*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game feels like, 'What if "Fire Emblem" was played on a *chessboard*?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there're *two* sides. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When playing in <One::1>-Player mode, you are at the bottom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *object* is [to] kill the other side's *king*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Doing so* will allow you to move on [to] the next *level*, of *which* there are a *total* of <twenty-five::25>. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *those among you* with good memories (and I do not count myself in that category) -- ya *might* be thinking, '*Wait* a sec! Didn't we already *have* a game called "Castlequest", like, *years* ago?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That is *correct*! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I covered it in "Episode <Number...::#{12}>". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Note to self: Look up episode number and edit it in here; do [not] forget.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was [*released*] by *ASCII* in <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Six*::*1986*> as "Castle *Excellent*" (ironically) in *Japan* [and] "<*Castle*-Quest::*Castlequest*>" in the *U.S.*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was a mostly forgettable Puzzle-ish *Exploration Game*, set in a *castle*, obviously. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, of course, this game had *nothing* [at] all [to] do with [today's] "Castle Quest". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Each side* takes *turns* moving one piece per *turn*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Different types of *units* move differently [and] have different *abilities*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's *[kinda like] chess*, I guess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some [of] the fighters (such as the trolls, for example) are *physical* fighters, whereas the *wizard*-looking guys will pepper the opponent's side with magical *attacks*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *However*, once the battle *begins*, it gets a little *weird*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You *fight* by drawing *cards*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, I'm *kind of* getting some bad memories of "<~Avoid the~::{Yo!}> Noid", here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the *higher* card you draw, the more damage you *do - or* the higher [your] *defense* will be, if [you're] being *attacked*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *FamiCom version* is [somewhat] *obscure, but* in <Nineteen-Ninety-*Three*::1993> it was *released* in the *U.S.* for [the] *Game* Boy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, granted this version is *incredibly ugly* and a [bit different from the] *console* version, but that was the [only] way to *play* "Castle Quest" at the *time*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *translated* FamiCom version is *definitely* the way [to] go. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's *colorful*; the goofy *art style is fun*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, just *look* [at] these guys. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 From a *purely* aesthetic *standpoint* I *love it*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I just fail *horribly* when it comes to playing the game *itself*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I can't stand the -- the whole, [sort of], card-shuffling element. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I mean], it always seems like the computer gets better cards than I do. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's a lot of other elements here as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, there's a night and *day cycle* which will heal wounded units at *dawn*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every time you *lose* a *unit* a gravestone will *appear* at the bottom of the *screen* and that can eventually result in you losing an entire row of *territory*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So I *guess* final judgment is: a very well-made game which I just, uh, *completely* bounced off *really* hard. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished: The Final Chapter 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 May 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Falcom | Advance Communication 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Falcom 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, here we go, "<Ease-Two::Ys II>"! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the *box* art, for some reason, just says *literally* "<Ease-Two::Ys II>"; it lacks the *subtitle*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though on the actual *title* screen, in the game *itself*, it shows as "<Ease-Two::Ys II>: Ancient <Ease::Ys> Vanished: The Final *Chapter*". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There is an unofficial English *translation* for this, so we'll load this up *here*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, we're not gonna go too deep into this game, *simply* because after this *episode* we'll be seeing the *definitive* version of this in 'Chronturbo'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Nothing wrong* exactly with the FamiCom "<Ease-Two::Ys II>", but... no one thinks of the *FamiCom* when they think of the first two '*<Ease::Ys>*' games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Just* to compare, here's the FamiCom version of "<Ease-One::Ys (I)>" and it *looks* very *similar*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Many of the sprites are *exactly* the same as in the first *game*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the *houses*, for example, are almost *identical*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So there were *no* obvious graphical upgrades despite there being an approximately two-year gap between the two games' releases. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so ya start off in a little village. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (*Wow*! What a *shocker*.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I *guess* ya fell outta the *tower* in "<Ease-One::Ys (I)>" and landed *here*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Ya] need to walk around, talk [to] people, ... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Some guy's gone *missing*', 'there's something in the *basement*', yada, yada, yada. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A *kind soul* gives you *<three-hundred::300>* gold *pieces, which* allows you [to] buy some armor [and] a *sword*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *And then* you can enter the ruins and caves and stuff to kill dudes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *game itself* was about *two* years *old* when the FamiCom version was *released*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It first] came [out for] various Japanese [*computer* platforms in] <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Eight*::*1988*>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Here's* the *<M.X.Two::M.{S}.X.2>* version which, of course, is *loaded down* with various borders and whatnot *and it has* some [pretty] wonky scrolling. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For *non*-'<Ease::Ys>'-fans, let me explain this game's *gimmick*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You *fight monsters* by running *into* them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Doing so causes, like, a little *collision* and *pushes* you back a *smidge* but takes off some health from the monster. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *So [you] just* keep walking into monsters over and *over* again until finally they die, *but* they can also attack *you*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If a monster runs into *you* then *you* get damage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *So* it's best to sort of send yourself flying towards *monsters*, bounce off *them a couple times*, and then they'll die. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *whether or not* you can tolerate this weird *battle* mechanic *will determine* how much you like these games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And *be aware* there is a lot of grinding in this game, *especially here* at the very *beginning*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, *Regs* says he needs that box that the demons are *guarding*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *However*, you can't *damage* the demons until you reach Level *<Three::3>*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In order to get to Level *<Two::2>*, you need <a hundred::100> *eXperience* Points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And to get to Level <Three::3>, you must have <*Three*-Hundred::*300*> eXperience Points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, *so far*, I have *<twelve::12>*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most monsters in *this area* give *one or two* eXperience Points when you *kill* them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you *can find* a nearby *cave* with tougher *monsters* that give more *X.P.*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But [it is] *also* filled with a number of monsters that're too strong for you to *kill*, at this point. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *The '<Ease::Ys>' series* was *reasonably* popular in *Japan and* spawned numerous sequels and *remakes, as* you're probably aware. 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 "That's why we must talk..." 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A few years later (in <Nineteen-Ninety-*Two*::*1992*>, as a [matter of *fact*]) they released an *anime* version called "*<Ease-Two::Ys II>*: Castle in the *Heavens*". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it *looks* just as bad as you can imagine it *would* be. 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 "I'm coming!" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *In terms of* other *versions* of this game (aside from the well-known TurboGrafx *CD version) there* is a Sega *Saturn* remake released on, uh, the "*Falcom Classics*" disc in <Nineteen-[Ninety]-*Eight*::*1998*>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Naturally*, we get animated *cutscenes and* a big helping of anime stirred into the *pot*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Overall though the *Saturn version* is *[pretty] appealing* - nice <sixteen::16>-bit style *sprites and a* [pretty] good arrangement of the *music*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I *don't believe* this has ever received an English *translation*, though there *is* currently a *fan translation* of the Saturn version of "<Ease-One::Ys (*I*)>" which is *currently* in the works. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *In <Two-Thousand-Eight::2008>* a remake of "<Ease-One::Ys (I)>" and "...*<Two::II>" appeared* for the Nintendo *D.S.*, which sounds *promising* but, *eh*, it's not so great. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *There's* extra cutscenes and such but the *music* is *corny* as hell and *everything* looks *really ugly*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Look at this awful *walking animation* here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The whole thing just *totally* lacks the *charm* of the *original* "<Ease-One::Ys (I)>" and "...*<Two::II>*". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Anyway, once* ya kill the monsters and get the *staff*, you'll need to then explore the *caves* and, you know, talk to statues like you often do in '<Ease::Ys>' games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's *really* nothing *wrong with this game*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just completely *overshadowed* by a much *better version* that came out around the same *time, which* we will be covering soon. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Baken Hisshou Gaku: Gate In 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 May 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Graphic Research 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by KAC 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Oh, boy*! Another *Horse Racing* Game, "Baken Hisshou Gaku: Gate In". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The name translates *roughly* to "Horse Betting Certain Victory School: Gate In". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Published by KAC (K-A-C) whom we last encountered with "Ikari *<Three::III>*" and *developed* by Graphical *Research*, who is known for... *well*, nothing that you'll remember. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *previous* Horse Racing Games that we've seen have *all* had some kind of *hook* like a celebrity *endorsement or something but* there's *no* such luck here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, *this* is *one of the most* stripped-down Simulation Games I've seen, so *far*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is *virtually* a text-*[only]* game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *These menus* take you through an *excessive* number of options and *choices*, with regards to *training*, different types of *tracks*, *diet*, and *so* on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just *pages* and *pages* which allow you to customize every aspect of the horse and their *training*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alrighty, so *once* everything is set up you can finally *experience* the *thrill* of horse racing, the *Sport* of *Kings*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Here* we go. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, well that's sort of anti-climactic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's *not even* any *music*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, *I don't* really know why we've had, like, a *total glut* of Horse Racing Games *recently*, but I *don't think* there's any coming up in the near *future, so* we will have a brief respite from this particular genre. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jajamaru Gekimaden: Maboroshi no Kinmajou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 May 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The last Japanese game for *May, "Jajamaru* Gekimaden...", a *little-remembered game, starring* Jaleco's unloved *mascot*, Ninja Jajamaru. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Released* in Japan *[only]*, we are <lucky QUOTE-UNQUOTE::"*lucky"> to have an unofficial* English *translation*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Okay*, so the *great demon* is *awake*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sounds like bad *news*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Monsters roaming the *land*? Check. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ancient evil threatening the *Earth*? Check. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Only] *you* can defeat the evil *forces*? Check, check, check. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For some reason, the Ninja Village can't just send a whole army of *ninjas. Nope*! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it's *just* you, a one-man army. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a few small *houses in this village*, and a shop, and an *inn*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Nothing* really too exciting, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, in terms of "...Zelda" clones, *this* certainly isn't up to "*Crystalis*" when [it] comes to *ambition*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya see this world *map*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is *literally* one-third of the entire overworld. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The entire overworld map consists of *three* maps this size - one to the north (beyond [that] cloud [that] you see) and then one to the east. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each map has a few *caves* or *towers*, but the world is *surprisingly compact* for a <Nineteen-[Ninety]::1990> game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Now, this* is, of course, not the first 'Ninja Jajamaru' game we've *seen*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, this is either the *fourth* or the *fifth* game in the *series*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Ninja Jajamaru-kun" *hit* the shelves in <Nineteen-Eighty-Six::1986>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a simple little Arcade-style game where you were trying to rescue a princess and must face off against hordes of *supernatural* beings. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's *something* like a pseudo-sequel [to] U.P.L.'s "Ninja-Kid", which *some people* consider [to] be actually the first game in the *series*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 None of these games were especially *memorable*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If I put a gun to your head and asked you [to] describe the [previous] four 'Jajamaru' games, <ninety-nine [percent]::99%> of you would end up dead. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even I can't remember anything about them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Right, so there's really not much [to] do here except, uh, go down [to] the nearest dungeon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, it's right around the *corner*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Much like* "...Zelda"'s dungeons, ya move through a series of rectangular *rooms* filled with respawning *monsters*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *this isn't* an R.P.G.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya don't get any eXperience Points for killing *enemies*, though sometimes they do drop *money*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *However*, in *most cases*, you can just sort of *avoid* them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Each floor is [pretty] small and there's *about* five floors in this castle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some rooms are filled with *enemies* and others just have... nothing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Sometimes* the stairway is hidden by a *rock*, in the most obvious fashion possible. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *once* you get [to] the *top*, you'll encounter this guy who gives you the Key of *Innocence, which* despite the fancy name, is just a key that unlocks the next *dungeon*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Luckily*, the next *dungeon* is right *here*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's directly above the castle where we got the key. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's no lights, so it's pitch black. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Compared* to "...*Zelda*", the enemies are just... *annoying* (the way they move around in weird patterns). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] *just look* [at] these things! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Are they maggots? Caterpillars? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why [do] they just fly around the screen so *fast*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, *why* are *caterpillars* this *fast*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It doesn't make any *sense*! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, [and], *by* the way, we were supposed to use the *oil* lamp in order [to] light the *room*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *My* bad. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Combat with the bosses is very much in the "...Zelda" style. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When ya *finally* deliver the killing *blow*, the entire room *instantly* lights with explosions everywhere. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, the second your *yo-yo touches him*, he just disappears, rather than, like, *freezing* and flashing or, like, fading out, *like* a lot of N.E.S. bosses do. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Also*, you get an item that grants you a new *power* - the *ability* to burrow *underground*, so you could move around without getting hit by *enemies*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya then travel to *another area*, [and] go into another very boring *dungeon with* more very annoying *enemies*, [and] so on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing about the enemies is [that] they drop money but they do so in a very stingy fashion. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Most [of] the time* they don't drop *anything*, [and] when they *do* it's usually just one coin. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So buying *support items* is a *pain* because you have [to] grind for *coins*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned, the game world is quite *small*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But *complaining* about a bad game being too *short* is a little *weird*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's like the old joke about the *restaurant* where the food is *terrible* and the portions are too small. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, *next up*, we're gonna see some *Western* games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Snake's Revenge 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 April [?] 🇺🇸 // 1992 March 26 🇬🇧 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Ultra 🇺🇸 // Konami 🇬🇧 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Okay*, we now *have* everyone's *least favorite* 'Metal *Gear' game*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm speaking, of course, *of* "Snake's *Revenge*". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was actually released sometime in *April*, but I was really not in a big hurry [to] actually *play this thing*, so I ended up pushing it out [to] June. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No big deal, I suppose. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *this is famous* for being Konami's 'Metal *Gear' game* which was [not] designed by *Kojima*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In *fact, they didn't* even use the *name* 'Metal Gear' in the *title*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *complete name is simply* "Snake's *Revenge*". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the *game* definitely has some fans and I am [absolutely not] *one of* them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, I'd say the opening *sequence* here is *one of the* worst introductory *levels* that I've ever *played* in a game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They drop you down in a jungle (which, ya know, sure that makes sense, I suppose) but then you get *immediately attacked* by these little dudes in mini *helicopter* things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, (being a 'Metal *Gear' game*) this is a *Stealth* Game, so if these guys *see you*, suddenly a million guys will rush out [and] start *shooting* [at] you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And what *bugs* me, here is *really* the game just, sort of, puts you down [into] this and gives you *no* hints as {to how} [to] deal with this section. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, what's going on here is you have to avoid getting into those helicopter look -- guys' lines of *sight*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And *they do*, sort of, fly around in certain *patterns*, but *this is actually* surprisingly *difficult*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And *you'd think* the game would, kind of, like, slowly ease you *in*, into this particular style of *stealth mechanic*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But *no*! It's *merciless*! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And *if you take one step* in the wrong direction, literally <ten::10> seconds [into] the game, you're gonna get *killed*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Now, eventually*, of course, with some practice you can figure this *out*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, [*to] me*, this [just] seems like a *totally* bizarre way [to] start the very first level of this *game* before you really are used to the *mechanics*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, like *any* 'Metal Gear' game, you have a little radio thing (or *transceiver*, as they call it). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you'll talk [to] other guys [and] they'll give you *hints* [and that] kinda thing and just sorta tell ya what your mission is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This *second* section is not nearly as bad as the *first*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] mean, at *least* here you can see which way the *lights are moving* and figure out how to *avoid them*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, *along the way*, you'll find all kinds of various weapons, items, *key cards*, health refills, and that sort of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There is, of course, a great deal of <QUOTE-UNQUOTE gear::"gear"> in a 'Metal *Gear*' game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Now, ya might* be familiar with the *story* behind the development of this *game*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *first* N.E.S. "Metal Gear" game *was* a *reasonable* hit in the U.S. (*and Europe*) but kind of sank (like a turd) in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Konami decided* to come up with a *sequel* (released in the U.S. and Europe) but Kojima himself was *actually* not part of the *design* team. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Thus*, while this game is technically an official 'Metal *Gear' game*, it's not really part of the <QUOTE-UNQUOTE 'Metal Gear' *canon*::"'Metal Gear' *canon*">. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is like an alternate *universe* 'Metal Gear' [or] something like that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *the other thing* is that there was, *of course*, a *Kojima*-designed "Metal Gear *<Two::2>*" game for the *M.S.X.<Two::2>*, which *came out around* the same time and is *generally* considered [to] be a much *better*-looking *game* and which also has [pretty] cool *music*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The, uh, *<~M.X.S.~::[M.S.X.]>* "Metal Gear <Two::2>" never came out in the *U.S., of course*, but there is an English *translation* so you can play this thing on a <~M.X.Two~::M.{S}.X.2> emulator if you like. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Okay*, so goin' back to the *inferior* game that we're discussing *today*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Once* you enter the actual building, it feels a little bit more like the first game where ya have these guards who walk around in repetitive *patterns*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *And* you just need to make sure that they don't *look* [at] you while they're walking around the *hallways*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If they *do* just happen [to] see you, you [can] silence them by using a silent weapon, such as the *knife*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The cost of actually getting *spotted* in this game is *relatively high*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If one guy *sees you*, they'll alert everyone *else* and suddenly a whole bunch [of] guys will come pouring in through all the doors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, this isn't really a *Combat Game*; it's a *Stealth Game*, so you're supposed to avoid this kinda thing *happening*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The whole idea here is [to] sort of *avoid* being seen and *avoid* combat. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *game structure* is *basically* just, sort of, walking around through one area until ya find the *boss at the end*, and then exit the *level* and go on to the next area. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *And, of course*, there's a whole *buttload* of various *items* and pieces of *gear [that] you can pick up* (like the various types of weapons, machine guns, health refills, *scuba gear* - you know, that kinda stuff). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike the *first* game (at least, as far as *I* can remember) there are some actual *side-scrolling* sections in this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's a few things like elevators [and] so on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Once* you reach the first *boss* room which is -- a boss here is basically just a bunch [of] guys who I *think {are} actually* robots or androids or something, and they essentially just bum rush you until ya die. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In order to get your way out of this, you hafta throw *grenades at these guys*, and you have some *bombs that you can use*, and once you run out of those you can just use your machine gun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *And then*, of course, you just move on to the next *level*, which (*in this case*) just happens to be a ship. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *As I mentioned, earlier*, there are *fans who like this*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think most people kind of consider this [to] be, sort of, like, the forgotten 'Metal Gear' game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It certainly doesn't really *play* like the first one *that* much. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, quite frankly, this game being *removed* from the official 'Metal Gear' *canon* is *really* no loss whatsoever. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Remote Control 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 May [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by RSP 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hi Tech Expressions 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We have a total of *one* (yes, *one*) Western game [in] May <Nineteen-[Ninety]::1990> and, [*unfortunately*, that] game *is* M.T.V's "Remote *Control*", released by Hi Tech *Expressions* and developed by *R.S.P.*, the guys who would *eventually* form Running With *Scissors*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you're wondering what's going on here, that's supposed to be *popcorn* flying around. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, it seems like we've had a lotta *Game Show* titles recently and, uh, there'll be more in June [and] *July*, so mentally *prepare* yourself. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Geez*! Why does my character look kinda like Elon *Musk*? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "*Remote* Control" was a game show that *ran on* M.T.V. from <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Seven*::*1987>* [to] <Nineteen-[*Ninety*]::*1990*>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And *[it] was actually* the first non-music-based *program* on *M.T.V.*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So if you are pissed that Music T.V. does not play any *music videos anymore*, I guess you could say it all sorta started *here*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *concept* behind the game is that the *host*, Ken *Ober*, was obsessed with T.V. as a *child*, to the extent that he led a life of *celibacy*, according to [the] *theme* song. 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 "...*Girls* said '*Yes*!', but he said, '*No*! Remote Control!'..." 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 He now has his own *game* show, which appears [to] be filmed in his *basement*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Three contestants* are strapped [into] *La-Z-Boys* and answer various *questions, mostly* pertaining to T.V. shows and other bits of pop *culture*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Among *other* [things], they get popcorn and food *dumped on them*, and there are *musical* and comedic bits performed by Colin *Quinn* and sometimes Adam *Sandler*, *both of who* would go on to S.N.L. after this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sometimes special guests would appear on the show, such as the *Red Hot Chili Peppers*(?). 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 "...Let's meet 'em! First of all, right here in the turquoise chair, Flea and Anthony, joined at the *spleen*!" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I *assume* they weren't able [to] use Ober's *likeness for this*, since the host in this game neither looks nor *acts* like *Ober*, and his *responses* are much more *sarcastic* than Ober's. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Don't get me wrong; *Ober* is [pretty] *nice*, but he... *can* occasionally be a little sarcastic. 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 "According to his *theme* song, who's the black private dick that's a sex machine for all the chicks? 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 Jon?" 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 "Dick Tracy, Ken?" 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 "[Chuckles] Hardly! Hardly, Jon!" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Each contestant* picks one of several *channels*, each of which has a certain *theme, often* very *specific* (like a *'Brady Bunch'* channel). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When the question is asked, the *first person* to hit the buzzer gets [to] *answer*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *One thing* I found a little weird at first is that you *use* the *A button* to *ring* the buzzer and then the *B button* to choose your *answer*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, why not use the same *button*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Probably because*, by default, the cursor is pointed to the *top answer*, so if you get too excited and [accidentally] hit A *twice* then you would have unintentionally selected [that] answer. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Much like* the "Double Dare" game, [a] *lotta* the questions might be hard to answer, since they require knowledge of pop *culture* from the [<Seventies::'70s> and <Eighties::'80s>] (*a lot of which* has been forgotten [in <[Twenty-Twenty]-Two::*2022*>]). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I certainly cannot remember [the] name of the *high* school from 'Welcome Back, *Kotter*'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Can *you*? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yeah, [and] here's the part where ya get the popcorn thrown at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 "...let's check the *scoring*! 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 In the *lead*, it's Jennifer with <sixty-five::65>! 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 Jon's got [*<forty::40>*]! 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 Brian has got [*<thirty::30>*]! 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 We're serving up the *makings* for..." 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I got off to a bad start, but *eventually* became determined to just *totally* annihilate these geeks, *which* I did. 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 "*Oh! Brian*! By *<five::5> little tiny dinky inky points*, you're *gone*!" 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *contestants* that're *eliminated* get sucked [into] the wall, in the *T.V. version*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But *here* they just get... *murdered*(?), I guess? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *So, aside* from the eye-searingly ugly *color scheme* and the repetitive *music*, this is not *awful, per se*; it's just sort of *dated*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's *weird* that this was released so close [to] "Double *Dare*", which had a *very* similar format. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Alright*! We now go on to *June* of <Nineteen-[Ninety]::1990>. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Chip to Dale no Daisakusen 🇯🇵 // Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 June 08 🇯🇵 // 1990 June 09 🇺🇸 // 1991 December 12 🇬🇧 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We've *made* it, *guys*, June <Nineteen-[*Ninety*]::1990>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just a *warning*, though, there's gonna be a lot of U.S. releases from guys like *Mindscape*, *GameTek*, and *Parker* Brothers in June. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *For* the *moment*, though, we have a relatively well-liked *game* from *Capcom*, based on the Disney animated *T.V.* show, which ran from <Nineteen-[Eighty]-Nine::1989> [to] <Nineteen-[*Ninety*]::*1990*>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The show's *concept* was [to] take Chip [and] Dale (*two* annoying chipmunks *who served as* a *foil* for Donald Duck in a *series* of *shorts* in the early <Nineteen-*Fifties*::*1950s*>)... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [*Presumably*], due to [the success] of '*DuckTales*', the *characters* were reworked into private *detectives* who go on a [lot] of *adventures* [and] such. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *simplest* way to *describe* this game *is* it's basically just 'Mega Man' for younger *kids*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You navigate a series of *levels* which use both horizontal and vertical *travel, with* various sorts of pitfalls [and] traps, *including* 'Mega Man'-style disappearing *platforms* [and] such. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game's main conceit is *boxes* - specifically picking up wooden *boxes* [and] *throwing* them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 <~*Ducksburg*~::[*Duckburg*]> (or wherever this is) is *full* of boxes - boxes on the *ground*, boxes in *trees, tons* of boxes inside every single *building*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are *literally* hundreds of boxes *everywhere* in this *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Various characters *[from the] T.V.* show make cameo appearances, like this *bug* dude, *Zipper*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya know, there was *apparently* a "Chip 'n Dale..." *movie* out, *recently*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I guess *Zipper* and *Gadget* are *married* and have a *child*, thus *forcing* you to contemplate the idea of a fly screwing a *rat (absolutely revolting*!). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Oh* yeah, [and] *this guy*, Monterey *Jack*, makes these cameo appearances for absolutely no reason. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Okay, here's* the first boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {I've} *no idea* what he's supposed to be, but every boss is *kinda* the same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They attack you from *above* and you throw a *ball* at them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The clever idea is that the ball bounces around *after* ya *throw* it, and will *damage* you if it *hits* you while *bouncing*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you have to avoid both the enemy's *projectiles* and your own *weapon*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Between levels you get messages from *Gadget*, the sexy *rodent* that turned a bunch of kids into *furries*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Even today* all kinds of *weirdos* are *horny* for Gadget. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Just* check out *deviantART* [if] ya don't *believe* me. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Interestingly, Gadget* was based on a character from "*Real Genius*", the <Nineteen-Eighty-Five::1985> Val *Kilmer* movie. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Anyway*, what we've seen, so far, *is* basically the entire game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enter a new *level*, walk from left [to] *right*, then fight a boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *layout* of the levels *isn't* completely *linear*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you [can] see, there are *two* forking *paths*, so there *are* a couple levels that you *can* entirely skip. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *These* guys are *freaky*; they shoot green goo out of their *crotches*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The blast is so powerful that it knocks them *backwards*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, ya know, there's *plenty* [of] cute stuff in here, like jumping on these faucet handles [to] turn the water off - or having to avoid falling into pots of boiling *water*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What a *horrible* way [to] die! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's *nothing* wrong with "...Rescue *Rangers*"; it's just, uh, the whole game is kinda *samey*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Compared [to] "DuckTales", the environments just seem all sort of *similar*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [<ninety-percent::90%>] walking left [to] right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a little bit of vertical movement, here [and] there, but there's *not* a whole lot of variation [in] this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game does switch it up a *little* bit with this boss (a giant *tank*-like *thing*). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *And* we get a little bit of 'Mega Man'-like platforming in *this* section. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The <QUOTE-UNQUOTE final boss::"final boss"> is this *cat* throwing *money* at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There're spikes along the ground, which you must *avoid*, but which *also* have some rather unfair *hit* detection. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After defeating this guy you've *won. Hooray*! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 To *celebrate*, you throw a big bouquet of flowers in Gadget's *face, but* no, Fat Cat has escaped. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you *chase* him in a *rocket* and land on an *island* with three additional *levels*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a reasonably tough *boss* here - a *caterpillar* whose segments go flying [and] rain down on you in a rather unpredictable *fashion*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, *boy*! Here's everyone's *favorite*, the conveyor belt *level*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At *least* there is a generous supply of *acorns*, which refill one unit of *health*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *final boss* is *Fat Cat*, the T.V. series' main bad guy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *[As] far [as]* boss fights go, this is [pretty] unspectacular. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just avoid the *cigar* ashes he flicks [at] you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then ya get a bit of closing exposition. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "*Chip 'n Dale*..." isn't really a *bad game*, but its appeal [today] is [<ninety-percent::90%>] nostalgia value. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you didn't play this as a *kid*, you [*probably*] won't get much out of it, *especially* in the <One::1>-Player mode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *<Two::2>-Player* was *really* the way to go for "Chip 'n Dale...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the words of today's *young folks*, this game is basically kind of *mid*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It lacks the flair of *"DuckTales" or* "Darkwing Duck". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Alright, let's move on* to a much more obscure game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dash Yarou 🇯🇵 // {Rally Bike 🇺🇸} ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 June 15 🇯🇵 // 1990 September [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Toaplan | Visco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Visco 🇯🇵 // {Romstar 🇺🇸} 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Hey kids*! [Do] you like absolutely worthless *ports* of good *Arcade games*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then, *guess what*, we've got a game [for] *you*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Dash Yarou" (or "Dash *Rascal*", in *English*) is a *terrible* little motorcycle *Racing* Game, released in Japan by *Visco*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *controls on this* definitely take some getting used to. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I can't explain *why exactly*, but it's just *really easy* to *hit stuff*, compared to most top-down *Racing* Games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As *far as I can tell*, this race doesn't take place on a *closed course*, but rather on *public roads* where ya need to deal with things like *cable* cars and *cross* traffic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You *also* need to stop [and] get *gas*, from time to time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For *some reason*, you never have a full tank (even at the *beginning*). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {That} *seems like* very bad planning if you're gonna be competing in a race. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *this* is *actually* a [port] of *a <*Nineteen*-[Eighty-Eight]::[1988>* Taito] *Arcade* game, developed by *Toaplan*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the U.S., it was called "*Rally Bike*". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's actually not *bad* - sort of like "*Spy* Hunter", except in the form of a *motorcycle* race. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But the *Arcade* game was a lot *slicker* than the *FamiCom* port. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, when refilling your *gas* tank, ya get this animated *sequence*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Also*, the music is much more *pleasing*, the *graphics* are [pretty] nice looking, and it controls much better. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the *FamiCom* game, it just feels like you're racing on an [ice]-covered road; it's *weird*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Much* like in "Spy Hunter", ya get item drops from time to *time*; in *this* case a *helicopter* appears [and] *drops* stuff. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you *also* will occasionally encounter *platforms* that'll allow you to do a *jump*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *The whole concept* is [pretty] *weird*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is an *unusually* deadly race. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Sometimes* huge trucks come *behind* you and try [to] run you *down*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Have you ever seen "*Duel*", Steven Spielberg's first movie? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's kinda like *that*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, *this truck* is just murdering every single racer on the *road* - just *literally mowing* them down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And *then* parked *cars* just start pulling out onto the *road* when there's a motorcycle race going *on*!? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Is *everyone* in this town *crazy*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I *better* come in <First::1st> *place* [in] this race, because *I'm* the [only] one still *alive*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *I've recently* referred to certain games as *old*-school kusoge - bad games that're *not [only] bad*, but they look like games from <Nineteen-[Eighty]-Seven::1987> or <[Eighty]-*Six*::*'86*> instead of <Nineteen-Ninety::*1990*>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Dash Yarou" is one [of] those *games*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's *hard to believe* this was [actually developed in] <Nineteen-[*Ninety*]::*1990*>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe [it] was finished a few [years] earlier [and got] *shelved for a couple years*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Who* knows? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Well*, moving on. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Battle Fleet 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix) ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 June 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atlus 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Alright, here's* a game from *Namco* and *Atlus*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Calm down* though; this is not going to be to interest of *anyone*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 ({It has} nice drum sounds in the opening *music*, however!) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So "*Battle Fleet*" is a *very* text-heavy Military *Tactics* Game with lots of menus. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Compared to "*Fire Emblem*", this is a *very* dry game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Basically you're just *building* and *deploying* various military *units*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Pac-Man* was tried for *war* crimes after the events portrayed in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your two teams are red [and blue]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I *told ya* this is going to be *[pretty] dry*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Each level* is laid out in a *grid*: red on *one side*, blue on the *other*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The other side's forces have the black flag rather than a *blue* flag, [for] some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And ya have money that is spent on building *units*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's *lots* of choices of *ships*! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You also have tanks and *planes*! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Once [your] turn is over*, the other side does their thing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *As I mentioned*, the music is [pretty] nice. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *This game seems* [to] be forgotten even in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 More sophisticated Military Strategy Games like "The Three *Kingdoms*" had been around for a *while*, and this was actually released a mere *one year* before the first "*Civilization*" game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, for those into super realistic hardcore *War Sims*, there's [*probably*] a lot of better options on actual *computers*, I'm *sure*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *I recorded* about <fifteen::15> minutes of footage [for] this but there's *really* not much [to] *see* in the remaining <twelve::12> *minutes*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's just kinda moving ships around [and] airplanes [and] stuff. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If *ya wanna play this game, [for] some reason*, a [pretty] detailed guide on GameFAQs will tell ya what *all the menus do* [and] so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not that you would ever want to *do* that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Are you *crazy*? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Okay*, we have *one more game* left this *episode*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, I'll tell you what; it's a bit more exciting than "Battle Fleet". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Final Mission 🇯🇵 // S.C.A.T.: Special Cybernetic Attack Team 🇺🇸 // {Action in New York 🇬🇧} ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 June 22 🇯🇵 // 1991 June [?] 🇺🇸 // 1992 [?] [?] 🇬🇧 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Natsume 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Natsume 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 // {Infogrames 🇬🇧} 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 {It's} our final game this episode and we are almost done with June, at least with the Japanese releases. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As for the U.S.-and-Europe-[only] releases coming up next episode, all I have to say is, 'Hoo boy! We got some real garbage.'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This actually has a [pretty] rad introductory sequence, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Final Mission" is a decent little Shooter which resembles Capcom's "Forgotten Worlds", in the sense that you are a little guy who flies around, instead of being a spaceship that flies around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It was released in the U.S. in <Nineteen-[Ninety]-One::1991> under the unsavory name of "SCAT: Special Cybernetic Attack Team" with a completely revised opening sequence. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Then in <Nineteen-[Ninety]-Two::1992>, it got a European release and for some damn reason was retitled "Action in New York". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first level v... -- very well could take place in New York City, I suppose. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the U.S. version, you could choose between two characters - an Arnold Schwarzenegger dude or a Sigourney Weaver lady. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Often, Japanese Action Games are made harder for the U.S. market, but here the opposite happened. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "SCAT..." (the U.S. version) gives you more lives and you don't lose your weapons pickups when ya get hit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍋🍓 "You must destroy them!" 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 "The Earth is counting on you." 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 "Good luck!" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, in terms of pickups, there are speed-ups (marked 'S'), as well as a Health Refill (marked 'R'), which is very handy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's also a few weapons options: 'W' (which is a Wave Gun) and 'L' (a Laser) are [probably] the most useful weapons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You have two orbs that float around you and shoot projectiles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Using the A button, you can switch them between remaining stationary or automatically rotating. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And these are especially helpful when you're being attacked from above or below. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And in certain cases (such as when you're fighting a large stationary boss) you can lock them down so they fire nonstop at the enemy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first boss is this train/tank thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Bosses can be a little tricky, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This dude has multiple cannons (including some that fire at you from below) and also will lob cannonballs at you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Level <Two::2> is a cave of some sort where you'll be harassed by these little segmented snake things that kind of lunge at you and these little ships that fire tiny homing missiles, that move in a circular path, and are [pretty] hard to hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These things are utterly annoying. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 {The} second boss is a classic snake-style boss that wriggles around the screen, while you're trying to shoot it in the head. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Often, these types of enemies get, like, shorter as you shoot them, but not this guy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, to make matters worse, he also shoots those little homing missiles at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Probably] the Wave weapon (which I did not have) is the best option for this boss. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 {The} next level is one of those super fast vertical levels which is a little hard on the eyes and a bit headache-inducing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The difficulty starts ramping up quite a bit here, as everything is so damn fast and hard to see. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Fortunately, every level has a Health Refill before the boss. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This boss is just a series of huge mounted cannons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This one, right here, has three cannons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once ya destroy the top [and] bottom, you can set your orbs [to] fire safely from below. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then the S.O.B. starts firing missiles at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It basically involves shooting the missiles while carefully avoiding the Spread Shot, which alternates patterns with each volley. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 {The} next level starts off with what feels like an amped-up "Gradius" section and then an "R-Type" giant spaceship, packed with laser beams, turrets, [et] cetera on every surface. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One doesn't normally associate the name Natsume with Shooters though we've covered "Abadox..." a while back. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, there was also the 'Pocky & Rocky' games, which were more Run-'n'-Gun games but did feature a lot of shooting. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd say "SCAT..." is a solid B-tier Shooter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As mentioned, it's [pretty] damn hard. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies attack you from the front and back nonstop, and it can get very fast, at times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It just throws a lot of stuff at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the music, in particular, is [pretty] damn rad. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game [only] has five levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {The} total time to play through this is [probably] around a half hour. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The final boss is, like, I guess, the main alien dude(?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's really not that bad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He fires in a [pretty] simple repetitive pattern. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just move out of the way when that gray skull face shoots all those things out of its mouth. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright! So, mission accomplished! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and the President is throwing you a parade. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The ending is [pretty] goofy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Arnold does sort of, like, a 'James Bond' thing where [at] the end his superiors are telling him, 'Yeah, the President wants to congratulate you.'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But Arnold just wants to relax and does the whole, 'I can't hear you; the radio must be on the fritz.'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, instead of banging some chick, he's just chilling at the beach. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And hey! That's the last game this episode! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's wrap it up. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 61 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright! We're finally *finished* with this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {It's} certainly not the greatest selection of games that we've ever *seen*, so *for* the Best Game this episode, I think there's [*probably*] really [only] *one choice*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And that, of course, would be the "Chip 'n Dale...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, again, this is [definitely not] the best Capcom game that we've ever seen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... We'll [definitely] see better ones in the *future*! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Worst Game*: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm almost kind of tempted to give it to "Snake's Revenge", just because I hate that game so much. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Kind of the same thing with "*Castle* Quest", now that I think about it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Honestly, I kind of wish I could almost put, like, everything that's *not* "Chip 'n Dale..." in as the, uh -- the Be... -- the Worst Game, this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know; {I} guess that's cheating. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, what about next episode? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Are the games gonna get any better? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I guess it kinda depends. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you like, for example, games published by American *Sammy* or Milton *Bradley*, then I guess you're [in] luck! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, once again, thanks [for] watching and I'll see ya soon. 🍇🍌
