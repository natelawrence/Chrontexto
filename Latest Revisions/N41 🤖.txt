👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 41 ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Well <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> is here at last and this episode we'll cover every game from January <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> - <SIXTEEN::16> games altogether. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ 1988: The Year In Review ✨


🤖🍊🍓 But first, let's take a look back at <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This was a landmark year for Nintendo as the system was entering its middle years, when it was established as a huge success in both the U.S. and Japan, but had not yet been rendered obsolete by the 'Sonic'-era Genesis or the Super FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> was, sort of, a transitional moment in world history. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Cold War was winding down. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was the final year of Ronald Reagan's presidency in the United States. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the Soviet Union the political reforms known as perestroika began under Gorbachev. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later today year the U.S.S.R. withdrew from Afghanistan. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And elsewhere the Iran/Iraq war finally came to an end. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Some new concerns were rising however, the Pan Am Flight <ONE-O-THREE::103> bombing which killed over <TWO-HUNDRED::200> people happened December. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Years later, Libya would acknowledge that they were behind the attack. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the modern era of computer viruses arrived with the Morris Worm. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first well-known worm be spread over the internet, supposedly infecting around <TEN-PERCENT::10%> of online computers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the movie theaters, Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Bruce Willis were probably the biggest stars. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And in the music world many of the biggest records that year those from Michael Jackson, George Michael, and Guns 'n' Roses were actually holdovers from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In terms of the FamiCom <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> saw around <TWO-HUNDRED::200> distinct games released both in Japan and the U.S. - the most in a single year so far. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I thought we'd examine the major genres of the games that year to see what was, sort of, most popular on the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I decided not to include like U.S.-[only] games, since they mostly consist of Arcade ports and didn't really fit into the larger pattern. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Not surprisingly, the biggest genre was the classic side-scrolling Action Game with about <thirty-three::33> titles released. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now this is a rather wide category. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The way I defined it would include both games to "Super Mario Bros." and "Metroid". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the idea is that any game which is removed left to right, jumping and killing stuff falls in this category. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It comprises around <SEVENTEEN-PERCENT::17%> of all games considered. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I did exclude some games without films and distinct genres. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, the Run-'n'-Gun, which contains both side view and top-down variations had five games - most notably "Contra". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Likewise, there were five Beat-'em-Up games, which are defined as games in which the primary object is to hit people, the standout being "Double Dragon". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, there were three games I consider to be Fighting Games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In these dark pre-"Street Fighter II" today's Fighting Games are not really a huge concern for gamers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Moving along the next big genre was Sports Games with <twenty-four::24> titles, mostly Baseball and Golf with a few Soccer, Tennis, and Track & Field games - also "Super Dodgeball". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This makes about <THIRTEEN-PERCENT::13%> of the FamiCom releases. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The biggest monolithic genre was of course, the Adventure Game, not Action Adventure, but you know, "Portopia" Adventure. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There were <twenty-one::21> of these things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And, unlike Sports and side-scrolling Action Games, they tend to be very similar to each other and look in mechanics. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At about <ELEVEN-PERCENT::11%> you can see how -- just how popular these things were on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> can be summed up in just three words for the FamiCom, it would be Military Strategy Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This genre basically went from <ZERO-PERCENT::0%> to <EIGHT-PERCENT::8%> of FamiCom releases almost overnight, or a total of <FIFTEEN::15> games throughout <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like R.P.G.s and Adventure Games, stretch games started off on computers like the P.C.-88 and then jumped to the to FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Quite a few of them had some Goku Era settings. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Moving on to the smaller genres, we have the Shoot-'em-Up with <eleven::11> games or about <SIX-PERCENT::6%>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 While Shoot-'em-Ups were a huge presence in our caves at this time, there really weren't a whole lot of ports to the FamiCom, the big one being of course, "Gradius II". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also there were <eleven::11> games and what I'm going to call the top-down Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some have action, some really don't; but they all involve wandering around a large world looking for something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Often they have a certain amount of communication with N.P.C.s. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A couple might be called "...Zelda" clones, but these games were actually rarer than you might think. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also having a surprisingly small showing, were R.P.G.s with <eleven::11> games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You think the FamiCom is being posed to tons of 'Dragon Quest' clones, but there really weren't that many. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Several these were western style "Wizardry", clones or Action R.P.G.s like "<EASE::Ys>". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We also have <nine::9> Racing Games or about <FIVE-PERCENT::5%> - mostly <F-ONE::F1> racers, go also a Bicycle Racer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nothing really stands out here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 <Eight::8> games I called Simulation Games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That would be stuff like Stock Market Simulation or Fortune-Telling Games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They also include a Fishing Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So a little over <FOUR-PERCENT::4%>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Likewise, we have eight Board Games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There were some - "Xiong", "Game of Life", that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Perhaps the most well-known in the future will be "Momotaro Dentetsu". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Tetris" hit Japan in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I included the Puzzle genre, but [only] come up with three games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oh, well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And finally, we had <EIGHTEEN::18> games I couldn't really categorize or were very minor genres such as Pinball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, you know, maybe Pinball could have been its own category. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But there were also a Quiz Games, Karaoke Games, and weird stuff like "Yuu Maze". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's almost <TEN-PERCENT::10%>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So that covers the genres, but what were the biggest, most influential or best games of the year? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, of course, that's highly subjective, but I would offer the following list. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Of course, there is "Super Mario Bros. <THREE::3>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also, I would say "Mega Man <TWO::2>" from Capcom, "Ninja Gaiden" from Tecmo, "Bionic Commando" also from Capcom, "Blaster Master" from Sunsoft, and "...Guardian Legend" from Compile an IREM. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 All these aside from "...Guardian Legend" I put into the side-scrolling Action genre. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, there was commies "Contra" in the Run-'n'-Gun genre. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And Technos Japan's "Double Dragon", the game that popularized the beat. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Both were Arcade ports that did quite well on pub console. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Strategy Games, we have "Romance of The Three Kingdoms", the best known series in terms of Japanese Strategy Games, but also Nintendo's "FamiCom Wars" the most interesting pure Military Tactics Game we saw. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This was not really a great year for Shoot-'em-Ups, but we did have gregorious to nominee. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In terms of R.P.G.s [only] to really stuck out "Dragon Quest III" and "Final Fantasy II". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Least series remain the most popular and visible J.R.P.G.s to this very day. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And there we have it - <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> in a nutshell. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now let's begin with <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ganbare Goemon! 2 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January 04 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Who kicks off <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Konami, of course, with "Ganbare Goemon! <TWO::2>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Be covered "Ganbare Goemon! (<ONE::1>)" way back in "Chrontendo ... <NINE::9>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It came out in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SIX::1986> around the same time as "Metroid". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The '...Goemon!' series is almost unknown outside of Japan. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But we do have an English translation from Stardust Crusaders. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game introduces a series regular PBS tomorrow and offended chubby ninja, who is supposedly based on the real life 19 Robin Hood like individual called g ro PG the rat or nezumi kozo. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You may remember that going on himself is based on Ishikawa Goemon, another legendary Japanese folk hero thief. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Give me some arrow functions as the second player character in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So while in jail, maybe tomorrow convinces Goemon to escape and hunt down some treasure found in a castle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Thus we start off as go mon as he makes his jailbreak. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can enter the cells and talk to folks, but outside of humans remarks or some background story, they don't really say much useful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I do like this one guys comment however. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Ganbare Goemon! <TWO::2>" is very similar to first game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a side-scrolling Action Adventure Game with a weird perspective that can't really be called isometric. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The backgrounds are completely flat, but we view the ground from a bird's eye view. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first order of business is to upgrade your weapon from the pipe to a throwing point. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Having a ranged weapon will make all the difference in the world in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Jumping around on near the gourd through cause an item to pop out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Often a lucky cat that will be the is a better weapon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you already have a coin weapon, you don't want to upgrade again to the useless fireworks weapon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However, almost as essential as the ranged weapons are the hidden underground passages. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These can be found by jumping around randomly until you just happen to find what. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yeah, you see, this is one of those old-school games where everything is hidden in random spots. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 By <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> this already, sort of, falling out of fashion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 These underground passages containing money, Life Bar upgrades, and the passes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The number of passes you have is displayed in the bottom right-hand corner. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first level actually does not have any passes at all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And these passages also act as huge shortcut sometimes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The passage found a very beginner level actually take you to the castle at the end of the level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first two '...Goemon!' games are vaguely "...Zelda"-like so they have shops along with hidden items like are extensions and so on. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, the first boss is a robot sumo who throws his top knot at you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The guy is [pretty] easy if you have the coins. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Ganbare Goemon! <TWO::2>" is one of those wacky Japanese games that throws in various anachronisms and wild random stuff. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 To expect to see a lot of silly things like the sumo robots. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You can take one hit and then you'll go back to the pipe weapon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 After that your life will decrease every time you get hit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once you defeat this guy, you get a cutscene of go on giving out money to the regular folk, then you're off Level <Two::2>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are <ten::10> levels all together. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As I mentioned, there are shops in this game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Much of the each level consists of city streets line with buildings you can enter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Not all them are useful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can buy food replenisher health as well as helpful items. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Each level is basically made up of a series of horizontal streets connected at various points to move up and down at intersections from street to street. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it's a lot like ballasts or "Rambo" or (God forbid) and the first level of "Platoon". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 [Only] it's much used to navigate because the screens don't all look exactly the same. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now here's another important part, mazes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These cost money to enter, but they contain the all important passes as well as box of treasure that usually contain money. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Did you know the back of the Eto Period of Japan most villages have large indoor mazes you could enter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yep, and inside each maze with town, the map passed into Ed's village, and several boxes of gold coins just lying around on the ground. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The real mystery is why more people didn't frequent these mazes, just pick up the gold coins. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And how did the maze owners actually keep going out of business where he's talking to mazes? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 See video games teach you a lot about history. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The overall goal of each level is basically just to reach the end level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And to exit you actually have to have the three passes in your inventory. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Underground passes and mazes are your main source for passes but you can also buy them in shops if you can't find the hidden passages or don't like the mazes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once you have three passes, you can exit the gate and move on to the next level - in most levels that is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game does switched up just a bit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, "...Goemon..." is chock full of funny stuff, like the between level cutscenes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Or here you can enter a bathhouse for a fee. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you enter the men's bath, you will relax and get your health refilled. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Enter the women's bath and you will get a bucket print you causing you to lose health. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Game is full of weird enemies like this guy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's the baby card assassin a.k.a. lol cub from the comics and they show an assassin movie. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If you run a live and die, it will get this sequence which go mon is lower into a boiling cauldron. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Bathtubs hidden by a fire blow are called Goemon tubs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Since the real life Goemon was apparently executed by being lowered into a pot of boiling oil along with his infant son. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's rather over-the-top method of execution. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 A personal note about Goemon tubs: 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a story in my family that when my great grandmother was living in Hawaii many many years ago, as a young child, two of her siblings were playing or the house of old jazz and he's lady neighborhood when she grabbed them and threw them into a Goemon tub and wash them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some reason they thought that she was going to cook them but probably she was just really offended by their extreme filthiness. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Later bosses of giant peach would spit out little demons, perhaps a reference to Momotaro the peach boy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The boss guards the last pass you need to enter this picker level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is all [pretty] goofy, but later games in the series got even nuttier. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Super FamiCom games are perhaps a bit more well-known since the first one was released in the West as "Legend of Mystical Ninja". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 By this point, the game completely mixed up historical Japan with Sci-Fi and fantasy elements in a completely insane fashion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However, go on to is [pretty] restrained by comparison. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's [pretty] similar to the first '...Goemon!' game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Most distinctive elements such as the maze, the hidden passages, finding passes, are all found in the first game as well. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But going on to has better graphics, more variety in the level design, and a much sillier sense of humor. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Aside from the village level do occasionally have levels a moment of platforming, or these vertically moving sections such as crossing this enormous bridge. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And other times we'll get a climate giant staircase and so on. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But going on to still seems a bit old-fashioned; the graphics are not exactly cutting-edge. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first goal one game was known as being the very first to make FamiCom cart. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "...Goemon! <TWO::2>" a still <two::2> Megs and doesn't even have any extra RAM. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well below two is the superior game, I don't know this way it looks like a sequel that was worth three years of late. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Remember, of course, that the first golang game was a huge hit for Konami. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was actually, I believe, Konami's best selling FamiCom game in Japan, and one of their biggest seller stories ever, I'm sure was later surpassed by "Dance Dance Revolution" or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh, and one vital thing you must buy is the armor. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It allows you to take a lot of hits before taking any damage or losing your best weapon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's easy to get hit a lot in this game, so the armor is very important. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The second your armor wears off are looking for shops that sell it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's a funny end of this level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You enter the castle but not the castle you were looking for. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Daimyo pulls out some princes total attitude, and then go on beats the crap out of them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the second half of the game, you'll encounter more bosses including a shadowy Goemon clone, a large red bear, and another robot guy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 None of the bosses are difficult exactly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Or rather, they aren't difficult if you have the coin throwing weapon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The bosses all bruised slowly and don't have any like hard to dodge or devastating attacks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 By "Castlevania" standards that these guys are a piece of cake. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He mostly a stand on the other side of the screen that should have all your coins. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Finally, you'll reap the last level, Level <Ten::10>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The entire level is large castle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As I mentioned when equipped with the armor and the weapons upgrade as well as the white sandals for speed, dealing with enemies is not that difficult. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The hardest part about this game is finding your way around each level and finding the hidden passages and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there's a lot of weird and hidden stuff in this game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, Level <Ten::10> can be a bit tricky to navigate - lots of doors similar looking hallways. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's also a series of mini-Bosses, including us rather "Gradius" looking at me. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 With a coin weapon, he's as simple as pie. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Thankfully, the castle is also full of shops so you can refill your health, purchase armor, and find the weapons upgrade if you got hit and ended up with a bad weapon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There are a few frustrating things like during the council boss battles. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's too easy to actually touch the bottom of the room and exit the door by mistake (that's forcing you to restart the boss fight). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the final boss is a boy head. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Konami was quite fond of these sorts of crossovers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The guy appears to be completely resistant to your attacks however, you can shoot those rather suspicious-looking cameras in corners. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is the brother odd similarity to make a man to. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once the holographic projectors artist troy this guy turns out to be a fraud. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He's just a dude on a pogo stick. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can now just shoot him until he dies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And then that's it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You've beaten "Ganbare Goemon! <TWO::2>". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the closing cutscene you finally get your hands on the mysterious treasure. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But when you open it, you get one completely screwed up ending. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It turns out that Abby's tomorrow is actually a girl who is afflicted with some sort of curse that could [only] be lifted by opening the box down in the castle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There is no treasure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oddly, the next '...Goemon!' game and he Massaro is back to his regular self and this is never mentioned again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As for the girl, she says thanks goes home mostly been going on with a serious case of blue balls. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then you get the closing credits. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Ganbare Goemon! <TWO::2>" is, sort of, a mixed bag. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a definite improvement over the first, the game is quite clever and creative, but the boss battles and combat in general is [pretty] easy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you ever lose a life it's gonna be due to the fact that Goemon ends up [pretty] close to the edge of this as it scrolls, those who often unexpectedly run into enemies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The main challenge is finding your way in throughout the levels and uncovering the hidden areas. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So it's a good game but not quite on levels the contrast of 'Gradius' games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Space Harrier 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January 06 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Takara 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 What? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Come on Sega. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Really? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Space Harrier" on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This title screen is so ugly! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This version is published by the car of all people the toy company. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the video game field are mostly known for stuff like the FamiCom 'Transformers' games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, no idea who ported this but it's [pretty] lame - no speech samples, teeny tiny sprites. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The <THREE-D::3D> effects aren't really that convincing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The ships coming towards you [only] have like two different sprite sizes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Really any illusion things moving towards you is [pretty] much lost in this version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The final bot is actually kind of difficult to decipher. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He can't really tell when the fireballs he shoots are going to hit you due to the lack of sprite scaling. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's really best to stay away from no completely as of spacing you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still I guess this could be worse. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Wasn't "Space Harrier" also released for the Z.X. Spectrum? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe that would have been the absolute worst version. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But really the FamiCom version of space hurry has no reason to exist. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 100 Man Dollar Kid: Maboroshi no Teiou Hen 🇯🇵 // Casino Kid 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January 06 🇯🇵 // <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SOFEL 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by SOFEL 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, yet another awful opening sequence. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This date in effect is actually [pretty] misguided. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What we have here is the oddly-named "<ONE-HUNDRED::100> Man Dollar Kid: Maboroshi no Teiou Hen" from SOFEL. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You might recall their last game, "The Money Game". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That was a Stock Market Simulation-type Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well "<ONE-HUNDRED::100> Man Dollar Kid..." is a Gambling Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The idea is to make some fake money. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now there are two modes free and quest. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Free allows you to play various one-off games with the different opponents. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The characters here from the quest mode. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here's roulette. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Clicker playing against Wolverine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Another option is slot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Exactly what it looks like. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's also poker blackjack, we'll discuss that in a second. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So here's the thing this was released in the U.S. under the name "Casino Kid". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, the free option was removed entirely leaving [only] the best option. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So let's take a look. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Literally this takes place in Las Vegas. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Ah, now we see why it's called a questionable; it looks like "Dragon Quest". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Note that the kids hair is blonde. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can go around and talking to various casino patrons and employees including the standard bunny girl. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And now his hair is brown. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However, in order to access or start the game, you can talk to one particular guy here in the corner. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If this game expects to go around talking to every single N.P.C. and we just happen to reach this guy who actually playing poker with you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So now your hair is still brown, but your opponent's hairs turn green. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Sweet dealer? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess this translation is a little weird. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So poker is... well it's poker. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can place bets, raise, old, call. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your first opponent is [pretty] easy to read. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Can be pleased or upset depending on the quality of his hand. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As I mentioned, the free option was removed for the U.S. game, but in fact, quite a few changes were made. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here's the first option from a Japanese game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, wow! The colors backgrounds and sprites are all different. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Andrew character has black hair here and blue hair here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They just couldn't keep his hair straight either version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Furthermore, in the U.S. version, you can [only] play poker and blackjack; slots roulette have been completely removed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the Japanese game, for example, you can walk up to a slot machine or roulette table and start playing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The whole quest option was simplified quite a bit and actually was quite a lot of stuff cut out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's almost an entirely different game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The object here is simply to deprive your opponent of all his money. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once you've beaten him, you are then free to wander around and find the next player on the list. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You also need to do this with blackjack as well. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once you've beaten everyone you can face down the King of Gamblers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Casino Kid" seems [pretty] decent. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's just odd that so much was removed from the U.S. version - two out of four games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later these were put back into "Casino Kid <TWO::2>" which was a U.S. release is many of the same assets as the first "Casino Kid". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For some reason "Casino Kid <TWO::2>" didn't amount to him <NINETEEN-NINETY-THREE::1993>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, moving right along. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Halley Wars 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January 14 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ITL 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We didn't have a whole lot of F.D.S. games last two episodes, but here's one now, "Halley Wars" (or perhaps "Halley Wars" if you prefer). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Man that is some ugly music! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This game is not exactly titles finest moment. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Halley Wars" was outsourced to a company called itl, apparently. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We have a little plot about Halley's Comet coming around and heading towards Earth, but it turns out to be full of alien ships. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a rather clever way of sneaking in a space lead. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game is actually named after Halley's comet, which was named after Edmund Halley, a.k.a. Edmund Halley. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 No one really knows exactly how his name was pronounced or even spelled. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, after Earth space Cletus destroyed naturally you get sent to clean up the entire invasion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alley wars is not surprisingly a Shoot-'em-Up the one of the simplest Shoot-'em-Ups imaginable. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Fly to space shooting enemies and come down little waves. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What's weird is you can shoot the little planets that look like they're in the background and sometimes they'll drop power-ups. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You might think they're a little asteroids or something, but their position is fixed relative to the background star field, so they must actually be really far away from you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game originally appeared in arcades in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SIX::1986>, which makes sense because that was the year that Halley's Comet was making its turn to Earth as it does every <seventy-six::76> years or so. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Even by <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SIX::1986> standards, it was, sort of, primitive. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Compare this to derrius, which actually came out the same year. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You know, on the Arcade Game, it's clear those little planet things are relatively close to you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They move on a separate plane from the stars. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess the F.D.S. could not reproduce those multi plane effects. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 No unique factor and "Halley Wars" is the Damage Meter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Halley Wars" answer one question always left unanswered by other Shoot-'em-Ups: "what happens to all the enemy ships you don't shoot down?". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well in this case it turns out they keep on moving towards Earth. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And each enemy that escapes causes the earth Damage Meter to go up, as they presumably start bombing the planet, sending down ways of in the shock troops, do unspeakable things to the women of Earth. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Since this is a Japanese game, no, that involves tentacles. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, the bottom line is don't let these guys get past you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If the Earth Damage Meter, which is <ONE-HUNDRED-PERCENT::100%> it's Game Over. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I was hoping for a cutscene of the Earth exploding or something, but nope. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So here's the problem with "Halley Wars"; maybe figured out watching this video. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's boring! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 [Pretty] much the whole game looks like this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once you get a few power-ups, the game starts getting super easy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your weaponry doesn't really look like much but it can take on a boss and a few moments if you're fully powered up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And during regular levels, he barely even have to move your ship around. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can, sort of, park in the middle firing constantly and in a wipeout spot everything headed your way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you get careless and die, the game will get much harder into the power-up again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But overall, it's definitely a lot easier than your typical Konami or Compile Shooter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So "Halley Wars" is definitely not the worst Shooter we've ever seen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it's one that choice not that interesting either. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Satomi Hakkenden 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by SNK 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Lord, that some terrible music! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That can't even be called the melody! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So this is "Satomi Hakkenden", published by S.N.K.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not clear who really developed this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the production I use seem relatively high based on the opening sequence. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The artwork is [pretty] good. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's certainly more visually appealing the "Athena" or the 'Ikari...' games, that's for sure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once we started the game we realized this is yet another "Dragon Quest"-inspired game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It is it's from what I seen a [pretty] much by-the-numbers R.P.G.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There is, however, interesting less we found out games based on existing properties. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the West, games that are not based on original stories or characters are generally taken from popular movies, comics, toys, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The same is true for Japan, but there's also a lot of games based on well-known literary works. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Nando Satomi Hakkenden" (or "Eight Dog Chronicles") was a <NINETEENTH::19th> Century novel by one kill could a bokken. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We've also seen plenty of games based on classic Chinese novels. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, do you ever see video games like this in the U.S.? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Can you imagine an 'Oliver Twist' video game or a 'Moby Dick' game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It seems unlikely. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So one way this book has been adapted into movies many, many times. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Probably the most well-known is the <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-THREE::1983> movie directed by Kenji Fukasawa, who some of you might know as the director of "Battle Royale", among other things. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This movie was called "Legend of the Samurai" in English. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Weirdly, the film features and use it by a minor American pop singer called jonelle banyans to became popular in Japan because of this movie. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, back to the domain of Kenda in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You've got the classic <EIGHT::8>-bit J.R.P.G. battles here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're your typical fight magic and run options. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You start off by doing the usual pattern of fight a few battles and you go back to begin and heal. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Early on, it's quite easy to get killed because you're most apps. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 After you obtain some cash, you can buy better weapons and whatnot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You also need to find the other party members. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here's the first one. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He has some magic, starting off with a very useful 'Heal' spell. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This helps improve your cash flow because you're now not spending all your money at the end healing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Satomi Hakkenden" doesn't really contain much of a thing we haven't seen before. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Still, it's interesting to note that at this stage in their career, even S.N.K. was bruising "Dragon Quest" clones. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tecmo Baseball 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tecmo 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, it's "Tecmo Baseball", or least suppose supposedly in January <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We're gonna take a look at a few releases for the western market that came out in January. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is one of those games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It never came out in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Tecmost what a highlight of the Americanness of this game by placing the stars and stripes prominently in the game logo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One way there is nothing really new here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's one player, to player, watch. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Does anyone ever used that mode? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's an all star game option. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now one, sort of, unusual feature is the designated hitter option. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I suppose that would be handy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Obviously, there are no rules life team names are full names of the players, just cities and names that suggest certain players. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You probably know the drill by now: pick the team, pick a starting pitcher. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Tecmo Baseball" goes for quasi-realistic players. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're not those cute little super deformed guys from the Namco 'Family Stadium' games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But they have really small heads and like these long cartoon character noses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game just mostly chugs along like any typical N.E.S. Baseball Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Quite frankly, I can barely remember anything specific from when I played it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have a few pitching options are fastball, slow ball, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There were filters seemed to move really slowly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like here the ball is rolling along the ground much faster than you can run. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And if there was a prize for worse depiction of a crowd spectators and <EIGHT::8>-bit Sports Game, Tecmo might win the prize. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It looks like a fabric pattern or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Overall, "Tecmo Baseball" is completely underwhelming. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not terrible. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It just seems unnecessary since there are already so many Baseball Games for the system. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I was hoping for something special like the Baseball equivalent of "Tecmo Bowl" or something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But nope, it's just a regular old somewhat lame <EIGHT::8>-bit Baseball Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 WWF Wrestlemania 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, we got to pump the music, Hulk Hogan ripping his shirt off. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 No, this is gonna be awesome. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Who are we kidding? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is just another licensed title from Acclaim. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "W.W.F. Wrestlemania" is the first 'W.W.F.' video game, as far as I know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The weird thing is that one line on this screen: Hulk Hogan trademark of Marvel Comics group. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yeah, Marvel Comics didn't really care for the wrestler referring to them as Hulk. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So for many years the 'W.W.F.' actually to license the name Hulk Hogan from Marvel. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Eventually Hogan himself to obtain the full rights to the name. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So looking here up to six players. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's also a typical tournament mode long with one-off matches called the standard mode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is Acclaim's of second U.S. market and yes game (the first being "Wizards & Warriors"). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This one was also developed by Rare. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As I stated a while back just about every U.S.-[only] N.E.S. game released by a non-Japanese publisher during this time period and will be developed by Rare or Rare affiliate. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You get to choose between six real life wrestlers - Hogan (horse), as well as on rhythm giant, Ted DiBiase, Bam Bam Bigelow, Randy Savage, and Honky Tonk Man. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We've seen a few Wrestling Games so far, most notably, Nintendo's "Wrestling". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That was a few years ago and things really haven't progressed much. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Each wrestler has a handful of moves, a punch, a kick, headbutt, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But unlike Nintendo's Game, there's nothing really distinctive about each character. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They don't have any crazy screws or anything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, not every wrestlers mood set is exactly the same, but they're all [pretty] close. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Grapples would become a part of wrestling video games, but there's nothing like that here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's basically just punch, kick, elbow smash, et cetera and totally enemies energy gets worn down. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game's A.I. is completely mindless. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 AI opponents just, sort of, wander around randomly and occasionally attack you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can often corner them and it's, sort of, spam them with easy form attacks over and over again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However, some controls are [pretty] tough to pull off, like like pinning down a ball opponent. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Apparently it's supposed to be be up or down. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But you can do this over and over again and nothing happens. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I normally just start pressing the buttons randomly as fast as I can until magically you just perform the pinning action. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There we go. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It really shouldn't be that hard. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also special items that refill your energy will appear from time to time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The bottom line is "W.W.F. Wrestlemania" has [only] one thing going for it - the 'W.W.F.' license. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game is historically important because it introduced the Acclaimed practice of buying the rights to something and then tacking the license on to a generic or indifferently designed game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Let the name sell the product, not the actual game itself. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This worked for them for quite a while. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And were one of the most successful publishers for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But of course, eventually things changed and they ended up going bankrupt much later. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sesame Street 123 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Zippo Games 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hi Tech Expressions 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Wow, not a lot of effort went to that title screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This one doesn't really bring 'Sesame Street' to mind. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nor for that matter, does anything is it good this game resembles 'Sesame Street''s music. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is really just a generic kiddie game with Ernie and Grover paste it in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, there are two main game options, and each one has a few different variations. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Despite all the different names, the [only] real difference here is the difficulty level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 What's weird is that you move the cursor down by pressing the D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But hitting up on the D-Pad won't cause the cursor to move up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Instead, you move the cursor all the way to the bottom option, then it will start moving up again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And once it reaches the top, it'll start moving down again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess these simplified controls are for kids who don't understand the concepts of up or down. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Or nice game just requires you to decide whether a shape and color matches or not. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The one interesting thing is the pattern of the stars that revolve around the magic hat. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's like they've been stretched into form in order to give the stars a somewhat <THREE-D::3-D> appearance. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's odd that the programmers put that much effort into one little touch like that, especially when the entire rest of the game just screams 'Hey, let's go knock this out as quick as possible so we can head to the pub.'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This game was published by Hi Tech Expressions a New York video game publisher that released lots of basic kiddie games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They ended up getting absorbed into Ubisoft. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I assume that they hired Rare to produce this since it ended up in the hands of Zippo games, who were was using for sub-contracting at the time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Zippo was run by yet another pair of brothers, the Pickfords with British developer binary design in order to found Zippo. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They did a few games for Rare before being bought out by the Stampers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And "Sesame Street <ONE-TWO-THREE::123>" is actually [pretty] disappointing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You don't really expect much from a game like this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But sesame tree is a long-running T.V. series. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It has like a large and well-known cast of characters. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The neighborhood has a number of distinct locations, and over the years they produce tons of catchy songs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Aside from the appearances of Ernie and Grover, absolutely none of that is reproduced here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Why does the U.F.O. hover over some generic suburban name instead of, you know, Sesame Street. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game is actually called "Sesame Street <ONE-TWO-THREE::123>" and that particular iconic building doesn't even make an appearance. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What do you oppose and aliens have anything to do with 'Sesame Street'? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why not have the count counting bats or something? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So not [only] is this like a crappy license kiddie game, but one that doesn't make use of that source material. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nishimura Kyoutarou Mystery: Blue Train Satsujin Jiken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by SNK 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One thing I've learned from 'Chrontendo', is that IREM released a whole lot of weird FamiCom games that I've never heard of. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When you think of IREM now probably think of "R-Type", maybe "Kung-Fu Master" "Vigilante". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But in 'Chrontendo', we see them putting stuff out like electronic jigsaw puzzles, Military Strategy Games, and, of course, Murder Mystery Adventure Games - such as "Nishimura Kyoutarou Mystery: Blue Train Satsujin Jiken". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Note the train theme here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The opening sequences are [pretty] good and feature some cool stylized artwork. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Remind me of Bernie Kriegstein. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He was a comic artist from back in the day (when comic artists actually knew how to draw, in case you're wondering). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It appears that a Japanese pop singer figures into this somehow. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "...Blue Train Satsujin Jiken" is a [pretty] slick looking game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's got [pretty] good art music. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The character portraits actually have a certain amount of character to them, which is surprising it because Tose was involved. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the guy mentioned in the title, Nishimura Kyoutarou, is a popular Japanese Mystery author. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is actually the second FamiCom Adventure Game to bear the imprint of a real life Mystery novelist. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, he seems to have a fascination with trains and travel. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Over the years his name has appeared on many different Adventure Games from all sorts of different companies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Recently Tecmo released a couple of D.S. games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I believe this is supposed to be him here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There was also a P.S.P. game published by marvelous not that long ago. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In gameplay terms, there's really nothing too new here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have the same menu we've seen in a dozen or so games already. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Move around from location to location, look at things, talk people. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Really aren't puzzles on the store you find in western venture games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's mostly all about telling the story. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still, compared to some of the but ugly Adventure Games we've seen this looks and sounds [pretty] decent. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, IREM and Tose, good job! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Advance Communication 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We have just one game from January <TWENTY-FOUR::24> it's another F.D.S. game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's called "Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor" (or "Patlabor Mobile police"). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And guess what - it's based on animated T.V. show about mobile police. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You see in the future police we mobile unlike the police of today, which are stationary. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You think good if you want to make your police force more mobile you'd give them cars or helicopters or something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But since this is Japan the police get giant robot toots, which probably cost like <FIVE-HUNDRED-MILLION-DOLLARS::$500 million> each. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And seriously, where does the police force get that kind of money? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess property taxes are really high in the future. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Come on being on am a loving crowd the pet labor cartoon is mostly known for making an appearance in the kmfdm video for the song join decibel following the great music tradition of inserting random weird footage to make your low budget video look a little more interesting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And in case you're wondering, 'patlabor' comes from 'patrol labor'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't know why or what that's supposed to mean. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game starts off with the training stage, which is shooting targets. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, the crosshairs are super sensitive and hard to control. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's really difficult to get a lineup exactly where the targets are gently touching the D-Pad causes the crosshairs to fly halfway across the screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The training section makes you think this is gonna be a first-person Shooting Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But this really isn't the case. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You select your characters here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The second character takes over if the first one dies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They have slightly different weapons types so it's, sort of, like that loop and the third game in that sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once the main game starts, you'll see it's a side-scrolling Action Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So what was the training level for? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 How does that vary for this? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I assume maybe there are first-person shooting cycles later in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't know because I've got that for myself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So here's what you do. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Walk forward attack everything that comes your way with your lightsaber thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It breaks boxes for health and ammo. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The ammo for your blaster weapon which would be more useful if it didn't have such limited ammunition. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's weird that a tank can be destroyed with one hit of the lightsaber, and it takes like four hits to break open a wooden crate. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If I was the guy manufacturing those tanks, I'd make them out of whatever material the crates are made out of. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Occasionally an open door appears and you can enter a warehouse and rescue some kids. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At least having pleased rescue children makes sense as opposed to having say a ninja or Michael Jackson rescuing children like him find them sales games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So a couple problems I had playing this game: 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One is that I think you have to find all the kids before you can leave a level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And apparently I missed some kids because I made it all the way to the far right-hand side of the level and nothing happened. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I couldn't exit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also when you die you start over completely at the beginning and level of no rescued kids. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This wouldn't be so bad if level wasn't so long and monotonous. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Patlabor was developed by advanced communication, who's, sort of, most famous for that "Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde" game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That just like that game Patlabor has, sort of, this boring level design and annoying enemies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So you can kind of see the similarities. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Bottom line is that this game is just for cheap crap from Bandai. 🍇🍌

🤖🍊🍓 January <TWENTY-SIX::26> is here and it is a very special day. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You see, for the last two years we've been troubled by Bandai's 'Family Trainer' games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now last or tournament comes to an end with "...Rai Rai! Kyonshizu", the very final 'Family Trainer' game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is the <tenth::10th> game in the series and I for one am glad to be done with them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And yes, this is yet another FamiCom game based around the Chinese jumping vampires. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Just like the last 'Family Trainer' game, this was based on a T.V. show. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In this case, it's a crappy Kids T.V. show based around a little hopping vampire. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This looks [pretty] bad even for <NINETEEN-EIGHTIES::1980s> Japanese T.V. standards. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The intro shows how it gets separated from his family of vampires. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the game is for up to three players. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Take turns progressing down a path, which has various challenges along the way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And most of these involve hopping, naturally. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's one way to jump around a being this guy's knives or trying to pick up stars and bananas. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Stars and bananas? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, what would a vampire what was bananas? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In another one, you need to avoid this hugging vampire guy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Or here's one way to jump from the log the log like fraud or. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At least near the end of the series, Bandai did get a bit creative. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Most of the games that got released for the Power Pad in the U.S. were just generic sports and race titles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Regardless, I am enormously grateful to never have to worry about another 'Family Trainer' game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There actually will be one more Power Pad game from Nintendo themselves released later in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's, like, a whole nother story. 🍇🍌

🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so we've reached January <TWENTY-SEVEN::27> already. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Boy the month is just flying by! Hmm. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's another sequel that you weren't asking for: "Zoids <TWO::2>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The original game come out in September <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There was also an M.S.X. version that game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Two was [only] on the FamiCom, as far as I know. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And once again, this comes to us courtesy of Toshiba E.M.I. and developer Micronics. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Array Micronics. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 'Zoids' was (and still is) a series of toys which are all giant robots shaped like animals or dinosaurs for some stupid reason. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There have been many many 'Zoids' games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A few even came out in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The most were Military Strategy type games, but the FamiCom "Zoids" was a straight up "Dragon Quest"-inspired game that used first-person shooting battles instead of turn-based battles for enemy encounters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Zoids <TWO::2>" makes a bit more sense than its predecessor, because you play as people instead of the actual Zoids. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 While inside a building, you walk around in normal human form and interact with normal people. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then you hop into your robot to travel to the overworld. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the first game you and all the N.P.C.s weren't Zoid form. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I guess you had like these <fifty::50> foot tall robots living inside of gigantic medieval castles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Of course, I have no idea what sort of city this takes place in. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is this, like, a futuristic site by type city? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yet the roads don't seem to be paid; it's all dirt and rocks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe Zoids takes place in like a post-apocalyptic world, everything is falling apart. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But everyone has these gigantic metal suits. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So there has to be some like high-tech industrial infrastructure, right? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, in order to build these things, wouldn't that require things like paved roads. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But when you go outside you see all the cities look like vaguely European medieval castles and villages. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe the makers of this game figured 'as an R.P.G. there has to be castles.'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Just like the first oids game random enemies appear on the overworld and then fight them in these first-person shooting sections. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So this is what sets apart a game from other 'Dragon west' clox. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But these battles are [pretty] terrible. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is, sort of, hard to tell in a fire is going to hit you or not. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And when your lasers could enemy they explode like these stupid looking for fluffy pink clouds. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So really, this feels a lot like the first game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe it's a little better. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The graphics are still [pretty] ugly and the music is grading. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe something interesting happens at some point, but from what I played it looks very much like a typical low grade R.P.G.-type game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dengeki Big Bang! 🇯🇵 // Clash at Demonhead 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Bang" ♪ by Rye Rye

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January 27 🇯🇵 // 1990 January [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by VIC TOKAI 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by VIC TOKAI 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Perhaps our big game this episode is "Dengeki Big Bang!" (didn't get the meaning of shock or an electrical shock and bang being the protagonists name). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this was produced by VIC TOKAI and is definitely the biggest most forward-looking game they've released so far. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't know this game is very successful, but it was released in the U.S. under the name "Clash at Demonhead" and develop a [pretty] strong cult following. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Funny it takes place in the year <NINETEEN-NINETY-X::199X>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The future was such a long time ago. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 VIC TOKAI has a tough time squeezing in the English language text, I see. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Right so here we have the old bit where the heroes vacation gets interrupted by a national emergency of some sort. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 No clash it even has a side-scrolling Action Game, but it does have a healthy dose of non-linearity tossed into it for good measure. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The World Map is a series of interconnected paths. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At each juncture, you can choose which path to go down. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once you've made your selection you then proceed down the path and the typical side-scrolling segment, shooting enemies which will occasionally drop the dollar signs which you pick up for cash in order to buy stuff in the store. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Occasionally, you will encounter an N.P.C. and then we'll get these little dialogue screens, which are dubbed talking time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Like this fellow - it's a skeleton dude who turned out to be named get this Tom guy caught. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He's the chief of the governor's. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Tom guy, cod's a really odd name for this character. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, generally guys with skulls for faces have more menacing names that kind of play off their physical appearance like Skeletor or or the Red Skull. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this guy doesn't even call himself Thomas daikon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, Tom sounds so casual for a guy with a skull for a face. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now something else that's very important are the red apples. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When we dropped one, pick it up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now you might think an apple is a health refill. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, make sense; food equals health, right? - at least in video games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nope. It turns out that apples give you eXperience Points, or rather these things that the game calls Force Points, which functions sort of like eXperience Points. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We'll discuss what the Force Points do in just a moment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, when you reach the end of the level, you're back on the World Map and you can choose which path or route you want to take. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is actually a bit confusing; the number refers to the routes between the junctions, not the actual junctions themselves. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The junctions have no name or number or anything; they're just placeholders between the route on a map. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The levels are [pretty] standard affairs, mostly flat ground with the occasional jump or a lake or something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A few levels have a bit more variety. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like, sort of, going because he's still on the surface who almost certainly take damage from injuries firing at you, but if you get below the surface, you will automatically take water damage or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Perhaps part of the game's appeal is the bizarreness of the N.P.C.s. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like this little dude named Michael who shouts a huge "NO!" when you try to shoot him. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then he instantly announces himself as your ally. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sounds a little suspicious to me. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But he does give you a general direction to go - Route <SEVENTEEN::17> - to meet a sprite named Facia. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 They will point out that neither in the game map nor the manual do they actually show you the route numbers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So you really have no idea where Route <SEVENTEEN::17> actually is until you just happen to find it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Clash at Demonhead" requires a lot of wandering around and backtracking, hint is commonly referred to as a Metroidvania game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Paying will be very impressed when he finds this bright who then tells him to meet a hermit - wizard like fellow who can grant him special powers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Looking for the hermit will lead it to the first boss fight with a demon named rowdy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then a cunning twist on standard boss battles to damage him by hitting his feet not jumping up and pulling his head. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This took me a while to figure out the first time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Talking to the hermit will grant you the micro power, you need this to shrink down and exit the little tiny passageway. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And here's where the Force Points comes in. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 On the inventory screen a select the hermit and you'll see the powers that you have. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once you get a certain number of Force Points you will automatically get the next power. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So, as I mentioned, the Force Points do act kind of like experience. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So how do you obtain Force Points? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, there's the very rare apple drops. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And you can also buy an item in the shops called Dyna Punch, but you can [only] buy three at a time and the shop is often sold out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Let's take a look at the shop or super shop as it says. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The shop is normally [only] accessible this one point right here by the lake. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you want to visit the shop again, you need to make sure you buy a call shop item for <TWO-THOUSAND::2,000> bucks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This will allow you to access the shop and other time at any point in the map. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The thing is if you neglect to buy the call shop item, you're [pretty] much screwed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You'll need to go all the way back to this area in order to visit the shop. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the shop, you can buy limited use weapons such as like special equipment. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a jet pack there's the aqua long for breathing underwater. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You need to get this to actually get past some of the underwater passages. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 All this makes "Clash at Demonhead" sound like a [pretty] cool game and in some ways it is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Certain parts are creative like this boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He's a little tiny can't hurt a bit jumps around phonetically anyway. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As you shoot him he gradually grows in size until the next thing you know, he's a full size box setting up little demons to inaccurate. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I definitely not seen anything exactly like this before. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And there was a little bit of Brighton levels, as I mentioned. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like some moments were need to dawn the Aqua along and travel underwater, or at one point introduced the super suit to pass through a pool of lava. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This boss fight starts out with three bikini clad dancing girls tossing bombs at you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then once you get this weird guy who tosses his mushroom hat at you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And VIC TOKAI did try to make the story interesting by adding little twists and turns in the plot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like there are several N.P.C.s you encounter, one of which is your presumed dead coworker. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then your supposedly kidnapped girlfriend Mary, who suddenly turns on you when you try to rescue her. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Turns out she's like a fake. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then Michael, your self described ally turns out to be a douchebag who sends you on a side quest and then later reveals his true colors. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game is [pretty] nonlinear and some stuff is completely optional. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For example, one of the things that you can do is you can go hunting for gold ore. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You'll find it here and there and there's actually a gold mine that you can find where you can pick up tons of it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Then later in the game, you'll find this little shop with this weird chick who actually sell you can sell the gold to her for cash. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still, I was overall, sort of, disappointed with "Clash at Demonhead". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It seems like it has potential but a number of things about it made me feel kind of let down. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Let's, sort of, take a look at some of the problems. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 First off there's Demonhead. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game is called "Clash at Demonhead" but is the word 'Demonhead' even uttered one to this entire game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Does the game ever tell you what Demonhead is? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe an expert on this will prove me wrong but while playing back the video for this segment, I think didn't see anyone ever used the word 'Demonhead'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game does mention the bad guys are putting out a place being called the Devil's Tower, perhaps a reference to the famous Wyoming rock formation. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The manual calls it Demonhead Mountain, however. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The dicta cops had to change the name after completing the localization and then no one bothered to correct it in the actual game itself? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Second, there is boring enemy and level design. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Let's face it; "...Demonhead" system of interconnected paths looks a lot like that a "Bionic Commando". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But while Capcom had some [pretty] amazing level design, "...Demonhead" is just basically straightforward walking and shooting like <NINETY-PERCENT::90%> of the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Compared to something like "Mega Man <TWO::2>" this looks incredibly old-fashioned! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Enemies can be both a boring and annoying. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Many of them fall into the category of the flying enemies which fly at head level and are very hard-to-hit up to shoot at them in mid-jump. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But most artists are like these, sort of, small generic-looking videogame monsters with very few exceptions. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Those exceptions are often very goofy looking - like this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Even many bad games like "Keith Courage..." had more interesting enemy designs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 To make matters worse, the developers actually reused certain areas of the levels at various points throughout the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This part right here appears in several different routes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 People call "Halo (1)" example of cut and paste level design. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But VIC TOKAI was really, sort of, doing the same thing way back when. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And let's take a moment to discuss the so-called Metroidvania elements. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're [pretty] underwhelming. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Like a lot of post "Metroid" N.E.S. games, "...Demonhead" throws in a certain amount of non-linearity, exploration, and R.P.G. elements like getting new abilities as the game progresses, buying things in shops and so on. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But what makes so-called Metroidvania games so appealing is the juxtaposition of gradually increasing powers and gaining access to previously unavailable areas. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And that's the important thing; the game masters show you the existence of these new areas. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Their inaccessibility will tantalize you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You know, later you will come back and you can explore these off limit areas. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This was true in "Metroid", and it's true in games today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This whole pattern of like reaching a dead end, finding a new ability, and then coming back to that dead end later, kind of what seems to define the Metroidvania sub-genre. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I mean, even 'Dragon Quest' tempted you by showing you locked doors with treasure chest right behind them early in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "...Demonhead" doesn't really pull this off. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, yeah, sure you gain new powers in the hermit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the first one micro power is the [only] one that's required to move forward to a new area. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You need the Aqua lums and super suits at various points in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But these can be purchased from the shop at any time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Bang doesn't really grow any more powerful as the game progresses, other than simply getting like bar extensions from the bosses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The one exception is a demon that will instantly kill you if you don't have the Apollo sword. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later you find the sword and then you can defeat the demon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But that's the [only] time the sword is actually useful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not like a permanent power-up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And the demon boss himself is disappointing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He fights like a little tiny flying eyeball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's so lame! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Quite frankly, the fact we have to do a lot of backtracking and exploration come from the fact that the World Map doesn't show the route numbers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If someone says go to Route <THIRTY-THREE::33>, you have to wander randomly find it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As mentioned earlier, the fact that the levels themselves are kind of dull makes all this wandering around, sort of, tiresome. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, it's maybe it's wrong for me to criticize the plot of the game this era. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But really, this doesn't make a lot of sense. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A professor has been a doomsday bomb and has been kidnapped by evil forces. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Okay, fine. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But for some reason, the bomb can [only] be activated by inserting a series of seven medallions. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's a really weird thing to implement in a bomb design. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why not a passcode or something? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, you reach the enemy camp at the top of the mountain, fight a boss (which is not Tom guy by the way; you never find him for some reason). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then you reach the final boss - or so you think. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's actually a bit disappointing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So you need to take out these laser cannons it's quite simple to do this using a special weapon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I think it's actually necessary to use one of the special items in order to actually reach the cannons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still, this is [pretty] quick and simple. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then the baskets up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 All you have to do after this is to the accurate the bomb. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You're running along and along the way you find this alien being that tells you that they created the human race quote unquote, a millennium ago. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Really a millennium? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So mankind was created in the <NINE-HUNDREDS::900s>? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not clear what this alien has to do with anything. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But does he have something to do with the bomb? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, this is the most pointless insertion of an alien being into a plotline until the last 'Indiana Jones' movie. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One to reach the bottom you insert this into medallions, but they have to be in the correct order. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We [only] have so many chances to guess. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If it fail, everything blows up and you die. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If you succeed, the alien has a hissy fit and takes off. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 After saving the world you were reunited with a hermit, girlfriend, and commanding officer, then they all live happily ever after. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Clash at Demonhead" was a game I really wanted to like. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The concept is good but the actual execution doesn't quite pull it off in my opinion. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The actual meat of the game (the side-scrolling segments) are just to pedestrian. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "...Demonhead" definitely has some progressive elements like the optional side stories but overall it doesn't quite rise to the level of some of the recent in the scene like "Bionic Commando", or "Mega Man <TWO::2>", or even "Blaster Master". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still it's a big step up for VIC TOKAI, especially after their last game "Kid Kool". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So not a great game but still an interesting one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Motocross Champion 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Ooh, this looks exciting! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A motocross game from Konami, "Motocross Champion". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well don't get your hopes up too high because this game is merely average. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 [Pretty] cool intro though. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There are two modes: practice and the regular racing mode, which is like a tournament style setup. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the practice mode is to drive around in circles forever in order to learn the tracks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So what are all those blue things? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Tree trunks? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Weird! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well, I'm not off to a good start. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So "Motocross Champion" is a [pretty] average Racing Game with a healthy dose of "ExciteBike" thrown in. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But this is not really an "ExciteBike" clone. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It doesn't really play much like "ExciteBike" for the most part. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But you do have lots of weird "ExciteBike" like ramps everywhere and you can lower or raise your front wheel much like a Nintendo's game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However, in "Motocross Champion", you all seem to steer around the curvy tracks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Can be driving in a completely vertical direction at times. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In that regard it more resembles some of those top-down Racing Games we've been seeing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The main issue is going to be the bikes handling. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's, I guess, as the kids would say nowadays, awkward. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's really easy to run to the edge of the track ball turning or even get stuck on the side of a ramp. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the main mode has you racing against other bikes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And unlike "ExciteBike", this is like a real race. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Need to beat the other drivers in order to win. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's quite easy to hit them and get knocked down however. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Then in September of '89, Konami released a sequel of sorts for the new Game Boy handheld called "Motocross Maniacs". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The mechanics were completely reworked and ended up spawning a few sequels on the Game Boy Color and the Game Boy Advance. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Unlike "Motocross Champions", the Game Boy titles were released outside of Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Motocross Champions" is not really a bad game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not exactly top-tier Konami, but it could be much worse. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you can master the controls to the point where you're not constantly running into the walls, you might find it, sort of, enjoyable. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pachio Kun 2 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by C-Dream | Marionette 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Coconuts Japan 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The end of January is approaching and what do we have here? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why it's "Pachio Kun <TWO::2>" from Coconuts Japan and the mysterious C-Dream - and also the contract developer slash programming company called Marionette. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you go all the way back to "Chrontendo Episode <TWENTY-SIX::26>" and December <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>, you'll recall the greatest week in videogame history. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Within a six day period "Mega Man", "Final Fantasy", "Phantasy Star", "Metal Gear" released. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also "Pachio Kun" keen on the same day as "Final Fantasy". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game is about a giant anthropomorphic Pachinko ball who... 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh Lord! what is going on here? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This game really have to reference the Pachinko ball sex? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We really need to see two living Pachinko balls in bed? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is that really a fetish in Japan? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The girl Pachinko ball even wears like these sexy pink hooker shoes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Right? Well, Pachio Kun loves to play Pachinko and collect his tiny non-sentient brethren. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Just like "Casino Kid"! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Or I guess maybe "Casino Kid" ripped off the first "Pachio Kun" game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, all you really need to know about this game is it's basically a Pachinko game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Pachio Kun goes to the Pachinko parlor and place Pachinko. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Issued ball bearings and chinko machine, balls bounce around a little pigs, lights go off. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sometimes you win more ball bearings; sometimes you don't. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The object is to empty machine out of ball bearings. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This all looks just like the first 'Pachio Kun' grenade. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However, it's not the last 'Pachio Kun' game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are a total of five FamiCom games with 'Pachio Kun'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're also for P.C. Engine 'Pachio Kun' games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I guess this means that I actually finished 'Chrontendo' on 'Chronturbo' I was played a total of nine 'Pachio Kun' games - nine games but a walking talking Pachinko ball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Can someone remind me why I'm doing this again? 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 World Grand Prix: Pole to Finish 🇯🇵 // Al Unser Jr. Turbo Racing 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 January 31 🇯🇵 // 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 //  🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Hey, one last game in January - Data East's "World Grand Prix: Pole to Finish", which is a rather awkward name, especially the 'Pole to Finish' part. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sounds dirty somehow. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The title screen is strangely silent. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, there are a few different modes and a good choice of tracks all around the world. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We'll start with the single lap mode, which is, sort of, a practice mode. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I think in the U.S. version it was called the time trial mode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As we can see, this is a Formula One Racing Game, <F-ONE::F1> being popular all over the world but not so much in the U.S. (rebels that we are). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So "...Pole to Finish" has some kind of crazy eye bleeding background effects. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess the game went all 'Pokemon' and gave kids seizures or something, because this was completely changed for the international releases. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So in <NINETEEN-NINETY::1990>, Data East released it in the U.S. as "Al Unser Jr. Turbo Racing". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Still no music on the title screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This version form the basis of the European version, which is simply called "Turbo Racing". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The options are [pretty] much the same, including the set of international tracks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now this is the second time a Japanese <F-ONE::F1> game was hastily converted into an N.E.S. game featuring a non-F1 driver. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The other was, of course, the Michael Andretti game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Al Unser Jr. was just just like in ready to, sort of, a famous racer, he raced for the U.S. space championship auto racing teams. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The kart autos are similar to the <F-ONE::F1> autos, but tend to be heavier and less focused on taking lots of sharp turns. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Al Unser Jr. ended up winning the Indy <FIVE-HUNDRED::500> a couple times. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's kind of an odd coincidence, but Al Unser Jr. ended up winning his first Indy <FIVE-HUNDRED::500> race after Michael Andretti, who is in the lead had mechanical problems near the very end of the race. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As far as Racing Games go, this is not bad. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have three gears. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The buttons control acceleration and breaks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is one of the time trials here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 All you need to do is simply beat a certain time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The main part of the game however, is the actual Championship Circuit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Hearing the race each track in order. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can choose your name your vehicles color and assign points to the cars attributes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Such R.P.G. elements were actually becoming [pretty] common and Racing Games at the time as people have seen earlier episodes 'Chrontendo' would know. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The bottom attribute looks, sort of, like tab, but it's actually 'T.R.B.' for 'turbo'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So after you set all this up and your race, a qualifying lap. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then the real race begin, which actually features other drivers and multiple laps - perhaps too many laps. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 They will notice the background has been toned down quite a bit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game's display has also been reworked. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's now a shot of a racers face stuffed into the lower left corner. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is completely useless of course. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But you know what would have been helpful instead? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe a map of the track so you can see when tight turns are coming up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Trust me; sudden tight turns will be your nemesis in this game unless you have their locations in the track memorized. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You'll also hate the other cars because hitting them almost always caused you to spin out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though the other car will always be unaffected. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And naturally there is no, sort of, rubber banding and again, that's vintage. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So if you screw up, you'll be hard pressed to catch up with the other cars. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's strange; we see the oil company Valvoline's named are a couple times in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I assume this was some kind of product placement. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But why? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not like kids are going to go out buying motor oil. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And doubling same doesn't actually appear anywhere on the box. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So who knows? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's not really a bad Racing Game by any means. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though, I suppose the fact that you have to race it so many laps on each track does make it a bit tedious. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 41 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍊🍓 The release schedule picks up just a little bit in February, but we're still going to try to squeeze in every game from that month into one episode. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now, should you be looking forward to "...Episode <FORTY-TWO::42>"? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, let's just say we have another game from L.J.N. and a little something called "Hydlide <THREE::3>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yes, you're welcome. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 See ya then. 🍇🍌
