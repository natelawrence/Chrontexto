👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chronturbo Episode 6 ✨


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Hi, and welcome to the inaugural episode of 'Chronturbo', where... 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Hey everyone, it's Dr. Sparkle once again with "...Episode <Six::6>" of 'Chronturbo'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Another <fifteen::15> games from October, November, and December <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We've got some HuCard games, some C.D.-ROM games, some Arcade ports, and some, kind of, actually, sort of, weird stuff. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Parental Advisory ✨


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 One particular game is... just a little... well, you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, maybe... don't let the kids watch this one. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Also, we have one game that [pretty] much every <Turbo-Graphics::TurboGrafx> fan will be familiar with. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Support Dr. Sparkle on Patreon ✨


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And I guess this is, sort of, the soft launch for the 'Chrontendo' Patreon. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I say it's the soft launch because a lot fewer people watch 'Chronturbo' versus 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I've had the Patreon for a while now, but never really told anyone about it - just, sort of, keeping [it] under wraps, except for a few people who just happened to stumble across it. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I wasn't planning on revealing it now, in the middle of a -- a dang pandemic. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But some people have recently signed on, so 'What the heck?'; I guess it's launched as of -- as of right now. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Feel free to send me money. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The feeling of obligation will hopefully make me crank these things out a little bit faster. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Also, I will be reducing the number of games from <fifteen::15> to <ten::10> in future episodes. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 These things are getting too darn long, especially the 'Chrontendo' episodes. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, hopefully, this will, again, speed up production somewhat. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, let's get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Digital Champ: Battle Boxing 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 October 13 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Naxat Soft 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Naxat Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We have a mere five games for the P.C. Engine in October <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 (Well, some might say six games, but we are counting it as five.) 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Don't worry, tons of games will be released in December. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, let's start with "Digital Champ...". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Sort of a terrible name. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, I -- I get it, video games are digital, but still... 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's published by Naxat, who is (if you recall from a couple episodes ago) -- was the second third-party publisher for the P.C. Engine (preceded [only] by Namco). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Naxat's "Alien Crush" came out in September <Eighty-Eight::'88>. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And if you're wondering if this is going to be as good as "Alien Crush", well, I'm sorry to disappoint you. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Digital Champ..." is sort of like the "China Warrior" of Boxing Games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It has impressively large sprites, but little else. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Your first opponent is 'Marciano', obviously named after Rocky Marciano, one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time, and who is designed to look like Sylvester Stallone in this game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Rocky Balboa was, of course, named after Rocky Marciano. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We're sort of muddling together fact and fiction, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Throughout the various 'Chron...' series, we've covered a number of great Boxing Games, such as "Punch-Out!!", and... well, I'm sure there were others. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But "Digital Champ..." is not one of them. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You have [only] three opponents, and each reappears for a second time later in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The controls are nice and simple. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You use the, uh, two buttons to punch. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Left and right buttons correspond to your fists. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Using the D-Pad, you can move around a bit from side to side and punch high or punch low. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The Punch Meter in the lower right fills up when you hold down the punch button. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 If you release it at exactly the right moment, you'll throw a very powerful punch. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But it's really easy to miss, if your opponent is not in exactly the right position. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 If you take a look near the top of the screen, you'll see that both you and your opponent have both Stamina and Energy Meters. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Well, your Stamina is the more temporary of the two. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You lose Stamina when you get hit, and when the bar is empty you get knocked down. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 However, if a boxer still has a good amount of energy left. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 He'll be able to get back up on their feet before being counted out. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This also refills much of their Stamina Bar. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Over the course of a few rounds, the Energy Meter will slowly drop to the point where if you knock down your opponent, he'll stay down. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The boxers don't really have much personality, unlike the fighters in "Knock Out". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, they're just generic boxer dudes. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I don't know that there are really specific strategies for dealing with your opponents, other than trying to hit them a lot. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The fights are kind of long and tiresome, [and] I can't imagine anyone really wanting to play this all the way to the end. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There are a few things I like. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I'm fascinated by the very abstract background - just various rectangles of bluish-white and gray. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It has sort of, like, a camera blur effect. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And the sprites are huge. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Your opponent takes up almost half the screen vertically, and your gloves are gigantic and can scale appropriately as you punch. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You'll even see bruises and blood appear on your opponents, as the fight goes on. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This never got a U.S. release, until it appeared on the Virtual Console many, many years later, in <Two-Thousand-Eight::2008>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, once again, technically impressive, it shows the P.C.E.'s graphical capabilities quite well. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's just not a very entertaining Boxing Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tatsu no Ko Fighter 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 October 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Advance Communications 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Tonkin House 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, what we have here is "Tatsu no Ko Fighter" from Tonkin House - the first Tonkin House game for the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You'll note the Tokyo Shoseki copyright (Tonkin being a division of that publishing company). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, we've seen a few Tonkin House games in 'Chrontendo', most notably "Softball Tengoku" - that weird game that got released in the U.S. as "Dusty Diamond's All-Star Softball". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Aside from that, Tonkin House also published Compile's "Gunnac" for the FamiCom and a couple of the '<Ease::Ys>' sequels. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is apparently developed by Advanced Communication Company, who did quite a few games for Tonkin House. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, I know what you're thinking. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 'Dr. Sparkle, this looks like an anime!' 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Well, it certainly does, now. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 However, "Tatsu no Ko Fighter" is *not* an anime adaptation. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But the characters *were* designed by a manga artist, Akira Miyashita, who's mostly known for 'Sakigake!! Otokojuku', which was one of those comics about super tough juvenile delinquent High School students. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Though the art style in this game is m... -- way more goofy than that comic. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Like this very busty, gapped-tooth, cross-eyed nurse. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 She's the one who refills your health between levels, so we won't bother with her quite yet. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This game never received any sort of release outside of Japan, but is sometimes referred to online as "Dragon Fighter Boy" or just "Dragon Fighter". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, this is not really a pleasant game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And I think we'd categorize this as kusoge. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's a very basic Platformer-type game that'll get on your nerves [pretty] quickly. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Your weapon is a short staff, which is always not quite long enough to reach enemies. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 These jumping spider things, in particular, are really obnoxious. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 A very common enemy type are these weird flying guys with rectangular bodies, who often suddenly appear on the right side of the screen and then smack right into you. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They take multiple hits to kill, so it's hard to avoid taking a bit of damage every time you see one. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, you'll notice your Life Bar is quite long, and various power-ups throughout the game will lengthen it. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, clearly, this game is designed around getting hit on a regular basis. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The jumping is also [pretty] wonky. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's slightly floaty and it's easy to overjump. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The game likes putting spikes below platforms, which not [only] damage you but also cause you to, sort of, helplessly bounce around back and forth - because ya -- suddenly you can't move. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's hard to impossible to jump back onto a small platform if you hit the spikes, so more than likely you'll die. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The whole thing feels sort of, like, uh, "Ninja Gaiden"-y, but with much less tighter controls and much sloppier level design and just loves throwing all kinds of shit at you, willy-nilly. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's a mini-boss here, this staff-wielding pig. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Defeating him will allow you to go forward to fight the real boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And here's the weird thing: Whenever you fight the end of the level boss, you will suddenly transform into, like, this big shirtless guy. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 He doesn't really have any special abilities, other than being large. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 By the way, you probably noticed the Magic Meter, down at the bottom. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You can switch from the staff to magical weapons, like I'm doing, here. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You then return to your hometown and can purchase Health and Magic Refills, and so it goes. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, you know, while this game isn't very good (obviously), it is, [in fact], the kind of stuff I like to see when I'm doing these videos. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 These forgotten little genre games that Japanese kids had to suffer through, decades ago... I mean, some of them are kind of cute and charming. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I really hate having to actually play them, but I do have a, sort of, a, uh -- a certain appreciation for this particular art form. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kagami no Kuni no Legend 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 October 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Mutech 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Victor Musical Industries 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We have four C.D.-ROM-ROM games this time, and three of them came out on the same day, October <Twenty-Seventh::27th>, <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Though we will be covering the other two just as one single game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You'll see why in a moment. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, first up: from Victor, it's "Kagami no Kuni no Legend". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The word 'kagami' doesn't have an exact English equivalent, but it's usually translated as 'country'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, the title would be 'Mirror Country Legend' or maybe 'Legend of the Mirror Country'. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, there's an in-game manual, which is [pretty] uncommon at the time, in which, via the power of C.D.-ROM technology, you'll get spoken instructions on the controls and such. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's also this musical intro, which again uses the C.D. audio, so this sounds quite good (or at least as good as a piece of generic, uh, J-Pop can sound). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Obviously, this will remind you of "No-Ri-Ko" (the C.D.-ROM-ROM release from Hudson, in which you romance the J-Pop singer, Noriko) and, in fact, yeah, this is clearly not Noriko, as we can see by looking at the game's cover. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You see, Hudson's game featured an <Eighties::'80s> Pop Idol named Noriko Ogawa - and this game uses <Eighties::'80s> Pop Idol, Noriko Sakai, who actually had a much more successful career than the other Noriko, releasing countless albums and acting in several popular T.V. dramas. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 She was quite popular in Japan, uh, as well as Taiwan, China, {and} South Korea. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Her career came to a sudden halt when she was arrested for drug use in <Two-Thousand-Nine::2009>, when police found less than <one-one-hundredth::1/100th> of a gram of 'stimulant'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 If that's cocaine, we're talking, like, <fifteen::15> bucks worth of coke. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And if it was meth, then that's, like, less than a dollar's worth. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You can't even get high on that much meth. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Anyway, Victor not [only] dropped her; they discontinued her C.D.s, the chairman of the talent agency that represented Sakai resigned. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It was a huge scandal for an absurdly small amount of drugs. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Anyway, Noriko gets zapped into another dimension, and you have to save her. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The game itself is a [pretty] goofy Adventure Game with nice clean-looking graphics and lots of voice acting. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You play this just like you do any other Japanese Menu-Based Adventure Game: interact with various N.P.C.s, look around at various locations, ... 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Essentially, you're just kind of looking for the trigger to unlock the next section of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And there are mirrors, here. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They seem to play an important part of the game, hence the title, 'Legend of Mirror Country'. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You can lose the game by making the wrong choice, and Noriko gets [pretty] upset about this. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Canopy canopy canopy canopy canopy". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "What happened to her shirt?", I wonder. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, not exactly a game that's going to thrill most people, but it looks charming, the characters display a certain amount of creativity, the artwork is quite competent, it doesn't seem that bad. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Mommy's gonna lie on." 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 ROM² Karaoke Vol. 1 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 October 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: NEC Avenue 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Let's fire up the old C.D.-ROM-ROM once again, and this is another non-game title, "ROM-ROM Karaoke". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Volume <One::1> and <Two::2> were released on the same day, and there's really not that much to interest us, here. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, we're going to cover them together as one title. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 When we load this thing up, we get a menu of songs to choose from - just standard Japanese pop songs. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Unless you're some sort of Japanese Pop-Rock music aficionado, you probably won't recognize any of these songs or artists. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But, uh, most of these guys were reasonably well-known, at the time, such as June Skywalker, Hound Dog, The Blue Hearts, Shizuka Kudo, Wink, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As for Volume <Two::2>, it's [pretty] much exactly the same. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In fact, the title screen for Volume <Two::2> is the exact same screen as Volume <One::1>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And I mean, it's identical. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It actually says 'Volume <One::1>'; they somehow forgot to change it to 'Volume <Two::2>' for this. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, there's a lot of confusion between N.E.C.'s 'ROM-ROM Karaoke' series (the one we're watching now) and Victor's 'ROM-ROM Karaoke' series. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, yes, both are in fact titled 'ROM-ROM Karaoke', 'Volume <One::1>', 'Volume <Two::2>', et cetera. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Each had five volumes. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 These Karaoke Discs are [pretty] poorly documented online. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Even Japanese Wikipedia doesn't list all of them in their mostly-complete page on P.C. Engine games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Several sites, like GameFAQs, seem to conflate the two separate series, listing both N.E.C.'s and Victor's name in the description. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And numerous sites give no release data for them at all, or switch around the release dates of the N.E.C. with the Victor games and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I'm not even <one-hundred percent::100%> sure the dates that I have are correct. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Anyway, you can look forward to another eight discs of Karaoke in future episodes of 'Chronturbo'. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Doraemon: Meikyū Daisakusen 🇯🇵 // Cratermaze 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 October 31 🇯🇵 // 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Hey, it's Doraemon, the beloved robot cat from the future. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is one of three Hudson-published games today, two of which got U.S. releases on the <Turbo-Graphics-Sixteen::TurboGrafx-16>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 One of these games is actually probably one of the most well-known and well-regarded <Turbo-Graphics::TurboGrafx> games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We'll get to that one a bit later. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But first, let's take a look at this cutesy little 'Doraemon' Puzzle Game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The intro is quite nice. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And the music (as you kids like to say) slaps! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, some sort of dobu statue dude kidnaps Doraemon's friends, and our heroic robot cat needs to rescue them. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The game has a series of little mazes that you need to navigate, in order to collect those steaming hamburgers. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Are those the, uh -- the steamed hams that we've heard so much about? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Well, actually, they are dorayaki, which are little Japanese pastry things (basically two pancakes with some sweet bean paste in the middle) which just happen to be Doraemon's favorite food. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Little monsters will chase you around. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is sorta like "Lode Runner", actually. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You can dig holes, which the monsters will fall into. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And then Doraemon can... 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Well, there's really no way to sugarcoat this. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Japan's most beloved robot cat will stand over the helpless creature and murder them. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's not even any skin or flesh left when he's done with his victims. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They do get a Christian burial. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Once you've pillaged all the food in this little town and decimated its population, this key will appear, which will unlock Doraemon's magical door thing. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Then you go off to the next level. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 (And yes, you do get extra points for killing those guys.) 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And this is not the end of the story, though! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's a twist. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In <Nineteen-Ninety::1990>, Hudson released this in the U.S. under the name "Cratermaze". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 All really obvious 'Doraemon' references were removed, but the intro is still [pretty] great. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 For the most part, though, the game is unchanged. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The Dorayaki have been replaced with little treasure chests. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, on Normal difficulty, this is [pretty] easy (something little kids could easily handle). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As you go through the game, the mazes get a bit more 'mazy'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 More aggressive enemies appear, more power-ups are added. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It actually gets quite a bit more difficult, as you go through the game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, if this looks sort of familiar, well, yeah, we actually more or less have seen this before - for the Nintendo Entertainment System. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The roots go all the way back to an old Computer game, called "Heiankyo Alien" ('Heiankyo' being the capital of Japan, back in the 'Heian' period - the city is now called Kyoto). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In <Nineteen-Eighty::1980>, the electronics company, Denki Onkyo, released an Arcade version. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Incidentally, this Denki Onkyo is not related to the more famous electronics company, Denki Onkyo (now known as Denon). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And neither are they related to the other Japanese electronics company, Onkyo. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In this game, you play as a cop who is stopping an alien invasion by digging holes in the ground for the aliens to fall into. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Heiankyo Alien" was endlessly copied by other companies, including Sega and Taito (the late <Seventies::'70s> and early <Eighties::'80s> being sort of like the -- the Wild West era of video games). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In <Nineteen-Eighty-Seven::1987>, Nichibutsu released a rather sophisticated clone of "Heiankyo Alien" called "Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Some sources suggest this was an officially-licensed "Heiankyo..." clone, but I haven't really found any evidence to support this. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Denki Onkyo's name doesn't appear anywhere on the game, and a heavily revised port appeared on the FamiCom, under the rather baffling name "Booby Kids" a little bit later in <Nineteen-Eighty-Seven::1987>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We covered it in 'Chrontendo' many, many years ago. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, this is far from being the [only] other "Heiankyo Alien"-inspired game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You might remember, uh, "Boomer's Adventure in Asmik World" for the Game Boy and, for some damn reason, Meldac (the Japanese record label) released a port of the original "Heiankyo Alien" game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, with all that in mind, how is "Cratermaze"? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, it's fun. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It more closely resembles the Arcade game than "Booby Kids" does. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It has the same, sort of, like, vertical layout as "Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen" and the enemy sprites are virtually the same as well. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The Japanese and American versions are [pretty] much the same (other than swapping out a few sprites). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Though, if you play the Japanese game, you will get the forbidden thrill of having Doraemon kill cops. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I guess Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics do not apply to Doraemon. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, anyway, my final verdict is, uh, this is recommended, I suppose. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tsuru Teruto no Jissen Kabushiki Bi-Game 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 November 10 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Tose 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Intec 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Let's kick off November with "Tsuru Teruto no Jissen ... Bi-Game". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And boy! This is a tough one! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Everything about it is just draped in mystery and obscurity. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The title translates roughly to 'Tsuru Teruto's Fighting Stocks Buy-Buy Game'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is a Stock Market Simulation Game - sorta like "Wall Street Kid", maybe. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But without the elements like buying houses, and having a girlfriend, and so on. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As far as I can tell, the entire game is devoted purely to buying and selling stocks. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I'm guessing this fellow here is Tsuru Teruto. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, it's not even clear when this game was released. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Various sources say November <First::1st>, November <Third::3rd>, and November <Eleventh::11th>. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 One thing we might wonder: 'Who exactly is Tsuru Teruto?'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Well, the answer: 'I have no idea.'. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Was he a real person? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Some kind of corporate mascot? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 {I'm} not sure, but there were a few books that came out, with his name on it, in the <Eighties::'80s>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Maybe he was some kind of financial guru-type guy? 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This one was published by Tacoma? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As for this book, it was apparently released in <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988>, one year before the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, this is the first game we've encountered published by Intec, who went on to release several more video games over the next few years. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The development was supposedly handled by Tose, which makes sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, the question is, 'Who is Intec?'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 That's not a name we've encountered before in 'Chrontendo' or 'Chronsega'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And to make matters more confusing, there are a number of unrelated companies called 'Intec'. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, you might think, 'Hey, I've seen the name Intec before. It's on these branded game controllers.'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I've also seen weird stuff like this PlayStation <Two::2> game screen, or this controller with a screen built-in. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 However, the Intec logo is completely different, and the address is in Florida, so it's probably a completely unrelated company. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, as it turns out, Intec has been around since <Nineteen-Sixty-Four::1964>, and is still around today. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The name 'Intec' is short for 'Information Technology', and they are located in Toyama. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Looking them up, we find... this is their headquarters!? 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They are apparently a reasonably serious I.T. company. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The corporate parent company T.I.S. Intec has around <twenty-five-thousand::25,000> employees and, for some reason, published P.C. Engine and Super FamiCom games for several years. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I was kind of assuming that Intec was some fly-by-night publisher who disappeared quickly, but no, these guys are legit. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And confusingly, there is another company called 'Intec' that worked on some PlayStation games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This Intec, I believe, is actually short for 'International Technics'. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, what about the game itself? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Well, what we've seen here is about all there is. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There are two game modes - the main one apparently being the 'Buy! Buy!' mode. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And this is the whole game, um, looking at screens of stock performance, and then buying and selling to make money. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I'm assuming that the, uh -- the mechanics here are a bit more sophisticated than "Wall Street Kid", but it's basically a very stripped-down Stock Market Simulation Game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Thus, the game itself will be of very little interest to most people, including retro game enthusiasts in Japan, since this does not seem to have any kind of cult following, as far as I can tell. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Neutopia 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 November 17 🇯🇵 // 1990 April 15 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Alright, another Hudson game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And unlike "Cratermaze", this time it's an original title. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Though when I say 'original', I mean that it's not officially a port of another property or a remake. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It is not, however, original in the sense that "Neutopia" is one of the most blatant imitations of another game that we've seen in any of the 'Chron...' series. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, "Neutopia" (or, since Japanese game companies have a fascination with a German names, this might be pronounced 'Noitopia') is, in many ways, a very high-quality game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The graphics are bright, simple, colorful, the cutscenes are nicely animated, the music is pleasant, it doesn't have any huge, obvious, glaring bugs. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, it's a, you know -- a nice game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Hudson and N.E.C. released this in the U.S. sometime in <Nineteen-Ninety::1990>, where it became one of the more popular titles for the <Turbo-Graphics-Sixteen::TurboGrafx-16>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You play as Jazeta, who just looks like some dumb kid, but is decked out in a full suit of armor. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 {It} turns out a guy named Dirth had kidnapped the Princess Aurora and has, sort of, sent out his hordes of monsters into the world of "Neutopia". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Also Dirth has stolen a bunch of medallions and hidden them inside various dungeons. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Oh, and, by the way, in the Japanese version, Dirth's name was Raphael. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, luckily there are various people living in caves who help you by healing you, giving you hints, or giving you items - such as the Boom Bombs and the Medicine of Vitality, which refills your health. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, obviously, "Neutopia" is *very* similar to the first "...Legend of Zelda" game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, we all like to throw around the terms like '"...Zelda..." clone' or '"Dragon Quest" clone'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But the thing about "Neutopia" is -- is the extent to which it copies "...Zelda..." exactly in so many ways, right down to the small details. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Obviously, the overall pattern of the game is similar to "...Zelda...". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You explore the [overworld] until you find [a] dungeon. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Each dungeon is a series of interconnected rooms laid out in a grid (typically filled with monsters). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Dungeons contain helpful items. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, at the end of each dungeon, you fight a large boss that moves around in a certain pattern, but always has, like, some kind of Weak Spot that you need to hit. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Defeating the boss gives you another medallion. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You then repeat with the next dungeon. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Along the way you get Life Bar extensions, better swords, and various other helpful artifacts. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 After you defeated the -- the final dungeon, you then go on to fight the final boss and rescue the Princess. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, of course, a lot of games rely on certain established blueprints. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In J.R.P.G.s, you wander around the overworld and go into a town and buy Weapons and Armor. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Then you go into a dungeon and fight a boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The unusual thing about "Neutopia" is how it lifts so many little details directly from "...Zelda...", like the bombs. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You get a supply of bombs and you can use them to blow up holes in suspicious-looking walls on the overworld. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And you can find hidden rooms in the dungeons using bombs - exactly like in "...Zelda...". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You can also burn down trees to find hidden staircases leading underground. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, as for the dungeons, I mean, they are *exactly* like "...Zelda..."'s dungeons - right down to the perspective used with the dramatically foreshortened walls. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Just like in "...Zelda..." there are hidden rooms full of goodies; there are little rocks that you need to push around to unlock hidden exits. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Enemies here also feel very similar to "...Zelda..."'s enemies. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Combat, uh, is virtually identical in the two games, right down to the shield that you carry, which you can use to deflect enemy projectiles. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Many of the items that you find, which you need to make progress in the game, have exact analogues in "...Zelda...", like the 'Rainbow Bridge', which is just 'Zelda's Ladder', but rainbow-colored. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Enemies sometimes drop coins, which you can use to buy potions, bombs, and so on. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Even Jazeta's pose when he finds a new item is just like Link's. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, there are some differences; in some ways, "Neutopia" has been simplified a bit. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 First of all, instead of one big overworld with different areas, there are now four smaller worlds, each with two dungeons. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Each world is exactly eight screens by eight screens in size. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They consist of a Land Sphere world, a Sea Sphere, a Subterranean Sphere, and finally a Sky Sphere. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, unlike "...Zelda...", there are no keys in "Neutopia" - well, with one exception. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The boss area of each dungeon is locked and you need to find the key, which is hidden somewhere in the dungeon. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 For the most part, "Neutopia" feels a bit bland compared to "...Zelda...". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The overworld areas are a bit more generic. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "...Zelda..." had forests, mountains, the creep cemetery, whereas in the four worlds in "Neutopia", there's really not a whole lot of variety between them, other than having, sort of, changed the colors and textures in each world. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, there are some things I like, such as Jazeta's magic wand, which becomes extremely overpowered once you've gotten the full Life Bar. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It just shoots walls of fire, destroying everything in your path. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, this boss (the one in the last dungeon) is the hardest in the game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's actually tougher than Dirth - who's, like, the real final boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Once you've got the eighth piece of the medallion, you need to find the final most powerful sword. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In the last dungeon, you hopefully collect an item called 'The Bell of the Sky'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You can use this to transport you to the location of the last sword. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And I believe you actually do need this sword. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You can't do any damage to Dirth if you haven't found this. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, at this point, you can return to the temple where you first started. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This links up all four worlds. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And it turns out Dirth is just hanging out like in the back room of the temple. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The temple lady unlocks this door and ya just waltz down the hallway. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Well, I suppose technically you teleport, but it's kind of funny that you could have gone straight to him in the very beginning if that lady had just unlocked the door. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The battle against Dirth is not that hard. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 If you have two Health Refill potions, you can just cheese your way through the fight by concentrating on hitting him as many times as possible, and not really worrying about getting hit. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 He just, sort of, melts and then the Princess waltzes out and says... she loves you. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Interestingly, in the game's intro, the temple Guardian straight-up promises you the Princess as a reward for defeating Dirth. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I guess Aurora is a more pragmatic lady than -- than Peach. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Princess Peach would never stoop to marrying a smelly Brooklyn plumber, but Aurora, you know, she knows what she has to do. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And that's "Neutopia"! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's not bad; it's just amazingly unoriginal. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's rare to see a game model itself so closely to another game (and to borrow so many elements without even trying to disguise it)! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, yeah, you can compare '...Mario' to 'Alex Kidd'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, obviously, it was inspired by '...Mario', but they're very distinct games, but "Neutopia" -- it's like the "...Great Giana Sisters" of "...Zelda...". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In some ways, it feels a bit smoother than "...Zelda...", but it's also a bit duller, a bit more repetitive, it lacks "...Zelda..."'s character. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, unfortunately for "Neutopia", one month later another Fantasy Action Adventure Game was released on the P.C. Engine, which proceeded to kick "Neutopia"'s dick into the dirt. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But that's a story for another time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Daichikun Crisis: Do Natural 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 November 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Mint 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Salio 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 November <Twenty-Second::22nd>, and here's a weird one: "Daichikun Crisis...", published by Salio, a name we've encountered before but which you might not remember. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, the game's story is that these cow farmers get a visit from an apparently Good Fairy-type lad named Yarin, who turns out to be an evil witch who makes volcanoes appear everywhere and then turns loose her armies of monsters. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, the cows and their bear friend need to take the land back. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's a bit more to it than that, but it's really not important. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Daichikun Crisis..." is actually [pretty] interesting for a few reasons. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 One of them is the publisher, Salio. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The name might not ring a bell, but we've encountered them before, in 'Chronsega'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Salio is sometimes described as being <quote-unquote mysterious::"mysterious"> since we don't really know anything about them. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They [only] released a total of three games (which isn't that strange by itself) but two of them were Sega Master System ports of Tecmo games ("Rygar" and "Solomon's Key"). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, possibly Salio is some sort of front company for Tecmo. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But that doesn't really explain "Daichikun Crisis...", which has no connection at all to Tecmo, as far as I know. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Also some online sources state that "Fish <~Boy~::{Dude}>" (which is a very rare Game Boy title) was developed by Salio. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But it's not really clear where this information came from, or if it's actually accurate. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, the developer listed on this was Mint - a company mostly known for sound work, including some well-known games that you've heard of, like Hot-B's "Blue Marlin" or, uh, "Wonder Project J". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Though, when it comes to this particular game, it's not really clear, like, in which capacity they actually worked on it (just the sound or something else). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, the other interesting thing about "Daichikun Crisis..." is that it's, sort of, an ancestor to the Farming Simulation Game (you know, stuff like "Harvest Moon" or "Stardew Valley"). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The -- The gameplay, itself, is sort of odd. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You start off near your little house with some tomato and corn seeds. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You then need to plant the seeds and pick them up when they're ripe. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You also need to do a bit of improvement to the ground. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 All the volcanoes in the area are not good for your crops. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And those little gray fuzzballs on the ground represent volcanic ash. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You need to clean up the ash before you can plant anything. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And you do this just like you plant; you walk up to a piece of volcanic ash and then press a button. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Then keep repeating this for every game tile. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Luckily, your family and your bear friend follow you around and will automatically start cleaning up the ash along with you. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, all [of] this sounds very simple, but hordes of monsters descend upon you (not [only] spreading more ash around, but also physically attacking you). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, again, your family will jump in and help you, but you and your family will take damage and can be killed, so you can't be too careless when fighting monsters. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, the obvious question here is, 'Why is this game about Farmer Cows?'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, why Cows fighting Demons instead of, like, normal video game Humans? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Well, the backstory behind "Daichikun Crisis..." is actually kind of interesting! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Um... So, I guess that's actually three interesting things I've mentioned about this game, so far. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 That's probably a 'Chronturbo' record. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The cow family originally appeared on Japanese T.V.. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, there was this children's T.V. show called 'The PaoPao Channel', which would broadcast a short musical segment at the end of every episode. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This <ten::10>-minute segment, called 'Pika Pika Music Hall', was hosted by a sunglass-wearing duck, called Pukumbu. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And among the various characters that appeared was a cow named Katano. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 One particular song about farm cows, titled "Yarin Soren Hokkaido", became quite popular (I have no idea why). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Anyway, the network, T.V. Asahi, licensed out the cow's image for things like dolls and video games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 That explains why there is a credit to T.V. Asahi on the game's title screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, going back to the game, there are a few other elements, aside from fighting monsters and planting crops. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You have a machine which quickly removes ash, and can also dig channels from water sources (basically cutting rivers into the landscape). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And this machine is called the... Geiger Counter? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 While the Geiger Counter is very handy, you can't leave it unattended; otherwise, monsters will come and destroy it. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 A few times a year, there's a festival of some sort at the seaport, where you can sell your crops and buy different types of seeds (such as tree seeds), as well as healing items and upgrades for the Geiger Counter. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Time passes [pretty] quick in this game, so you can actually do your trading on a frequent basis. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Trees are important. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Once mature, they permanently stop volcanic ash from settling in on those spaces. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, your ultimate goal is to plant a lot of trees, which will allow you to fight the boss of the island. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Once he is defeated, you will then move on to the next boss of the game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And there's seven islands altogether. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Daichikun Crisis..." actually got a positive score from Famitsu, <thirty-two::32> out of <forty::40>, which was in fact a [pretty] good score back when Famitsu was really harsh in its reviews. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It scored higher than "Mother" or "Castlevania <Three::III>". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Let's just think about that for a moment. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 However, some years later, Japanese fans rediscovered it, and it got labeled as a kusoge game by some. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Its profile was raised a bit when it appeared in the first volume of this series of books on old forgotten bad games, along with the likes of "Toilet Kids" for the P.C. Engine and "Mystical Fighter" for the Mega Drive. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Playing it now, it's fascinating - even if it does feel very button-pressy. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You are constantly planting seeds and then harvesting the crops. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And when you're not doing this, you're fighting monsters, or you're using the Geiger Counter, or picking up ash - all of which requires pressing a button for every single step you take. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It feels very repetitive, and I'm sure there are some strategies that, when utilized, will make things easier for you. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 For example, digging a river will create a barrier between your land and the volcanic area, thus slowing down the monster attacks. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This sort of reminds me of the Computer game "Populous" more than anything else (the way it divides your attention between building and fighting off enemies). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's a shame this has never received an English translation, since it is actually unlike anything else we've seen on the P.C. Engine, so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jack Nicklaus Championship Golf 🇯🇵 // Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 November 24 🇯🇵 // 1990 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Sculptured Software | Beam | Advance 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Victor Musical Industries 🇯🇵 // Accolade 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Three games came out on November <Twenty-Fourth::24th>, and they're all terrible. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 First up is "Jack Nicklaus' Greatest <Eighteen::18> Holes of Championship Golf", which is quite an awkward title. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 One weird thing is: If you don't hit the Run button [pretty] quickly after starting up, you'll get stuck in this demo mode, which I couldn't seem to get out of other than just by resetting the console. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 One of his favorite finishing holes, if you know what he means. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Alright, so you have quite a few options, here. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You choose the number of players, skill level, whether you want your character to be male or female, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, this looks like most Golf Video Games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It shows you the distance to the tee, the wind direction and intensity. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You choose your club, aim, and then use the Power Meter on the left to control how hard you hit the ball. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Just like [pretty] much every single one of the many, many Golf Games we've covered in the 'Chron...' series, it uses a double pressing of the A button to swing the club. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 One very nice feature, not seen in most Golf Games we've covered, is the fact that it shows you the range of the selected club, right below the club name. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 That's a helpful tool for choosing the club. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, we can't blame this game's weird title on the Japanese developers, because this is a port of an American Computer game, first released in <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "...Greatest <Eighteen::18> Holes..." was released on [pretty] much every platform known to man. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As far as I can tell, the original version was for DOS, but it was soon ported to the Commodore <Sixty-Four::64>, the Amiga, the ST, the CPC, the Apple, the Mac, various Japanese computers, and the N.E.S. (which we'll cover eventually in 'Chrontendo', a few episodes down the road). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Jack Nicklaus was one of the greatest golfers of all time, maybe *the* greatest, winning a total of <eighteen::18> major championships between <Nineteen-Sixty-Two::1962> and <Nineteen-Eighty-Six::1986>, compared to runner-up Tiger Woods at <fifteen::15> championships. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And Woods and Nicklaus were among the five golfers to win all four major championships. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "...<Eighteen::18> Greatest Holes..." was developed by Sculptured Software, a Salt Lake City-based company that specialized in Sports and Wrestling Games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It was first published by Accolade, and its success led to several sequels throughout the <Nineteen-Nineties::1990s>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Beam Software (that infamous Australian company behind such Nintendo Entertainment System games as "Airwolf", "Back to the Future", and "Three Stooges") is apparently responsible for porting this. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Though, the sound was programmed by the also-infamous Japanese developer, Advanced Communications (the guys behind the "Jekyll and Hyde" game for the N.E.S.). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In <Nineteen-Ninety::1990>, Acclaim released it on the <Turbo-Graphics-Sixteen::TurboGrafx-16> in the U.S., under the name "Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They also re-did the title screens and menus, for some reason. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, that I think about it, is this the first game we've seen published by Accolade? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They would, of course, go on to many great things on Nintendo platforms. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "...<Eighteen::18> Greatest Holes..." is not super easy to play. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 For some reason, I always get a crazy slice on the green. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's hard to interpret the topography of the ground. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Most Golf Games map out the hills and valleys of the green. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And if this game does that, then it's not in a way that's clear to me. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's also not the prettiest Golf Game we played, so far. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But the colors are nice and bright, the music is chill as all hell, and it is a very accurate port. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Obviously, we've covered a lot of Golf Games in this series, and this is certainly not the best - but, you know, it's not really the worst either. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mahjong Gakuen - Higashi Kan Shuu Shirou Toujou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 November 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Sakindo 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Face 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Alright folks, we all knew this day would come. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This segment contains brief moments of adult content. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 If you are under <Eighteen::18> (or just generally unfamiliar with the facts of life) please keep your eyes closed during this section. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 If you end up going down the path of vice and perversion, and end up dead in a gutter because you watched this video, don't blame me. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You have been warned. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, here we have "Mahjong Gakuen: Higashi Kan Shuu Shirou Toujou" or "Mahjong Academy", as the title screen says. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And this is the third game we've seen from the publisher, Face. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And apparently partially developed by the mysterious Sankendo and Arc System Works. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, despite this thing being a Mahjong Game, there is some interesting stuff about this game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Every once in a while, I can be somewhat useful during the course [of this] series. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And there's not a whole lot of info on this game in English. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, this should be somewhat informative. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's two modes here... which are very different. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In the first, you square off against a series of young female students, and your ultimate objective is to... get them to take their clothes off. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As you win rounds, the girls begin to undress. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, this is not a new concept in video games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Adult Games like this were [pretty] common in Japanese Arcades. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 At the beginning you [get] introduced to some girls, and as you progress through the game, you're rewarded with illustrations of them getting progressively more nude. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In fact, "Mahjong Academy" is a port of an Arcade game (the second in the series). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Let's take a closer look. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, the original "Mahjong Academy" was released for Arcades in <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988>, published by 'YUGA'! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The idea is simple. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You challenge these schoolgirls to rounds of Mahjong, and they take off their clothes. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's [pretty] dirty! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 However, when you watch this, you might be thinking, 'Huh! This art looks really good for some cheap porn game manufactured by these 'YUGA' guys (whoever they are).'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Well, as far as I can tell, YUGA was basically Capcom's side hustle. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They published the stuff that Capcom didn't want their name on. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The sequel, "Mahjong Academy: Revenge of the Counselor", is copyrighted to Face. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, I'm not sure how or why the rights to this switched from YUGA to Face, but it's still high-quality stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The music on these games is, I believe, by Tamayo Kawamoto of the band Zuntata. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And I think maybe Yoko Shimomura was also involved. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, anyway, the game we're playing today seems to be a significantly altered port of the second "Mahjong Academy" Arcade game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, as far as I know, this was the first officially-licensed aboveground Adult Game to be released for a video game console. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There were certainly lots of unlicensed dirty games, going all the way back to "Custer's Revenge", or the many unlicensed FamiCom carts, but "Mahjong Academy" was <one-hundred percent::100%> aboveground. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 N.E.C. even put it in its magazine ads. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There it is, right along with "Fire Pro Wrestling...". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The gameplay isn't quite realistic Mahjong. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You have various special moves and such (like when the tile catches on fire - I'm sure that's good). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, aside from rounds against the students, you also play male teachers, but this involves punching them in the face. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, there's no way I can beat a Mahjong Game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, I'll show you some video footage of the spicy content (just to satisfy your curiosity of course). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Winning rounds convinces the girls to remove their clothes bit by bit, finally culminating in topless shots of the girls. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 [This is] certainly the first time we've seen nude women portrayed in such a clearly lascivious fashion. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, there is one hilarious feature in this game; it has a panic button. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 If, at any point, you hit the Select button, a screen pops up. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, if someone, like, starts to walk in while you're playing, it'll look like a screen from "Dragon Quest" or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, aside from the main game, there's a straightforward story mode in which you play Mahjong against a bunch of regional champions, in order to become the Mahjong champion of Japan. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But this is just regular straight Mahjong, and I'm not even sure why this is included, as it has nothing to do with the main game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Mahjong Academy" was apparently somewhat controversial. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Famitsu seems to have protested against the game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The original version came with a V.H.S. tape, and I couldn't find any footage from it online. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And I guess a complete copy of the original release of this game is [pretty] expensive now. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Due to the criticism of the game's content, Face re-released it in <Nineteen-Ninety::1990> with all the nudity removed, under the name "Mahjong Academy: Mild". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Also, supposedly there was a soundtrack album, but I couldn't find out much info about that. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, that's one Mahjong Game out of the way. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Next up: another Mahjong Game! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gyuwanburā Jiko Chūshin Ha: Gekitō Sanjūroku Janshi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 November 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Game Arts 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I know I have a lot of fans of Mahjong Games who watch this series. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, guess what, guys? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We have another Mahjong Game for you. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And this one's a C.D.-ROM game! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, we are just totally out in the weeds when it comes to C.D.-ROM titles, this episode. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's a -- a Pop Singer Game, a Karaoke Disc, and now a Mahjong Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, "Gyuwanburā Jiko Chūshin Ha: Gekitō Sanjūroku Janshi" is, yes, based on a manga (of course). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The title means approximately 'Gambler Self-Centered School' or 'Gambler Selfish Style'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And the main character is this sketchy-looking chain-smoking Mahjong player who always wears sunglasses. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 His name, Mochisugi Dorao, means something like 'Too Much Dora' ('dora' being a tile that, when added on to a Mahjong hand, will increase the value of the hand). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The original manga series is sort of weird. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It was written and drawn by Masayuki Katayama and it was published in 'Weekly Young Magazine' (one of those mags aimed at a slightly older audience, which often featured scantily-clad young women on the cover). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In the, uh, lower left corner of this <Nineteen-Eighty-Four::1984> issue, we see it, uh, listed along with 'Bebop High School' and 'Akira'! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It started in <Nineteen-Eighty-Two::1982> and... no one seems to remember when it ended. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Even Japanese Wikipedia says it just ran into the <quote-unquote Nineteen-Eighties::"1980s">. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The comics have never been translated into English and there was never an anime adaptation. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This (and the fact that it's about Mahjong) explains [why] it's virtually unknown in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 However, 'Gambler Jiko' video games were released for multiple platforms. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And these seem to be almost more well-known today than the comic itself was. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And I'm sure, as you recall, we've already seen one of these games before. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, this is the second 'Gambler Jiko' game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The very first title was released on the M.S.X. in <Nineteen-Eighty-Seven::1987>, and then a FamiCom port hit the streets in November <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989> (almost exactly a year before the release of this P.C. Engine version). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Masayuki Katayama is still active today, as far as I can tell, and has done lots of other comics - most of which seem to be based on Mahjong (some serious and then others like, uh, 'Gambler Jiko' are humorous). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, despite its rather niche appeal, uh, wacky Mahjong comics (which often feature like players using all sorts of ridiculous and impossible rules) is still somewhat a popular genre, to this day. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I believe this is just a very enhanced port of the first game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There are a lot more characters (<thirty-six::36> to choose from, instead of <twelve::12>), everything is nicely animated, there's better sound. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's absolutely nothing wrong with this in terms of presentation. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 My [only] complaint is that it's a damn Mahjong Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But, you know, at least the ladies keep their clothes on in this one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Bari Bari Densetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 November 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Our first game of November <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>, "Bari Bari Densetsu" from Taito. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's a [pretty] sweet intro, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, "Bari Bari Densetsu" is a motorcycle Racing Game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And the game's title is usually referred to as 'Motorcycle Legend' in English ('bari bari' being a Japanese phrase, which suggests a crunching or crackling noise). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In this case, I believe it is used to mean, like, 'charged full of energy' - like 'crackling with electricity'. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 My notes indicate that the game is also referred to in English as 'Gun Boy'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The main character's name is Gun Koma, so I guess it's based on that. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But I couldn't find anyone actually referring to this as 'Gun Boy', so who knows where I got that from? 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Quite honestly, "Bari Bari Densetsu" is a [pretty] generic Racing Game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 However, this is based on a licensed property - an <Eighties::'80s> manga from Shuichi Shigeno, who later went on to write and draw the more successful car-racing comic, 'Initial D' (which got a buttload of video game adaptations). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In <Nineteen-Eighty-Six::1986>, "Bari Bari Densetsu" was adapted to that most exquisite and refined medium of our age, the anime. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The actual plot involves (wait for it) rebellious High School students who compete in illegal street racing. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, that's all well and good. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But aside from the intro, this is a [pretty] generic Racing Game with really no references to anything that occurs in the comic. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 While the manga is about street racing and eventually moves on to professional racing in Japan, the game offers the standard assortment of international racetracks in Europe, the U.S., Australia, and South America. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Though the starter racetrack is in Japan, and no racetrack names or cities are given - just the country. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Also, the race courses are all just, like, a flat grassy field with no stands or spectators. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Even though the Ferris wheel in the background of the Japanese course seems to suggest that it's the, uh, Suzuka race course. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The backgrounds vary from country to country. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The U.S. course has Manhattan in the background. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In Australia, you can see the Sydney Opera House. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 However, some of the backgrounds are repeated. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 For example, Holland has windmills and such, but the exact same picture is used for France. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 A mountain range background and a forest background are also repeated a few times. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As a result, this sure feels like the game was in production before the license was obtained and that very little consideration was made to tie this into either the manga or the anime. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, there are two modes. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 'Travel' just lets you practice on the various courses; it's just a solo ride around the track. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The story mode is 'W.G.P.'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Presumably, that stands for 'World Grand Prix'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Though calling it a story mode is a bit of an exaggeration. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's no story, per se; it's just a series of races. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Maybe career mode might be a bit more accurate. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But there aren't any cutscenes or dialogue between races or anything that might suggest a story. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, naturally, you've got to qualify for each race. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is just a solo timed trial. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 How well you do will determine which position ya get for the actual race. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, your bike has quite a few customization options. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Unlike some of the many R.P.G. style Racing Games we've seen in the 'Chron...' series, you don't have to purchase any parts. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Everything is unlocked from the very beginning. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Some things are obvious, like Slick Tires versus Rain Tires or Hard Brakes versus Regular, but others are not. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I have no idea what a Peaky Engine is or how it differs from a Normal or Wide Engine, or how Soft or Hard Suspension impacts your performance in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, the regular competitive race has you just doing a few laps against other riders. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The weird thing is, there are tons of extra riders on the track. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, you'll always be passing people even if you're in the front of the pack. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I assume this is to give the game a bit of extra challenge. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, you'll always need to be weaving back and forth between other motorcycles, no matter how way ahead of everyone else you are. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's kind of irritating when you see a bike ahead of you and you pass it, thinking you're gonna, like, move up one position, but, 'Nope! You're still in the same spot even after you pass it.'. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And "Bari Bari Densetsu" is not really bad. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's addictive in the way a lot of Racing Games are. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's just, you know, a regular old motorcycle Racing Game that looks quite nice. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mr Heli no Daibouken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 December 1 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And the final game of November is "Mr. Heli no Daibouken", from Irem! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The second Irem P.C. Engine game (the first being a port of "Vigilante"). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Mr. Heli no Daibouken" is also a port of an Arcade game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And it's not at all clear who was responsible for this port (Irem themselves or some unknown contractor). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It is [pretty] darn faithful, however. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, let me start off with... I hate this game! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Obviously, many Shoot-'em-Ups are difficult, but (at least for me) this one takes the cake in terms of general frustration. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Maybe it's just me. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I don't know. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Here's the premise. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You're flying this cute little helicopter, named Mr. Heli. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Naturally, lots of other cute little spaceship things are trying to kill you. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Each of the two buttons fires a weapon: your standard peashooter up front - or a top-mounted gun that fires upwards. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Your default weapons are [pretty] terrible (your peashooter has extremely limited range, for example). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But they can be upgraded by buying things, "Fantasy Zone"-style, rather than by grabbing upgrades dropped by enemies, such as, like, in, uh, "Gradius" or "R-Type". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The currency for purchasing weapons upgrades are these little crystals that are trapped in bricks. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It seems most of the bricks are positioned so that they need to be either attacked from below or from above. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You can use your top-mounted gun to shoot bricks above you. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But if you want all those juicy crystals hidden in bricks along the bottom of the screen, you'll need to buy a supply of bombs, using crystals as currency. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As I mentioned, I don't know who ported this thing, but it is [pretty] darn accurate to the Arcade original (which came out in <Nineteen-Eighty-Seven::1987> and was released in the U.S. under the name, "Battle Chopper"). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, this P.C. Engine version never got a port on the <Turbo-Graphics-Sixteen::TurboGrafx-16>, but many years later got a Virtual Console release in Japan, and finally came to the U.S. Virtual Console in <Two-Thousand-Eighteen::2018>. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, for such a cute little game, "Mr. Heli..." is tough! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Unlike most arcade Shooters [of] the late <Eighties::'80s>, you [could] take multiple hits. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 (There's an Energy Bar up above, as you see.) 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 However, enemies come at you non-stop from both directions - or (in the vertically scrolling levels) from all four directions. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And they don't just move in simple patterns. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Instead, they constantly follow you around, trying to crash into you. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Seriously, the enemies in this are *constantly* making suicide attacks on you. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Mr. Heli..." is just so hectic, it's constantly trying to shoot bricks looking for crystals, while also trying to avoid and shoot multiple enemies and projectiles. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The weapons upgrades are a huge help, but you must A) have enough crystals to buy them, and B) you have to find the hidden shops that sell them. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You see, the shops are also hidden in the bricks. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, there will definitely be situations where you have the crystals but can't find a shop in which to spend them. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Furthermore, if you die, you lose your weapons upgrades *and* all your crystals. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Also, when you complete a level, you also lose your upgrades and your crystals - but your health is not refilled! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, on top of this, there's gravity in this game - meaning that if you stop moving, you begin to slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Which is odd because the one thing helicopters are quite good at is hovering in the air, and, you know, typically do not lose altitude when they stop moving forward, unlike a plane. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Bottom line: "Mr. Heli..." is a cute game, but damn... it can sure be rough. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 USA Pro Basketball 🇯🇵 // Takin' it to the Hoop 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 December 1 🇯🇵 // 1990 March 15 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: AiCOM 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: AiCOM 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Our second game of December <First::1st> is... a Basketball Game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is the first Basketball Game for the P.C. Engine, I believe, with the very imaginative title of "U.S.A. Pro Basketball". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is a [pretty] rad intro we have, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, this was developed and published by AiCOM, the now-defunct company who was also responsible for a few well-known Nintendo games, such as, uh, "Vice Project Doom", "The Mafat Conspiracy", "Astyanax", and (of course) "Totally Rad". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is AiCOM's third (and last) game for the P.C. Engine. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And AiCOM seemed to specialize in Basketball Games since we've already seen two others from them in 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There was "Hoops" and "All Pro Basketball". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "All Pro Basketball" even had, like, similar cover art to "U.S.A. Pro Basketball". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Though "All Pro..." features a, uh, player from the L.A. 'Breakers' and "U.S.A. Pro..." has the L.A. 'Lekkers'. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 All three games have these "Double Dribble"-style cutscenes where you get these slow-motion shots of your player in midair trying to do a slam dunk. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In <Nineteen-Ninety::1990>, this was released in the U.S. for the <Turbo-Graphics-Sixteen::TurboGrafx-16> by N.E.C., and was given the somewhat more radical-sounding name of "Takin' it to the Hoop". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Other than the title change and translating some of the Japanese text, the two versions appear to be identical. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, the roster is... interesting. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You have some very popular teams represented... but, of course, [only] by their city name. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, the Knicks, the Celtics, the Bulls (who are a <quote-unquote B-class team::"...B-class team...">, according to the manual), the Lakers, and also the Seattle Sonics. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And the Miami Heat - of which the manual says, "...has <quote> many star players. Perhaps the strongest team of [them] all.", which is actually slightly prophetic. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But in <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>, or <Nineteen-Ninety::1990>, this was nowhere even close to the truth. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Oh, and also there's a team from... Honolulu. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, the gameplay is very simple. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 When you have the ball, button one passes and button two shoots. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 When the other team has the ball, button one steals, and button two changes the active player. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Like a lot of Sports Games, this is kind of annoying since, if the other team passes the ball, you will need to suddenly start hitting button one, cycling through your team members, until you reach one that's close enough to the guy that actually has the ball, now. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 When you shoot while you're right up next to the basket, this cutscene will be triggered. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And the game actually does something a little different, here. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's a meter that appears that you, sort of, need to hit the button, uh, right when the cursor is in the center. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Doing so will ensure that you actually get the ball in the basket. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, it's very similar to the meters used in Golf Games when you're swinging your club. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As always, the player versus computer mode has a very irritating feature: namely the computer's godlike ability to pull off certain actions. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In this case, it's stealing the ball. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The computer can just send in a guy to take away the ball from you, whenever it wants. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Any time one of the C.P.U.'s players even touches you, 'Blam! They get the ball.'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 On the other hand, it is very difficult for you to steal the ball from the computer. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, the final verdict is, 'It's... okay?'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, it's the [only] Basketball Game on the system by <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, we can either take it or leave it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Battle Ace 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 November 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, we come to a very odd chapter in the P.C. Engine history. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The last game of November is "Battle Ace" from Hudson. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, what's so strange about this? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As you know, the P.C. Engine launched in Japan at the end of October <Nineteen-Eighty-Seven::1987>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The C.D.-ROM-ROM add-on came out right at the beginning of December <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Not counting the Karaoke Discs, [only] around nine C.D.-ROM games had been released by November <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, it was still a [pretty] new platform. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Despite this, on December <Eighth::8th>, <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>, N.E.C. released a brand new console, the P.C. Engine <Super-Graphics::SuperGrafx>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 At launch, it [only] had one available game, "Battle Ace". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Originally developed under the name P.C. Engine <Two::2>, the <Super-Graphics::SuperGrafx> was originally gonna debut in <Nineteen-Ninety::1990>, but it was pushed up to December (presumably to be on the shelves for the holiday season). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This seems [pretty] crazy. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, rushing out new consoles with no rhyme or reason is actually Sega's gig, not N.E.C.'s. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Battle Ace", as we can see, is basically an "AfterBurner" clone. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It looks really good. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The <Super-Graphics::SuperGrafx> was a, uh, beefier console. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It had four times as much RAM as the P.C. Engine and a second video chip. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Also, it was backwards-compatible. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It played P.C. Engine cards and worked with the C.D.-ROM peripheral. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, I'm guessing N.E.C.'s idea was to get people buying these <Super-Graphics::SuperGrafx>, and then transition from selling P.C. Engine games to <Super-Graphics::SuperGrafx> games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, this is definitely an interesting strategy, but it didn't work out because virtually no one actually bought the damn thing. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It sold about <seventy-five-thousand::75,000> units total. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As a comparison, the FamiCom sold around <twenty::20> million units (or about <two-hundred-'n'-sixty-six::266> times as many consoles as the <Super-Graphics::SuperGrafx>). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, it probably didn't help that the thing was ugly as sin. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Uh... Not to mention, once again, there was [only] one game released for the thing in the entire year of <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 N.E.C. seemed to have big plans for the <Super-Graphics::SuperGrafx>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They were planning to release some peripherals, like this crazy controller deck, called the Power Console. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This was supposed to come out in Spring <Nineteen-Ninety::1990> [but] never did. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As it turned out, [only] five retail games were released for the <Super-Graphics::SuperGrafx>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Yes, that's right - five games (none of which were really that interesting). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It made the Sega <Thirty-Two-X::32X> look like a huge success, in comparison. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, over time, N.E.C. ended up focusing more on the C.D.-ROM-ROM platform, expanding the system's, uh, capabilities by using HuCards that added more RAM to C.D.-ROM games. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As for "Battle Ace", it's nothing special. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You shoot down enemy ships using your guns and homing missiles. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 At the end of each stage, you will encounter a boss. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Once he's defeated, you move on to the next planet and then the pattern repeats. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, we will see some more <Super-Graphics::SuperGrafx> games in <Nineteen-Ninety::1990>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Just don't really expect much from this console. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shinobi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 December 8 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Sega | Dual 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Asmik 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And our last game this episode is... "Shinobi", published by Asmik (who would later be known as Asmik Ace). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They were the video game arm of a film and media company. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It does seem weird that Sega would put their own games out on a competing console. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But you might recall that in <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988>, N.E.C. did release P.C. Engine ports of "Fantasy Zone" and "Space Harrier". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 These even got a U.S. release. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Shinobi", however, is a Japanese-[only] title. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It was ported by a company called 'Dual', who were previously known as Klon (K-L-O-N). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They also worked on "Super Air Zonk" and apparently "Predator" for the Nintendo Entertainment System. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There were two other ports of this to home consoles. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We saw the Sega Master System version some time ago. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And the N.E.S. version published by Tengen will be coming up real soon in the next 'Chrontendo'. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And this is, I suppose, the best-looking port of this game, which isn't really saying much. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The original Arcade version from <Nineteen-Eighty-Seven::1987> wasn't exactly the most visually thrilling game in the universe when it came out. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But, you know, it was okay. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 One thing: You did automatically switch to a quick melee attack when you got close to an enemy. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, for some reason, this was left out from the P.C. Engine version. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Also, the between-level bonus rounds are missing. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So... I don't know; I don't really have much to say about this. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The first "Shinobi" game wasn't that great to begin with. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is a semi-competent port. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We've already seen "Revenge of Shinobi" on the Genesis. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, quite frankly, there's really just no going back to the original, for me, at this point. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 6 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Well, that wraps up another one! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We're a bit behind on 'Chronturbo', so there'll be another episode sooner, rather than later. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "...Episode <Six::{7}>" is gonna be a big one, featuring a classic C.D.-ROM-ROM title. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I'm sure you know the one that I'm talking about. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Yep! That's right. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "ROM-ROM Karaoke <Volume Three::Vol. 3>". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, the Best Game this episode? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I guess, "Neutopia"? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, it's a nice-looking and rather slick Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Certainly a lot of work and polish went into "Neutopia". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's obviously very derivative of "...Zelda...". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Daichikun Crisis..." is far more original, but sort of irritating to actually play. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And "Cratermaze" is cute and fun, but there's not really any depth to it. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Worst Game? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Well, I mean, the Karaoke Disc and the Stock Market Simulation Game, I mean, barely even count as games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Mr. Heli ... Daibouken" is definitely the game I hated playing the most. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, it looks nice, it's got personality, but I just detested it. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, next up in the old 'Chron...' pipeline: "Chrontendo Episode <fifty-four::54>" will finish up <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>, and we will finally reach the year <Nineteen-Ninety::1990>. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, for you mature viewers, the next Video Nasties will be all about "Blood Feast". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And there will be an extensive (and I mean, *extensive*) look at Herschell Gordon Lewis' entire cinematic oeuvre. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Until then, stay safe and keep hanging in, there. 🍇🍌
