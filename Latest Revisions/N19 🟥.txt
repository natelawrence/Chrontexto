👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 19 ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Thanks [for] tuning in to "Chrontendo Episode *19*". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 [What do] we have this time? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, oddly enough, a sudden increase [in] {the} number of Sports Titles (of all things) *including two* Pool Games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In *addition*, there's a few *ports* of smaller Japanese *Computer Games*, as well [as] another nice Konami release. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And [we'll] be taking a very brief look [at] one of Nintendo's [most] successful marketing tools in the U.S. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Computer Golf: US Course 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 14 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "...Episode *19*"'s [first] game comes from the ever-busy *Nintendo* (too busy [to] develop their own *games* [as] a [matter] of fact). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Thus, this is another [title] from HAL Laboratory, who would eventually become one of Nintendo's major [second]-party *developers*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Heck! Satoru Iwata, the [*president*] of HAL, eventually became the C.E.O. of Nintendo *themselves*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, the two companies are intimately connected. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, [what] sort [of] exciting game does *HAL* have in *store*? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 *Hmm*... How's *this* for a [great] idea? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's *Mario* playing *Golf*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Now, wait a [second].', you say, '[Haven't] we seen this game before?'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Yes, we have; two times [as] a [matter] of fact. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is "FamiCom Golf: U.S. Course", the sequel to "FamiCom Golf: Japan Course" which came out (well, [not that] long ago) back [in] February [*1987*]. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One unusual thing about this game is the pre-game *credits*, which [lists] Hiroshi Yamauchi (Nintendo's *president* at the time) as the executive [producer], and Masayuki Uemura as producer. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Kazunobu Shimizu is mostly known for "F-Zero" released for Super Nintendo. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Despite] all the big names [in] the credits, "FamiCom Golf..." of -- is, of course, [just] a [reworked] version of, uh, "...*Japan* Course". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And "...Japan Course" was a reworked version of the old Nintendo "Golf". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As in all these games you have the power gauge which controls the strength and direction of the shot. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Hitting] on the [white] line [will] give ya the [best] shot. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You [can] choose [from] {a} variety of clubs - even step back [and] take a few practice swings. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's the wind to factor in [and] then, once ya [get] on the [putting] green, the view [will switch] to an overhead shot. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 All in all, not too terribly exciting [and] not even [as] much fun to play [as] *last* episode's "Pro Golfer *Saru*...". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess the [most *notable*] thing *about* this game was the *contest* done [in] conjunction with [its] release. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You [could] take [your] *disc* with [your] saved *game* down [to the] *video* game store [and insert it into] one [of] the special F.D.S. fax machines. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This would send [your] score off to *Nintendo*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Players [with] the [*best*] scores would [get] *one* of 10,000 *copies* [of] the special *game*. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 [And that] game was none other [than] "*Punch*-Out!!". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The, uh, *special* "Punch-Out *Gold*" cartridge is a [bit] -- little [bit different than] the version [that] was actually, uh, given a wide retail release [*later*, but we'll] have [to] save [that] for another time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dr. Chaos 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 19 🇯🇵 // 1988 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SRS | Marionette 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 // FCI 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 From the ever-reliable Pony Canyon we have another F.D.S. classic. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, [not] really. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But "Dr. Chaos" has a ［pretty］ cool [*title*] screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, wow! Look [at that] dripping blood [and] *everything*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This looks ［pretty］ spooky! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, [what] is this? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 An early Survival Horror Game? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 A "Maniac Mansion"-like Adventure Game? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Dr. Chaos" is a ［pretty］ intriguing *name*. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Unfortunately, despite] the promise displayed in in... -- in the *intro*, uh, "Dr. Chaos" is a [bit] disappointing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is a Pony *Canyon* game, after all. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh! The Grim Reaper, [himself], even appears. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once we go ahead [and] load up the game, you'll see [that], well, there are some rats [and] bats running [around] this house. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [But] "Dr. Chaos" [isn't] really a Horror Game (uh, [unless] you consider the *controls* [to] be horrifyingly *bad*). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, the game, uh, "Dr. Chaos" most *resembles* is Konami's "...Goonies *II*", which [had only come out around], uh, [like], *three [months] before* this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, "Dr. Chaos" [can't] be deliberate knockoff. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Rather, they must [have] drawn from the same well of inspiration. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They're both side-scrolling [Platformers] with [Point] and Click Adventure elements thrown *in*. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Whenever ya enter a *room* the view switches {to} [first]-*person* [and] ya have [to] use a [little hand to] open doors, pick up [items], and so on. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Mostly we're looking for weapons, health, and the occasional hidden passage. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yes. And one rather hateful thing: 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You will find is these rand... -- random monsters coming out of doors in the room. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 These'll push you back into the hall and you'll need to dispose of them before re-entering the room. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The rather stiff and unresponsive controls (and the fact these monsters tend to hit you and then stand right on top of you) make this very irritating. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You're actually looking at the English version of the game, as opposed to the Japanese version. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There really aren't any key items to be found in the rooms nor any other actual characters (no one's really talked to - like in "...Goonies", for example), 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 All the key items are actually found at the, uh -- by defeating the Bosses. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Dr. Chaos" was given a U.S. release by FCI. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's a company related to Pony Canyon that often released the Pony Canyon games in the United States. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It was released in 1988. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game is often compared to "Shadowgate", one of the, uh, map adventure point-and-click game released for the Macintosh. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, "Shadowgate" was first released in 1987 as well, so it couldn't have been a direct influence. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Presumably "Dr. Chaos" well, could have been inspired by the early Adventure Games such as "Uninvited", or more likely by Japanese [style] Adventure Games like the "Portopia...". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, some rooms have a hidden entrance to Warp Zones. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and speaking of Warp Zones, this scene might remind you of something found in a perhaps better known game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here's the first Boss, he's certainly easy. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... Others can be absurdly hard. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are 11 of these Warp Zones all together, all quite similar and with a ［pretty］ limited variety of enemies - sort of, get the same enemies over and over again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are occasionally these tougher enemies that come around like these fly... -- flying skeletons or these, uh, weird fat skeletons (called 'elephants', for some reason) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm trying to deal with some of the flying skeletons now. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not quite sure what's up with the 'elephant'? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Maybe he's supposed to resemble the, uh, elephant man's skeleton? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, unlike "...Goonies II", "Dr. Chaos" is not a huge game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The mansion has four floors and about, uh, 20 - 25 rooms 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, one annoying thing about the game: 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (I was just throwing some grenades) Grenades actually damage you as well as the enemies. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's a password system in the U.S. version so you can restart with no weapons if you die. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Dr. Chaos" is maybe somewhat fondly remembered by some gamers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Perhaps because there weren't that many games like it on the MDS back then). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And while the games, uh, seems somewhat ambitious, the execution is bad enough to categorize it as a mediocre game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This should be expected because it was developed by SRS and Marionette (two Japanese contract developers). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They were the same team behind "The Adventures of Chatran" (that 'Milo and Otis' game we covered few episodes ago). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The overall design is ［pretty］ uninspired; ［pretty］ much every room in the mansion looks identical. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Killing enemies may be a bit of pain. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Regular enemies tend to respond very quickly on screen (sometimes right in front of you or in the exact same spot you just killed one). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... Too many large enemies on the scene will cause massive slowdown (as we see here).🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The combined fact that they will follow you and try to mob you can cause some major headaches. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you run out of ammo before you kill a Boss, you're［*pretty*] much screwed. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes, and those monsters that push you out to the hallway (like you saw a few moments ago) can, uh, ［pretty］ much drain you of your life way too quickly as we're doing multiple hits over and over again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here I've had a problem with running out of, uh, ammo before I could actually kill the *boss* thus making him ［*pretty*］ much undefeatable. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's another one of those hallway monsters. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This one actually slows you down... and ［pretty］ much it, sort of, stands on top of you. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, should you actually make it to the Final Boss (which turns out to be a lion throwing fireballs), um, you could use all the parts you've been collecting to make a laser (the ［only］ weapon can -- that can defeat this boss). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Dr. Chaos" is incidentally your scientists brother, who got himself in trouble by opening gateways to another [dimension] (sort of like "Half-Life" or something) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 At the end you rescue him and you're reunited in this oddly romantic looking sequence. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Dr. Chaos" nice idea, but, sort of, bad execution. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's probably still about the best Pony Canyon game so far - uh, not developed by either Compile or Toaplan. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And if for some reason you actually make it to the end of the game, you'll get one of these old-fashioned hilariously understated 'Congratulations' messages that used to appear when you finished a video game back in the day. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Boxing 🇯🇵 // Ring King 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 19 🇯🇵 // 1987 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Woodplace | Namco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // Data East 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This episode has two Data East games both released in 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The first up is "Ring King", the more notorious of the two. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... It was retitled for its Japanese release by Namco as "Family Boxing". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Namco is releasing a series of 'family sports' games with the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Prior to this was "Family Stadium" and "Family Jockey".) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But this is a port of the 1985 Arcade Game from an obscure little publisher Woodplace called "King of Boxer". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Data East released the game in the arcades in the U.S. as "Ring King". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, not surprisingly, they called the N.E.S. version that as well. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately for "Ring King", it came out a few months before the well-loved "Punch-Out". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And while "Punch-Out" is ［pretty］ much everything you could hope for a Boxing Game, "Ring King" falls way way short of what you would want in any video game, period. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Aside from the obvious complaints - the ugly characters (or rather just *one* ugly character with, uh, multiple weird *palette* swaps), [and] the, sort of, bad sound effects, hard [to use] ...ntrol -- controls - um, the *main thing* about "Ring King" is it's [just] plain *boring*! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {The} port is actually a little *slower* than the Arcade version; everything seems ［pretty］ *sluggish*. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 While "Ring King" is certainly not a good game, I don't know if it's quite as bad as people think it is. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It tends to make a lot of worst of N.E.S lists. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's not exactly a whole lot of fun to play. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, probably the thing about this game that's been most ridiculed is the between round cutscenes, where the parody or tendon is performing oral sex on you. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is actually just bad work from Namco or the port of this thing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the original Arcade version its clearly just your cup is being adjusted or something like that. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Namco did have the largesse to add a few gameplay options. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Tournament' (or a series of boxers in order to contend for the championship). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's a 2-Player version, uh, (lets you rope in an unfortunate soul to play it with you). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, the 'Watch' option (features computer controlled opponents). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Concerning how unpleasant "Ring King" is to play, that actually might be your best bet. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here you can see what I mean about, sort of, weird palette swaps. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Why does the guy have green hair? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, if you're a huge Boxing Game fanatic, I guess you can certainly try this out but, uh, don't expect anything near the level of "Punch-Out". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Michael English Daibouken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Scorpion Soft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Scorpion Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 We have a few games by ultra obscure publishers this time around. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And this is one of them! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Michael English Daibouken" by Scorpion Soft, a rather deceptively-titled game, since there is nothing 'Dai' or 'Bouken'-y about this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Because it's an educational game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For those not in the know this game is based on a licensed property, 'What's Michael?', a very popular manga by Makoto Kobayashi (commonly described as the Japanese 'Garfield', due to Michael's appearance as an orange cat). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The title indicates this is an English learning game, apparently to teach young children the English alphabet and some basic vocabulary. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you select your world and your level, and then you're off to learn some English letters. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's a few different gameplay variations available in this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... So, on this one, for example, you simply need to copy the English word by grabbing the right letters. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Every game seems to have the same basic mechanic.🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You control Michael, and the object is to dump -- jump around crazily and grab the correct letter as it rises out of the ground while avoiding the incorrect ones. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Presumably Michael is doing all this for the sake of his kittens in an attempt to improve their English skills. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Touching that cat head will give you a hint, um, by showing you the word in Japanese. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oddly enough on the space level, the kittens are all wearing space helmets [while] Michael is somehow able to survive naked in the icy vacuum 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Does this game achieve its goal of teaching kids English? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I don't know it's hard to say. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... I guess it seems well done (better than those Sunsoft educational games). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing: Michael doesn't really look much like his comic book counterpart. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, I guess Scorpion Soft seems to have put together a rather decent title. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, who are these Scorpion Soft guys? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 No idea. As far as I know, they ［only］ released one more game for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Please note the presence of the cross on the church in the background, there. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That probably wouldn't have flown, had this game, uh, been given a U.S. release (which, obviously it wouldn't have). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, Michael gets a little halo when he dies. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can save your game or rather you can save your scores and continue on. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... I just failed a level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, I have the ominous blackpoll which equals death on the scorecard there. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Woody Poco 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by dB-Soft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by dB-Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hurray! it's "Woody Poco"! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Look at all those little dancing Woody Pocos! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Who the hell is Woody Poco? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I really have no idea. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But I can tell you this is a somewhat mysterious exploration-based side-view Action Game released by dB-SOFT. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's been a while since we've done a dB-SOFT game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The last was "Layla", a space-themed side-scrolling Action Game released in December of 1986. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 dB-SOFT mostly released games for Japanese computers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And "Woody Poco" was one of those games - originally released in late 1986 on such systems as the P.C.-88 and the FM 77. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is the P.C.-88 version here 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It has much cooler music than the FamiCom version 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One mystery surrounding this game is, 'Who is actually responsible for making it?'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you might have noticed on the title screen in the FamiCom version, it shows the copyright to dB-SOFT and 'Layla and Danny' 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Who the heck or what the heck is Layla and Danny? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Are there any, uh, relationship to dB-SOFT's "Layla" game, or is it just a coincidence? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, to confuse matters other versions like those for -- [released] for the P.C.s (such as, uh, the P.C.-88 [and] this one right here, which is actually the M.S.X. version) credit Minassan Omedetou Yokattane. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Is this some little-known Japanese developer? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Is "Woody Poco" a licensed character? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Why, I really couldn't find the answer to that. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Either way, this game is a somewhat, uh, typical of the post-"...Zelda" Adventure Game type thing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You roam around killing monsters, visiting shops to purchase items, collecting money. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One unique feature is you possess two hands and you can hold one item in each hand (just like real life!). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Your goal is to make your way across the landscape towards a castle where you have to (uh, well, surprise surprise) rescue a Princess. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In fact, an item's function may change depending on which hand you hold it in. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing you do need to buy is a candle in order to light the dark underground passages. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You enter these like the various holes that occasionally appear on the overworld. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There is the candle shop there. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, I'm, sort of, firing the little -- the spheroid, uh, shaped thing that you can see in my hand is, uh, what used to fire a weapon. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 When you buy the candle you need to hold it in your other hands in order to use it. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Woody Poco" is a fascinating-looking game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are an unusual number of items to be had (at least more than in most games for this time period). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, there are shoes (for speeding you up), umbrellas (that'll, uh, slow your descent when you jump so you can jump over like, uh, various lakes and rivers and whatnot). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Getting around in "Woody Poco" seems to be a bit more involved than in most of these games. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so I've entered one of the underground passages here to pick up some extra money. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But definitely simply, uh, you know, rescuing the Princess isn't really a simple matter of walking left or right. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, it's certainly not nearly as, uh, spread out as "...Legend of Zelda". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There is, sort of, like a general progression that you're making. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But some of these underground passes are actually multiple layers deep. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, you may be in a cavern, and you'll find another hole that picks down to a lower cavern. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Another interesting little feature is when you select the game, you can actually, uh, choose what gender (whether you want to play as a boy or girl). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ah, that demonstrates how the umbrella is used. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There seem to have been a few changes made from the original computer versions for the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... It seems like the interface is a little bit easier to use when it comes to switching items. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And also the layout has been changed around a bit as well. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you know, this is a ［pretty］ unknown in the West and it looks like it really could be deserving of further investigation. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Exciting Billiards 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 26 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 All of a sudden, we've got all these Sports Games coming out. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you think back a bit, for a while, there were hardly a sports title for the system, other than a handful of releases by Nintendo themselves. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the Sport genre seems to be coming to life on the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's ［pretty］ obvious this is a Pool Game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Exciting Billard" is, in fact, the first in little surge of Sports Games Konami released - all with the word 'Exciting' in the title. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Of course, the title needs -- try convince you the game is exciting, well then, maybe it really isn't that exciting after all. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, nice atmospheric intro, here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You might think the guy is carrying a baseball bat or something do some inter alley ass kicking but no he's just walking into a pool club. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 If nothing else, uh, "Exciting Billiards" seems to exist in a somewhat concrete environment. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The pool club is given, sort of, a, uh, certain amount of convincing detail. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Note the 'Hustler's Club' name on the marquee. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Konami seems have a real fascination with the word 'hustler' as pertained to pool. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... And look at this bar; looks like they're well-stocked in Tanqueray gin. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, there is definitely a gambling theme going on in this game, as you're, uh, placing bets on your pool abilities. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The actual bar room is rather nicely detailed, um, with a pinball table, uh, drinks sitting on the table in the corner, that sort of thing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Lunar Pool" was the first Pool Game for the FamiCom but "Exciting Billiards" expands the realism of earlier Pool Games with the, uh, multiple views of the action going on there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you *play* the game by using your D-Pad to control the direction of your pool cue. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you do this, it gives you a very nice worm's eye view of the balls there that sort of moves around as you move your pool cue around. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Use the button to pull the pool cue back and then strike the b... -- , uh, the cue ball. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The little power gauge lets you know how hard the ball is going to be hit. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game is, sort of, an original for the FamiCom but not quite. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's roots go back to "Video Hustler", an early '80s Arcade Game from Konami. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Video Hustler" was ［pretty］ typical of Pool Games at the time and had a very simple control scheme. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Then, a little later, in 1987, Konami released "Rack'em Up" to the arcades - which, in Japan, was called (what else?) "The Hustler". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is really just an Arcade variation of "Exciting Billiards" - with some almost identical details (like the wood floor or the cutscenes of you making the shot). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's hard to say which was conceived first, the Arcade Game or the F.D.S. one. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, as I was saying there's a heavy gambling element in "Exciting B... -- Billiards". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You're often asked to, sort of, make little bets at particular points in the game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Another nice feature pressing the A button will show you the numbers on the balls. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And as we've seen the natural mechanic for shooting the balls is, uh, sort of, very similar to that found in Nintendo's "Golf". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I've never really been a huge fan of Pool Games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's not like there's any shortage of places to play pool in the real world. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But for people who really love pool, um, I guess they might get a kick out of this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I suppose the physics seems ［pretty］ decent. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, I like "Lunar Pool" from Compile and Pony Canyon quite a lot better. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... But I guess I can't really fault this game for being what it is. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just like I mentioned with "Dynamite Bowl" last episode, the basic mechanics of this, sort of, game haven't really changed much in the last 20 years. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though, of course, nowadays, this, sort of, thing wouldn't be, uh, wouldn't be really a full real... -- retail release. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It'd more like be a minigame or something included inside another game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Moero!! Pro Yakyuu 🇯🇵 // Bases Loaded 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 26 🇯🇵 // 1988 July [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hey, it's another Baseball Game (third one for the system). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And from Jaleco its "Moero!! Pro Yakyuu" which starts with a ［pretty］ cool intro. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The player hits a rather ridiculous home run. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's one straw pitcher, but what an arrogant bastard. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Him running around constantly, uh, pumping his fist as he jogs around the island. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, as you may have figured out, this is the same game known in the U.S. as "Bases Loaded". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, God! What an ugly title screen! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That logo looks so much worse than the one with a Japanese version. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As far as I can tell, not much has changed. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You begin by selecting the team and your starting pitcher. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The city names are provided. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But unlike the earlier "R.B.I. Baseball", there's no baseball license provided here so the players are all completely fictional. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the Japanese version, I think at least some of the players were based on real individuals. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Stats are conveniently provided for all the pitchers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, there's two gameplay options you can play against the computer, or you can play against another person in the versus mode. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, right off the bat, we noticed that "Moero!!..." tries to depict the game in a much more detailed and realistic fashion then earlier Baseball Games (like Nintendo's Baseball or "R.B.I. Baseball" where all the characters are, sort of, chubby and cartoonish looking). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As the pitcher, you use the D-Pad to control the direction of the pitch. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The degree of control over the ball is surprisingly ［pretty］ high - a bit more so than in the two earlier games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Fielding controls are ［pretty］ standard; you know, you catch the ball and then use the D-Pad, uh, to select which base you want to throw it to. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But check out that crazy floating catcher's mitt. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 He never moves, but the mitt just floats around. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, here's the question is "Moero!!..." {a} port of an Arcade Game? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I'm not sure. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There was this Arcade version released by Jaleco, which looks very similar to the FamiCom version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The copyright says 1988, but some Japanese sources say it was released in '87 (maybe late 1987?). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I assume both versions were developed in tandem. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Odd thing there was already, sort of, similar situation with that Konami Pool Game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, going back to the home version, I should point out that this was developed by none other than Tose (the infamous and secretive contract developer responsible for so many bad FamiCom games). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This seems of higher quality than their usual stuff. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Listen to all the, uh, impressive voice samples, for example, (［pretty］ unusual at the time). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This was prominently mentioned on the cover of the U.S. version. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Regardless, there is some weirdness in this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing that I don't like is that while the behind-the-pitcher view is ［pretty］ cool for pitching, it's really not so good for batting. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It takes a while to distinguish between good and bad pitches. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And swinging the bat correctly does take some practice. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just like pitching, you use the D-Pad to control how you swing ( sort of, Up, Down, et cetera). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, it seems a little awkward, and the pitches look really weird. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Often it seems like the, uh, pitcher is aiming at my shins. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really sure exactly why they keep throwing the ball so low. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, in the U.S., this game is fondly remembered by some. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess the, uh, voice samples, realistic graphics and good controls made a ［pretty］ good impression back in 1988, uh, despite some of the flaws. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In Japan, "Moero!!..." seems to be thought of rather poorly. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Teams are often unbalanced and the C.P.U. can be very stupid. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There's also a bug that will prevent the C.P.U. from swinging at low pitches made by left-handed pitchers. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... There are some cool details. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Most famously, beaning certain batters with the ball will cause him to run to the mound to fight you. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, it didn't happen while I was recording this video. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'd say uh, "Moero!!..." or "Bases Loaded" is a fun game, sort of, pick up and play. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I just scored a home run here, pitcher is always so upset. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally it happens. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 He should really get over it. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... I don't think this will really probably satisfy your average hardcore Baseball Game fan. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 ［It］ doesn't seem to have the same devoted following as the 'RBI' games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 Nintendo Power Origins + Effects ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Before we move on to our next title, let's take a moment to look at one of Nintendo's most successful tools for marketing the N.E.S. in the United States, namely 'Nintendo Power' magazine. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As I've mentioned before, 1987 was really the year the N.E.S. took off in the U.S. with Nintendo bringing out huge releases like "...Zelda", "Metroid" and "Punch-Out", and a bunch of third-party developers coming on board. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 By returning a filled out form to Nintendo you can be enrolled in the Nintendo Fun Club. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Nintendo Power' actually began life as a simple newsletter sent out to Fun Club members. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In early 1987, the first issue of the correlating Nintendo Fun Club news was mailed out. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The rather humble black, white, and red eight-page publication promoted "Super Mario Bros." on the cover, mentioned upcoming releases, and contained a few articles regarding events surrounding Nintendo. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo of America's Howard Phillips was introduced as the public face of Nintendo in the U.S. (though he's missing his trademark bow and tie at this point). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also notable was the very brief prose corner column found in the letter section. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, tips, strategies, and guides will become the raison d'etre afforded to no power with virtual walkthroughs for popular titles taking up a huge chunk of each issue. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Issue number two, (Spring '87) featured "...Zelda" on the cover, and again with issue three (which, uh, switch formats to full color and longer issues). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Issue three contained ads from other publishers, with write ups announcing new release titles like, uh, "Kid Icarus". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 A big strategy guide for "...Zelda" dominated this issue, including the endlessly reprinted World Map and a two-page spread. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 By 1988, the newsletter was running bi-monthly (each issue running about 30 pages). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Major new releases like "Punch-Out" were given detailed coverage. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also found were lots of upcoming titles and previews such as this one for "Dragon Warrior" (around two years before it was released in the U.S.). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Full page ads from ［pretty］ much every company that released games, the system dotted the magazine, including this one for Tengen in it's pre-unlicensed days. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Issue six featured a covered story on the supposedly forthcoming "Zelda II...", which ended up being delayed several times - so readers could get tips on playing a game that wouldn't be released in the U.S. for another eight months or so. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Issue seven was the final one for the 'Nintendo Fun Club News'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The first issue of the slicker 'Nintendo Power' hit the shelves next month featuring a very cool "Super Mario Bros. 2" cover. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The new 100 page magazine once again focused heavily on write ups of new releases, as well as detailed guides with tons of screenshots laid out in a comic book-like fashion. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not just Nintendo's, but also other publishers releases were profiled. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Virtually every forthcoming game got some kind of promotion in 'Nintendo Power''s pages. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also found were reader submissions, the Howard and Nester comic strip (featuring a cartoon version of Howard Phillips), game sales, charts and so on. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Non-Nintendo publishers even got cover stories. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And of course, when "Zelda II..." was actually released, it did receive heavy coverage. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Nintendo Power' was incredibly successful in building loyalty to the 'Nintendo' brand. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And of course, it's still published to this day, though not by Nintendo themselves. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the days before the World Wide Web or Brady guidebooks, 'Nintendo Power' and related publications was the source for guides, maps and secrets for N.E.S. games, and was invaluable in helping establish Nintendo's dominance in the U.S. market in the pre-PlayStation era. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Saido Poketto 🇯🇵 // Side Pocket 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 30 🇯🇵 // 1987 November 30 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // Data East 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Jesus! Another Pool Game? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As I've mentioned before, it's odd how different companies somehow release similar titles at the same time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In this case, both Konami and Data East released Pool Games in the same month. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But with "Exciting Billiard" it was the Japan-［only］ release and "Side Pocket" was another of Data East games intended for the U.S. market Like "Karate Champ". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 They both hit the shelves sometime in June. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... The exact date for "Side Pocket"s not even recorded, but it did see a Japanese release by Namco in October. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 A second ago, we saw the training mode that the game was kind enough to give you. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Shows you exactly how to use the different effects achieved by hitting the ball off center. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Side Park" in, sort of, a tournament mode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You need to progress through various championships city, state, U.S.A. and the world. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The controls are quite similar to "Exciting Billiards" with the power gauge controlled by two button presses, and even the image of the character hitting, uh, taking a shot found in the corner there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's no betting mechanic, but you do rack up points for sinking balls and from various bonuses (such as like hitting the ball into a certain corner). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Usually these are kind of tough but occasionally we'll get lucky. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like this one right here, for example; it's a ［pretty］ easy shot. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, all the points that you've obtained are added up, uh, with additional points based on things like, uh, the consecutive number of balls sunk and, uh, sinking them in numerical order (that sort of thing). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 All this adds up to your total. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Get enough points and you move on to the next level. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There actually is one last chance for some additional points; it's a Bonus Round. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes missing is very easy, and sometimes they're virtually impossible (like this one where there's, uh, light bulbs all over the table). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you become, uh, the champion, the, uh, well, the girl there will fall in love with you. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the Konami game, "Side Pocket" has, sort of, a classy old-fashioned vibe to it - as if you were some sort of well dressed gentleman pool player from the 1920s. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the physics are a little weird. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Look how slow the balls move when you break, even at max power. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 While I'm not a huge fan of Pool Games, "Side Pocket" is ［pretty］ good for this sort of thing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Decent controls, interesting scoring system, a bit of variety with the Bonus Rounds, um, or the super powerful balls that occasionally appear that sort of like knock everything around real fast. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Compared to the really horrible port of "Karate Champ", this is a nice little game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Data East is, uh, definitely a slippery little company. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There really isn't, sort of, consistency with their releases. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just look at all the, uh, bizarre games they've released, um, in the last few episodes, and they don't really seem to have established like a house style or anything like that. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But of all the third-party Nintendo publishers, they've been the quickest to focus on the U.S. market. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Other than Nintendo themselves, they were from the first release games in the U.S. ［only］. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tokoro-San no Mamorumo Semerumo 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ISCO 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Epic Sony Records 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once again, Sony dips its toe into the world of console gaming under the aegis of epic Sony records. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once again, they've teamed up with a crappy developer, ISCO, to release a game based on a musical artist. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Previously, we've seen "Seikima II..." from ISCO (a ［pretty］ bad game) and this one really isn't being better. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There is an odd water theme going on. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You're armed with a squirt gun with a mid supply of water. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As the water is depleted your range decreases. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 With this game we've now seen video games based on all three of the holy trinity of Japanese comedians/entertainers, 'Beat' Kitano, Sanma Akashiya, [and] now Tokoro Jōji (*also* known [as] Tokoro George) an immensely popular media figure. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Tokoro George has started movies, television shows, released countless albums, and so on 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Among his many credits is the Japanese voice of Homer Simpson. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hey, this Boss looks like a Big Daddy from 'BioShock'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Or maybe the, uh, creature from 'Robot Monster'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There is a bit of nonlinearity in this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 After you beat the Boss you can choose which, uh, several doors you want to enter in. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is kinda like, uh, "Zombie Hunter" (A game we'll be seeing later this episode). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Altogether this is, sort of, {an} interesting idea but, um, the game is completely entertaining. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One major problem: 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 How do you replenish your health and ammo? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, despite having absurdly little starting ammo, the refills are all hidden. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You've got to shoot to find it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, since your ammo is limited, you can't just go around shooting everywhere randomly. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, how the hell are you just to find health and ammo refills except by sheer dumb luck? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Even defeating a Boss doesn't replenish anything. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You start the next level with your health and ammo depleted. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is really, sort of, like a textbook example of bad game design. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One other notable thing: 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Each level has this weird timer illustrated by a cloud approaching the sun (you can see it up at the top of the screen there). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 When the cloud finally covers the sun, this major storm system blows in and the game gets even harder to play. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, this, uh, storm is so bad somehow even rains inside buildings. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 While I suppose the Kitano and Sanma games have their merits, this one should be avoided at all cost. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hokkaidō Rensa Satsujin: Ohōtsuku ni Kiyu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Armor Project | PAX Softnica 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Login Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 A nice haunting musical theme there. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest" fans, you probably notice the copyright to Armor Project on the title screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yep, this game is designed by Yuji Horii. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it's the follow-up to "Portopia..." which we covered way way way back in "Chrontendo Episode 6" 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As the title indicates, this game takes place in Hokkaido, but it opens with a little prologue in Tokyo (which, uh -- features what else? A, uh, crime investigation scene). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin..." is a port of a title that was originally released in 1984 on various Japanese computers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here's the P.C.-88 version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, this lacks the really cool music of the N.E.S. version, uh, which is too bad since the P.C.-88 had ［*pretty*］ good sound capabilities. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 All the illustrations were done in a more realistic style on these Computer versions 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom graphics were completely redrawn. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Note the controls; use the number pad to make your selection 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 On the FamiCom game you use the, uh, now standard control scheme in nav... -- navigating the menu with the D-Pad 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Other than the N.E.C. computers, it was released for the FM-7, the M.S.X., and, uh, more recently was imported to sell phones and that sort of thing, so it seems to be quite popular. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The basic game play is the same as "Portopia..." 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have your standard options of looking, talking, moving somewhere else, showing objects, people, among other things. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like in "Portopia...", you can collect phone numbers and you can make phone calls. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess to the casual viewer this seems ［pretty］ much identical to "Portopia..." but I think there actually were, sort of, like a few kind of changes made to the basic scenario. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing: I don't think there's a first-person maze in this game, like "Portopia..." had. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It was a lil... -- little annoying, and maybe not the best idea in an Adventure Game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are a few areas to explore at the beginning of the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Seems like you mostly, sort of, go around talking to folks and, uh, show them a picture of the victim, trying to get some information 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There is a little bit sex appeal found in this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Various, sort of, attractive female characters appear. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... This lady right here, for example, holding a little tiny martini glass (at least I think that's what that is). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And you'll grill these folks [for] information. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 *Look* [at] *this* idiot. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Let's discuss the credits on this game briefly. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game was published by ASCII under the name LoginSoft.🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you don't recall much about ASCII from earlier episodes, well, they weren't just a video game developer. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One of the things they did was publisher computing magazine called '*Login*'.🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 LoginSoft (the name that you see on the credits) was the affiliated publisher. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I don't know why this wasn't published by Enix as "Portopia..." was. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's something rather cool. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 After finishing with Tokyo prologue, you get the real intro to the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Where his name is prominently mentioned. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Very nice little title screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This rather cinematic delayed opening credits thing would have been very attention grabbing at the time. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And for those who don't know, Hokkaido is the northernmost Island in Japan. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Winters get very cold there, hence the bleak snowfield landscape depicted would be indicative of Hokkaido to Japanese gamers. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This port was done by Pax Softnica who was primarily a second-party developer from Nintendo. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They did Nintendo's "Volleyball", for example. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The excellent music was produced by Toshiyuki Ueno who also did some music for "Earthbound", which was another Pax Sofnica developed title. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 By the way, Horii created a *third* game [and] formed, [sort] of, an unofficial trilogy of computer Adventure Mystery Games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This last one is called "Karuizawa Kidnapping Guidance" in English - a *rather clunky* [title]. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, it never received a FamiCom port. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mirai Shinwa Jarvas 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 June 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's been a while since we've seen a game from Taito. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Their last game was a port of "Arkanoid" from December 1986. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Of all the big Arcade Game companies Taito has had the least impressive resume when it comes to FamiCom games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And "Mirai Shinwa Jarvas" is certainly not going to improve their standing. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yes, Taito finally has decided to jump on the old "...Zelda"/R.P.G. train. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "...Jarvis" hit the shelves a mere 11 months after Namco released their crappy Action R.P.G. that "Valkerie" game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Undoubtedly some executive title saw the sales numbers for "...Zelda" and "Dragon Quest", and said it was time they finally got in on the action. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 By the way, this is a fan-translated version of the game, as this was certainly never released outside of Japan. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, there is some sort of plot behind the game; your spaceship has crashed on this strange planet, but don't expect any sort of opening cutscenes or explanatory text. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game ［pretty］ much just deposits you on the overworld without any reference to what's going on. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing that's a little odd is that even though you are clearly some sort of spaceman dude, you're armed with a dagger of some sort. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, really, shouldn't you have some kind of ray gun? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The world is populated by little Viking dudes wandering around. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, if you walk around long enough, you'll eventually find the first town (though don't expect the townspeople {to} say anything interesting *whatsoever*). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you're here, you can, you know, buy weapons, armor, et cetera (you know just the usual stuff) not to mention Healing Potions, but there don't really seem to be a whole lot of items in "...Jarvis". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Notice the, sort of, "...Zelda"-esque perspective inside the shops. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It's} *actually* one ugly *town*. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 *Oh* yeah, *something else* you can do is you [can *encounter*] a guy who sent you on a *fetch* quest. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Believe [it or not] to find him a *pot*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Taking a page from Western R.P.G.s you can join a guild, where upon you'll switch out your Buzz Lightyear getup, uh, for some sort of a super dorky pseudo-medieval outfit. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess I'll become a fencer. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yeah. Now you're a Viking dude. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, granted, um, I did not play "Mirai Shinwa Jarvas" for very long, but I did get the impression that it is a ［pretty］ *terrible* game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I've now boarded the ship for the second island where I'm *looking* for that *pot*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {For} some reason there's a pot just lying [around on the] ground. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's absolutely amazing how *hateful* the *combat* is in these early Action R.P.G.s 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Valkyrie...", "Hydlide", and *this* game *all suffer* from like *really* bad *combat*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Some people dislike the combat in "Ys". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But seriously, play "...Jarvis" and then play "Ys" and you'll never say anything bad about "Ys" again. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here I've joined the *Mage* Guild, though for some reason I don't seem to have any magic spells. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure how you *get* them. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... But so far Mages seem [pretty] much identical to Vikings. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Other oddities? Well, *buying* [better] weapons *don't seem* [to] *raise* your *attack* stats. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It} was actually *10* after I bought the, uh, more expensive Iron *Spear* (same [as it] was [when I just had that little] *dagger* thing). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I [*didn't*] find [any sort] of *Inn* in the town and *healing [items]* seem* way* too expensive. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I've, uh, *finally* Leveled Up, here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... Another kind of odd concept it takes [from] some [Western R.P.G.s] (like the '*Ultima*' games, [for] example) is [that] you [*don't* sort] of Level Up on the field. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you've gotten enough *Experience Points*, you actually have to *go* and, uh, talk [to] the guy who runs the *guild*, [in] order [to] Level Up. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, there [are] these *really* weird *duels* you [can] fight, um, which *I always* managed [to] lose in [about] one second - and [I'm] *really* [not] sure *why*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 See, [I'm not] really sure [*what*] happened there. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I *believe* these duels [are fought] to *raise* [your] *fame*, which [will] allow ya to [recruit *natives*] who wander [around] on the *overworld*. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... There's some [*interesting*] ??? [actually] *playing* the game is [not] *fun*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, the second I try to enter the next area I was killed instantly. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, Taito has tried to make an Action R.P.G. and failed miserably. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Still, giving this game a try will show you how difficult it was for developers inexperienced in the *genre* [to] make a halfway *playable R.P.G.*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jikai Shounen Mettomag 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 03 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Thinking Rabbit 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by DOG 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Let's start off June 1987 with a very minor F.D.S. game, "Jikai Shounen Mettomag", a game which (much like "Woody Poco") lets you choose your gender. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is the FamiCom debut from the Thinking Rabbit, courtesy of D.O.G. (Square's special F.D.S. label) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 D.O.G. is becoming quite prolific, (this being the fifth game in 1987).🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The title means something like 'Magnetic Field Boy'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though I have no idea what Mettomag is supposed to mean. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's a cute little Puzzle Platformer game, but it does seem to be aimed at younger gamers (or so I gather, based on the simplicity of these early levels). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you may have gathered from watching this video, your character is always in a state of either red or blue polarity. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 While he's blue, the blue objects have an effect on him while the red ones are ignored (and vice versa). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are blue and red spheres which will change his polarity to that color as well as the yellow ones which will simply reverse his color regardless of what he currently is. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Teleportation, there's actually, uh,［pretty］ cool and actually a little horrifying looking. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Most common are the little arrows that will give you a little of extra push in the direction of the arrow. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The downward pointing arrows will make it difficult for you to jump up as they push you down. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The object is to collect every spear in the level and then, uh, find the exit. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is definitely an original idea. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, Thinking Rabbit was known for it's puzzle games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Their 1982 Puzzle Game "Sokoban", was extremely influential and popular. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 We've seen a good number of, sort of, "Sokoban" inspired games released to the FamiCom so far. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, despite the fact that these sorts of games are very popular in Japan (uh, consider how insanely [successful] "Lode Runner" was, for example) I can ［only］ assume this was not a huge smash (at least based on the story of how the D.O.G. label flopped and drove Square to the verge of bankruptcy). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately for Thinking Rabbit they never really seemed to repeat the success of "Sokoban". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This game is vaguely amusing (at least for a little bit) but doesn't really seem to be too special. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Zombie Hunter 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 03 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Lenar 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hi-Score Media Work 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Wow! So how many FamiCom games have not one but two speech samples? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We've actually hardly seen any games try to employ speech. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess that was the big thrill this episode. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And this is "Zombie Hunter". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We are greeted to a very nice fan-translated version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you can enjoy this lengthy title scroll, uh, should you choose to play the game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's one thing that kind of pissed me off about "Zombie Hunter". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 First of all, I've played quite a bit of this and I have yet to see an actual zombie. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not one goddamn zombie in this entire game, nor do you really do any hunting. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Instead, this is, sort of, a typical fantasy style game where you swing your sword and throw fireballs and they have, sort of, various monsters who have names like Gargo and Barus. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, um, the name "Zombie Hunter" seems completely inappropriate. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Something else to be aware of: 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's a manga called "Zombie Hunter" (which involves actual zombies) but has no relation to this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And something else is that this game is developed by Lenar - the same good folks who brought you "Bird Week" and "Deadly Towers" (which was that much derided Action Adventure Game we've covered in "...Episode 13"). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Zombie Hunter" was published by a ［pretty］ unknown, uh, company called Hi-Score Media Work. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They would ［only］ release one other FamiCom game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 That "Deadly Towers" was almost impossibly hard and frustrating, um, and, uh, "Zombie Hunter" tones down that experience quite a bit. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Instead of, uh, huge imposing mazes "Zombie Hunter", uh, has, sort of, flat side-scrolling levels with ［only］ the slightest hint of non-linearity. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The entire game seems to consist of walking forward and killing monsters. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Monsters appear at certain set points in a level killing them will get you experience. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But also, uh, a chest will be dropped. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Usually it just contains Gold, but sometimes an item. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This could be food, uh, medicine, armor, weapons, et cetera. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You will sometimes be given the choice of which path you take, but doesn't really matter because all the levels are, sort of, the same. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This game is not exactly "Castlevania III". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, the thing about the game is that, uh, you don't really know what items certain monsters are going to drop so, uh, you can actually miss out on valuable, uh, items or weapons. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Really, I guess, uh, sort of, to play the game, you, sort of, have to kind of wander back and forth a lot, fighting the same monsters over and over again (Eventually hoping to get, uh, an important weapon upgrade or armor upgrade). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 At the end of each level, you'll battle a Boss but there's really nothing too interesting about these. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's just, sort of, 'run up and hit him until he dies'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, I guess the main problem is "Zombie Hunter" its actually, uh, it's ［pretty］ boring and repetitive - and has some of the most non-descript level design imaginable. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The backgrounds are really plain looking, and the enemies are all just, sort of, generic fantasy monsters. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess a huge chunk of the memory was taken up by those voice samples in the beginning. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... "Zombie Hunter" isn't on a very big cart (［only］ 1.25 megs while a lot of big Adventure Games were on a two meg carts). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, Activision considered releasing this in the U.S., uh, but the title ended up being cancelled. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Activision may currently be the biggest U.S. video game publisher, but back in the late '80s, they were going through a bit of a rough period. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, with its rather simplistic gameplay and, sort of, boring levels, uh, "Zombie Hunter" isn't very good. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, the next game we're going to see is actually a similar idea but much better executed. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Getsufuu Maden 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 07 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This opening explanatory text scroll sets up the story. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You're out to avenge your dead brothers and kill this dragon that's causing all sorts of trouble. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 By the way, this game was released in Japan ［only］, but is now more playable due to a very high-quality English translation patch. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Getsufuu Maden", sort of, resembles "Zelda II..." with the action alternating between top-down overworld sequences and then side-scrolling action sequences. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Takes place on four interconnected islands. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You move around each island by traveling down various paths, and your, uh, route is frequently interrupted by these very short dungeons. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The dungeons are all completely linear. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And all you have to do is simply move from one end to the other (Just like the Warp Zones in "Dr. Chaos"). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Whereas with "Dr. Chaos" you're throwing your controller at the screen in about every 30 seconds, "Getsufuu Maden" is a blast thanks to the silky smooth controls, good hit detection, and all the other hallmarks of Konami quality that make the difference between a good game and an unplayable mess. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Your main weapon is your sword, but you're able {to} buy other weapons, um, enemies will usually drop either cash or their soul will float up and you can collect that, uh, to get some, uh, Hit Points. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Those are those little, sort of, white glowing things {that} look kind of like bombs. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Tops were very similar idea in the, uh -- the 'Ninja-Kun' games. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One other thing that makes this game really cool is, uh, the great graphics and very interesting looking levels.🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Konami was known for good-looking games around this time, uh, but "Getsufuu Maden" certainly lives up to the reputation that was founded on games like 'Castlevania'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just look how cool this level is. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's also a very wide variety of enemies; uh, you're constantly encountering new ones. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And virtually every dungeon is unique looking even though the orcs have very similar layout. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Of course, what would any good Adventure Game in 1987 be without some, sort of, R.P.G. element thrown in? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We use the gold to collect -- to, uh, buy items in the shops (such as health refills, new weapons, among other things). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing you must buy is a sword that can cut through walls. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This special sword is actually necessary in order to get through the game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, as you use your sword, the little sword bar in the upper left-hand corner slowly increases. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As the bar fills up, your attack gets stronger. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Again, this is a ［pretty］ satisfying mechanic; the more you use it, the stronger you get. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh here I'm going to, uh, use the, uh, special sword I bought to break through those walls. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And get this actually -- this very handy projectile weapon which comes in useful against the first, uh, Boss. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, as you can see, now that I've got this new weapon, suddenly these enemies (which were kind of difficult) actually become a lot easier to just go ahead and chew through. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But of course, as you progress enemies get stronger so your, uh, sort of, strength was ［only］ temporary. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Is one of the nice things about this game, sort of, like the constantly changing, sort of, difficulty (you know, you get stronger and then the ene... -- enemies gets stronger). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, to get to an un... -- new island, you actually have to face these, sort of, creepy skull-faced Bosses 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you defeat them they'll give you a pass. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 These guys tend to be ［pretty］ simple and, uh, much like "Castlevania" (or later "Mega Man", I guess) having the right weapon can make a big difference when fighting these Bosses. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In this case, right here, having that projectile weapon, uh, makes things go a lot more smoothly. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now if there is one major flaw in this game it's this, these 3D games sequences. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are three large first person dungeons - quite similar to "Wizardry", um, or those actually found in Konami's own "Ganbare Goemon". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 These sequences are long, there's no map and it's ［pretty］ hard to find a way around these mazes. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is actually probably the most irritating thing in the entire game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you actually get to the end of the labyrinth you'll face one of the major Bosses. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This, right here, seems like, uh, sort of, a little homage to, uh, "Gradius", of all things. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And seriously, look at this guy, a giant, uh, Cyclops Samurai skull guy. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you defeat him you'll obtain one of the, uh, the swords that you're looking for in the game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing about this video, there's sort of like a technical issue, here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... This is actually some of the, uh, the fights in the labyrinth. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game play some sort of weird transparency effect that prevented the video from really capturing these fights correctly. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not really sure how that was even done on a FamiCom, um, but anyway these fights are quite annoying. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And enemies are really hard-to-hit. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You move around the mazes very slowly and the enemies can drain your health quite quickly. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For some reason when you fight the enemies you often miss. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess you can't really tell by looking at these videos here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But these fights are really much more annoying than ［pretty］ much anything else in the game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 While these sequences don't really ruin the game, they are the major flaw in an otherwise great title. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game of occas... -- occasionally, sort of, messes with you a little bit (uh, like that pseudo-boss a second ago there who will give you a pass if you just pester him enough). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One of most striking things in the game are the rather large character portraits you occasionally, uh, see when talking to someone (like that demon there just a moment ago). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Compare these to the way other games have handled, uh, talking N.P.C.s, uh, (for example, '...Zelda' or the 'Dragon Ball' game). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Everything here is so richly detailed. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Konami is interrupting the gameplay for a moment with scenes but -- but they really bring you deeper into the world that the game has created. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, now for a little bit of weirdness: 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well technically an original FamiCom game in Japan the similarity to a 1986 Namco Arcade Game, "Genpei Tōma Den" has been noticed. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 From the character design to that witch that kind of opens up the game there to the look of the levels. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The similarities are rather surprising. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Whether it's a coincidence or not it's really hard to say, but, uh, it is a little bit bizarre. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Even, sort of, like the little Japanese gate that you get at the end of each level is the same. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Genpei Tōma Den" eventually had a FamiCom port, but it was oddly changed into a turn-based R.P.G. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And even, uh, more strangely, the FamiCom port had an overworld that was very similar to that of "Getsufuu..." 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 What's all this mean? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I don't know. I really have no idea. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mentioned some of the, uh, cool power-ups you can buy and this one's quite useful. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's a "Metroid"-like spin attack. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Look this cool Boss; it's actually three ninjas that have joined together some kind of weird, uh, robot creature. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, your overall goal is to find the sword necessary to kill the Final Boss 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's created by, uh, combining three swords together and you have to, sort of, explore several islands and the three labyrinths, fight a Boss at the end of each labyrinth. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you've done all that, you'll find the third sword and they'll be, uh, joined together for, sort of, like the, uh, the super sword (used to kill the -- the dragon Boss). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As I've mentioned before, this game really keeps things fresh. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, you don't really, sort of, see like the same level with the same enemies over and over again. 🍇🍌

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ah! There's the last sword right there. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And you know, once again, there are those weird transparency effects in these cutscenes that simply for whatever reason cannot seem to be captured on this video so you're not really getting the full effect here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You see like the Ghost and his brothers appearing and, uh, their own swords come to merge with his. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Getsufuu..." must hold the record for the most number of skulls and severed heads found in the video game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Really, I mean, they're everywhere in this thing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I can see why this didn't get a U.S. release. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, while "Getsufuu..." is a flawed game in some regards, it is far and away, uh, the game I like the most this episode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And is the, sort of, game I would hope Konami would make after "Castlevania", and is very much a foul to follow-up in the style to the first "Castlevania" game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And despite those horrible elaborate scenes, the game really drew me in in a way that a lot of games of this era do not. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... For example, the fantastic graphics. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... This must be about the best looking games for the FamiCom so far. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The music, the easiest controls, the completely badass Final Boss. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, just look at that thing! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 How many sprites do we have on the screen here at once? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Getsufuu..." really stands head [and] shoulders above so much crap on the system (like "Zombie Hunter", for example). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I really can't recommend it strongly enough. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and something about virtually every single Konami game (be at "Castlevania", or "Green Beret" or whatever) it always ends with the bad guys base blowing up. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's a common theme. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I wonder how our, uh, hero managed to get out of that alive. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Konami really seems to be on a roll about this time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Consider that about one month after this game, they released "Metal Gear" for the M.S.X. 2. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And while get "Getsufuu Maden" is not nearly as historic or groundbreaking as "Metal Gear", in its own right it is a very good game and definitely an undiscovered gem. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Booby Kids 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 July 10 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nichibutsu 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nichibutsu 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Guy looks like he's having some sort of seizure. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We close out this episode with "Booby Kids" - perhaps the most unfortunately named FamiCom game we've seen so far. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 With a title like that, you really have no idea what to expect in the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Some sort of early age game? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, no, uh, I guess 'Booby Kids' [is just] one [of] those weird random English *phrases* [the] Japanese occasionally [*employ*] (unless the developers thought 'Booby' [and] 'Bomb' were somehow [*related*]). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Japanese doesn't have a sound like the 'mb' at the end of 'bomb' so I guess *[it] could* be. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Or maybe they were thinking of *booby traps* because {of} the holes you dig [to] trap enemies *in*? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 *Well, either* way "*Booby Kids*" is, [sort] of, a cross [between] "*Lode Runner*" [and] "*Bomberman*". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Just like] "*Lode* Runner", [your] goal is [to collect the] various [*objects*] scattered [around] a *level (here* it's some [sort] of *fruit*). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 *All the [while]*, you avoid enemies, [but] you [can delay] enemies by digging a *hole* [into] which they [might] *fall*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Once] ya collect all the [*objects*], the *entrance* [will] open up. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 *There [are]* various sorts of obstructions, walls, and whatnot {to} [prevent] you from reaching all the *areas*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you [will] need to utilize warps, springboards, *and (of* course) *bombs* ([at least that's what the] game *calls* them). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... [When] you [actually] *employ* them [they look, sort of, like] dynamite [sticks]. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here I've reached the second level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I'm going to find some hidden bombs in a moment. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's right, bombs aren't something you can just see on the playing field; you have just happen to wander in to the square where they're hidden. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The explosions when you set off a bomb actually greatly resemble those of "Bomberman". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And they can even be used to kill nearby enemies. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However, here's the thing: your supply is limited so you will need to find the hidden bombs in each level before you can get all the items and escape the level. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There is some sort of plot here, I suppose. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game has a time-travelling theme. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Here's one of the issues. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Don't really know where to set off the bombs. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Trying to break into that little area, but ［only］ one square is actually bombable. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And because there's a limited number of bombs, well, you know, that's really not fair when you think about it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, about the plot of the game, uh, you start off in, sort of, this prehistoric world, uh, but eventually you end up travelling forward in time, with the dinosaurs and the cavemen being replaced by samurais, and robots, that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are definitely some irritating moments in this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here, ya need to [get across] [to], uh, [to] that [little *island* in the] *middle* [and] grab all the, uh, [fruit] *there*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But [how do ya get to] that one *separate* isle? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The bridge [doesn't] go all the way [*across*]. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, as [it] turns out, ya have [to] dig a *hole* in *front* of the *bridge*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That will somehow *extend* [it]. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 [That's *not] exactly*, uh, the [most] logical *thing*. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, ya [*wouldn't*] really normally *think* [of] that. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ah! There we *go*! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Booby Kids" is from Nihon Bussan a.k.a. Nichibutsu (the same guys who gave us "Terra Cresta" [and] "Crazy *Climber*"). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is their first foray [into] console games, and [it's *not*] a bad *start*, uh, [but] "Booby Kids" is [not exactly] original *nor* [is it] really [that] *enjoyable*. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Ya might not really] think of Nichibutsu [as] being, like, [an] active *company* still [but] they *are* [still *around*]. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though they *seem* {to} be mostly making things like, uh, Mahjong Games, [and] Quiz Games, [and] those [sorts of] things [intended *strictly* for] a Japanese audience. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 19 Wrap Up ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 *Okay*, so "*Booby Kids*" [wasn't exactly] the best way to end [an] episode, [but I'll] make [it] up [to] ya. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "*Chrontendo* Episode 20" [is] gonna [start *out*] with a *game* [that] a [*lot] of* you [*probably*] remember [and] love. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, check back *soon* [and] keep your eyes peeled for a new episode of '*Chronsega*' [as] well. 🍇🍌
