👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 33 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright "...Episode 33" is here and it's going to be a bit shorter than last time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm sure you're grateful for that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what's up? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How about more Japanese-style Adventure Games and a couple Baseball Games and a seriously irritating Platformer from VIC TOKAI. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But don't get the wrong idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...Episode 33" is a very solid episode because (that...) we have four (that's right, four) great games from Capcom, Namco, Konami, and Technos Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's get going. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jarinko Chie: Bakudan Musume no Shiawase Sagashi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've got a few Adventure Games this time around, starting with "Jarinko Chie: Bakudan Musume no Shiawase Sagashi" from Konami. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one came out just three weeks after Konami's last Adventure Game (the one with the reason Tachibana). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this is (not surprisingly) Based on a manga character from the long-running during ko chia manga by utsumi harookie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's known as 'chia, the brat' in English. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a humorous stories about a young girl and her dysfunctional family and the restaurant that they run. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also been like some anime spin-offs, but nothing in particular, it was running at this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike Bandai, Konami apparently doesn't release games to coincide with some T.V. show or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's probably not necessary to talk about all these games in great depth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But for this one, suffice to say it's very similar to the Japanese Metro games we've seen already. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have commands for move, look, take hit talk, use normal stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Characters from the manga make their appearances. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, for example, you're a cat who you think To. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You seem to be stuck in the restaurant as the game opens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to take care of (I think it's) your grandfather in order to proceed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can find a bottle of cider and give it to them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And eventually you'll be able to exit the restaurant and enter town. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this looks like a [pretty] high-quality game, as we would expect from Konami. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The characters are well drawn, and the backgrounds all have that sort of Konami feel to them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later on, you're actually playing some minigames. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So superficially at least this looks [pretty] decent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's [pretty] big contrast to the next Adventure Game today, which we'll see in a few minutes. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Best Play Pro Yakyuu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ASCII 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So last episode, I said I'm getting tired of all these damn Baseball Games and As punishment for my hubris, the universe is made the next game today a Baseball Game, "Best Play Pro Yakyuu" from ASCII. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 ASCII being a Computer Game publisher that put a lot of [pretty] oddball selection of games so far - mostly computer ports. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know what this screen is for, but this is gonna be the most boring screen in any video game ever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, they stick to, sort of, their game plan here, since "Best Play Pro Yakyuu" is the latest in long-running series of Baseball Games from ASCII, which started back in 1985. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This right here is one of the other ones: "new best nine Baseball" P.C.-88 version of the first game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note the option for each team to be either a 'Computer' or 'Man' (meaning played by a real person). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, technically you can have the computer play all the teams on this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see, this thing is more like a Baseball league Simulation Game rather than a typical "Family Stadium" type game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's all about managing teams. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here the teams are. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can play with all the details, change the names, whether you want to be played by computer or yourself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here are the individual team members. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They have a lot of different stats and have been graded on many different aspects of their playing capabilities. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Same with pitchers Over on the right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is stats on things like pitching stability, technique, stamina, and really all sorts of stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And rearrange the team do trades keeps track of your performance, all kinds of interesting features, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's really like a Baseball Game for geeks basically. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now one very notable thing was the box art. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was drawn by Susumu Matsushita, a [pretty] high profile illustrator who (among other things) designed Neppy, the mascot for the Orix Buffaloes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another famous character of his his necchi, the mascot for Famitsu magazine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And speaking of Famitsu, if you remember that readers poll we discussed a while ago, "Best Play Pro Yakyuu" came in at number 72, which is a couple entries above "Resident Evil 4", if you can believe that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is not just some weird long-forgotten Baseball Game we're talking about, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As for the actual Baseball-playing part of the game, it involves very little player input compared to something like "Family Stadium". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, I think the team stats are central to the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can even set all the teams that be played by the C.P.U. and focus entirely on team management. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, a slightly updated version was released a few months down the road, in October - the 'new data' edition of "Best Play..." came out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe that some of the stats were juggled around a bit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, this is definitely very different than the other Baseball Games we've covered so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's an interesting step towards today's management-heavy Sports Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, we're not very interested in old Japanese Baseball teams is probably going to actually have very little interest for you. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mr. Gold - Kinsan in the Space 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 April 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toei 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This opening is so great. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm just gonna have to let it go without comment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can just totally sing along with this music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...look of the good looks..."? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, just what exactly the hell is this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I wish I knew. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Mr. Gold - Kinsan in the Space" is Adventure Game from Toei. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally it's based on the cartoon of theirs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the song is from the cartoon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However the name "...Kinsan in ... Space" kind of tips us off to the origins of this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, Mr. Gold has its roots in a historical person (a samurai) named Toyama Kaga Moto - or Toyama can Shiro, as he was also called. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Over the years, a fictionalized version of him (under the name Toyama No Kingsun) appeared in various forms of popular entertainment, including any number of movies and T.V. shows. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's depicted as a crime busting Samurai with a cherry blossom tattooed on his shoulder. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1988, till we put out a directivity automate called "Toyama Sakura mucho yacht sued no one a Gold" (meaning 'Toyama Cherry Blossom, Space Commander: His name is Gold') known in the West as "Samurai Gold". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just the two Yamato Kings character setting the future (the boring future). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To decide being a Science-Fiction theme game, you spend all your time doing rather mundane, non-futuristic stuff, like shopping for caramels at the kiosk and driving around in your car. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's not even a space car; It drives on regular old roads. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya Enter the coordinates where you want to travel to, which often leads to a dead end. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes you'll get a fight with this guy with a lightsaber, but nothing really seems to happen, as far as I can tell. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, you can actually get a list of all the interesting locations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mostly you just go and look around and talk to people. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I didn't really encounter any aliens or robots or spaceships in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know if it ever gets exciting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I checked a walk through and it's incredibly short! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I guess I'm just gonna have to chalk this up as being another crappy game from Toei. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hitler no Fukkatsu: TOP SECRET 🇯🇵 // Bionic Commando 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 20 🇯🇵 // 1988 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here it is the one you've been waiting for. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Capcom having proved their chops with "Mega Man" decides to take another go at creating a classic console game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Hitler no Fukkatsu: Top Secret" (or 'Hitler's Resurrection: Top Secret'). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Comms turns up Golden State's plan to somehow bring Hitler back to life in order to get the plans for some top secret Nazi super weapon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now we know this game in the West as "Bionic Commando". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not [only] was the name changed, but due to Nintendo of America, its policies avoiding anything even vaguely controversial in their games. All references to Nazis and Hitler were changed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Hitler was called Master D. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And some minor tweaks were made to the levels in a few places as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, the swastika being replaced with like the eagle logo that happens [pretty] much everywhere in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, it just so happens that today we have a hacked version of "Bionic Commando" that puts all the censored stuff back into the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you'll be seeing the game with full Nazi content, basically. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Makes it resemble the original Japanese version a bit more, though it's still the American version However. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the plot here is Super Joe (the guy from visual "Commando" game) has been kidnapped. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You lads, man Sir, (the guy with the robotic arm) must infiltrate the bad guys territory and fix everything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the main selling point of buying a "Commando" is, of course, the robotic arm. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see, sprinter cannot jump; he must use his arm to climb and swing from platform to platform. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Bionic Commando" has beginnings in the 1987 Arcade Game called "top secret" in Japan, and "Bionic Commando" in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade version is not too terribly well-known and it's very different from the console game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it's not even really clear whether the home version is a heavily revived report or a sequel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, the home version is far superior to the Arcade original. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So for this, Capcom did the whole R.P.G./"...Zelda" thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You collect objects to increase your Life Bar, you will need to seek out weapons upgrades, accessories, and strengthen yourself, and also communications radios in order to advance. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is somewhat non-linear in certain level can be skipped or played out of order. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You often encounter these radio room where if you have the right communicator, you can engage in "Metal Gear"-like conversations with headquarters or listen to any radio chatter under wiretapping, which is not always very useful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No Spencer is on rather large but suspiciously with the gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game's real meat and potatoes is using the arm. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One venue want to pick up our little bullets that enemies drop. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Good enough and you'll increase your maximum number of Hit Points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Levels are [pretty] linear, and each ends with these control rooms, which houses a "main system". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's always someone defending this room - a bunch of soldiers or some sort of boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After blowing up your health refill to the maximum, you'll get 10 bonus bullets, and new weapon or accessory. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now between levels a move around on this screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The white Square's are the regular levels and the red ones are the neutral zones. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The white lines show the paths you can move in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your site enter a level you can take one weapon one communicator a couple other items with you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here's the neutral zone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The function kind of like villages and "Zelda II...". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 See soldiers walking around, but no one will attack you unless you attack first. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The [only] purpose here is to enter a couple of buildings and get some items (Sometimes extra bullets or a weapon or accessory or communicator). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously these neutrals aren't are not terribly exciting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now hopefully got the hang of the controls on the first two levels. Since around the third level, things pick up considerably. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Flying in these graphs you instantly can't shoot up, they're [pretty] difficult to eliminate. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mostly they get in your way to try to climb this incredibly tall tower. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when you do kill one, they respond immediately. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it seems like you always have one or two buzzing around your head. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now as you get further up, there's a series of very tricky climb that you'd have to like hell yourself up and rebel, another platform and then air. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And all these paratroopers falling down just to add to the misery. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of the larger the regular bosses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily this guy is [pretty] easy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (All the bosses are, actually). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Bionic Commando: Rearmed" (the modern day remake), sort of, changed all the bosses to make better use of the bionic arm But mostly here he just, sort of, shooting while dodging. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now originality is a key part of the game's success. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're always seeing things you've never really encountered in other games (like this sewer level) but the blue slime coming in the pipes will carry you away, so you, sort of, be constantly moving and jumping. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By now I've been part of the rocket launcher, which will make short work of these guys driving the cranes, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, it should be mentioned bionic endo is hard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The grappling and swinging mechanic parts very precise timing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you often find you have to grapple another platform while you're still in midair. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the best place to grab something and the exact timing required is not always clear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It requires a lot of practice and experimentation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first time you go through a level like this, you're never really sure it's going to appear while you're flying the air. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, there were a difficult series of jobs, right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no way you could possibly get through this trouble the first time you try that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, as a rule, when dealing with enemies, often speed is key. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather than waiting for enemies to appear and harass us or to keep one step ahead by always moving. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Standing their ground and trying to fight them in situations where what until they start appearing is usually too tall because they just keep respawning over and over again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And "Bionic Commando" means Rarely lets you catch your breath, so to speak. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each level brings something new, like spikes, fire lasers, new enemies, like these crazy guys who were little helicopter things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The [only] real repetition in the game are the neutral levels and the boss encounters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also these strange little "Commando"-like levels where you have to run around the top-down setting and shoot guys. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When they're very, very easy and boring, but they're also very short. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One way eventually you'll find Super Joe (or "Mr. Joe" as you call him) and he spills the whole story to you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namely, the Imperial Army discovered these tops secret plans for a super laser weapon called albatross. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It turns out that [only] Adolf Hitler knows how to make the albatross. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So they're bringing him back to life. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How they are doing this, it never explained. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, they could clone him, but the clone wouldn't know anything about the super laser. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, once you reach Level 12 (the final level - which is like, uh, swastika city) the wacky plot comes to an exciting conclusion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And really "Bionic Commando" must have about the best last level we've seen on a game so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to, uh, start by entering this base here then have to blow up some power supplies or to take down these electric barriers, be going up and down the elevators, that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll reach general kill it who's been the main bad guy so far who apparently explains that they somehow finished the albatross without Hitler. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So now they're going to switch off the Hitler reviving machine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But he didn't plan on Hitler's powers of lightning. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And despite just now being brought back to life, Somehow knows exactly what's going on and plants take over the world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then he actually sticks the albatross on you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the whole scene of Hitler, sort of, emerging from the tank is actually [pretty] cool. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If I mentioned the whole ending of this game is [pretty] much non-stop awesomeness. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the albatross is what exactly some sort of floating ship? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We need to climb up to the top and repeatedly shoot that little orange weak spot there while avoiding the many jets of flames. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now once you finally destroyed it, is it Game Over? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No! you still have to kill Hitler! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After a moment you'll run into this goofball, Hal, to dimension on radio communications a few times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that seems it is [only] getting quality is that he has a bazooka. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now wait a minute, a bazooka? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You already have a rocket launcher. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What do you need a bazooka for? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well anyway, and one final 'screw you', Capcom makes you try to shoot the helicopter in the cockpit as you're falling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You [only] have basically timing to get one shot if you miss you die. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, when you finally get it you are treated to what has been the most gruesome death in any N.E.S. game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a look. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You blow it up, there's Hitler. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, Geez! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rewind that if you didn't catch that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hitler goes through a three stage face explosion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So now is the game over? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, now the beta is exploding and you've got to get out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even encounter one of the earlier robot bosses along the way And then of course, it's dramatic ending time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So bionic man who gets many points for sheer originality. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from the very unusual swing mechanic, it's one of those games where you don't really feel like you've already played it 100 times before. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It always feels fresh and exciting (Aside from a few rough spots, like the neutral zone is) it's constantly keeping you on your toes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now I do have some complaints. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It can be very difficult certain jobs take a lot of practice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When the penalty for doing a jump wrong is death Well, that can be very frustrating. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And just like "Blaster Master", the game really should have passwords or safe states. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not something you really want to play in just one sitting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So overall, "Bionic Commando" is a fantastic, very cool game that gets almost everything right. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's, sort of, funny thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It turns out the narrator so to speak, is Super Joe writing his autobiography, which he dates August 2010 (by some weird coincidence, just a couple months before we ourselves are doing this show here). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if you've never played "Bionic Commando", definitely give it a shot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the finest titles we've seen so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Maison Ikkoku 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Microcabin | Quest | Roman-Tech 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bothtec 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, after We have something a little less exciting, "Maison Ikkoku", from bowtech - another Adventure Game Based on a manga and animated series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, the original manga was created by a comic artist probably well-known to many of you guys out there, Rumiko Takahashi. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 She's best known for the 'oosa yetzirah' and 'Rondo One half' comics. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We saw [pretty] lame 'you were say yetzirah' game from Jaleco back in 1986 - that "Lum no wedding Bell" (a.k.a. "mocha 120%"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Maison Ikkoku" is a romantic-themed story about the residents of a boarding house. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main characters are a college student, named Usaku gotei, and the young widowed manager of the house, Kyoko otonashi. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game first appeared on Japanese computers in 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, we mentioned it in our "History of Adventure Games" thingy just two episodes ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom version was apparently ported by Quest and Roman tech, who seemed to have ties to bowtech. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now I'm not going to spend too much time discussing this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'But Dr. Sparkle', you complain, 'Why not? I don't care about bionic command or "Super Dodgeball". I want to know about "Maison Ikkoku"!'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, in 1989 it gets ported again to the P.C. Engine and published by Micro Cabin themselves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That version, aside from having prettier graphics, has also unofficially been translated into English. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we're going to come back to it in a future episode of 'Chronturbo'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the time being, be aware of the stories about gotye learning about a mysterious photograph that Kyoko has, and he wants to find out what the photo is of. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Very exciting, I'm sure! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Quest of Ki 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Game Studio 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! the good old Namco logo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the first of two games, this time around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First up is "The Quest of Ki". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually a [pretty] good little intro sequence on this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is sometimes called "kind of boeken". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But since the title screen in the box aren't actually say "The Quest of Ki" that's what I'm going to call it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The most there are games to do percent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game was designed by Masanobu Endô's Game Studio. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ooh! That picture looks kind of dirty, right there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This intro explains the whole plot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's very important blue crystal rod was captured by the evil Drago who lives, in a tower. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, the bottom line is the chi needs to enter dragas Tower under the orders of the goddess Ishtar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might have realized is a sequel (or rather a prequel) to "Tower of Druaga" the Namco Arcade game that recieved a FamiCom port back in 1985, as covered way, way, way back in "Chrontendo Episode 4". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kai was the lady that you were trying to rescue in that game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here you play as her. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then 1987 the Arcade sequel appeared, "the return of Ishtar". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Looks a bit more friendly than the first game - I'm on, sort of, got one ask. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A few more games have come out since then. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even got him a serious dungeon came back on the PlayStation 2. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So how does quest Kai turn out? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, [pretty] weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Let's take a look. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the first two games, this one uses the side perspective. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You grab the key, go to the door, and... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow! That's gotta be the shortest video game level ever! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's, like, the easiest 4700 points I've ever earned. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So each level has a key and a door, and treasure chest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The chest is often, sort of, like a hard to read, sort of, spot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing about "..Quest of Ki" - there is really weird jumping. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's almost like I said in zero gravity. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can jump up above until you hit your head and then you plummet straight down. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can control the directory of your jump a bit while in the air but still, everything's like, sort of, moving in slow motion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Oops, accidentally touched the enemy there.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All this can make it [pretty] difficult to avoid enemies which move at normal speed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And is very difficult to control how high you're jumping. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even lightly tapping into jump button might cause a jump higher than you want. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And unfortunately, you have no weapon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The A button instead allows you to run, thus decreasing your time and a lead giving you a higher score. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each level has a timer on it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, the chairs contain things like points, extra time, warps to other levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What I really want, however, is a sword. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, that'd be much easier to like kill enemies as opposed to having to like jump over them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All together, there are 100 levels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...Quest of Ki" is, sort of, weird for a 'Druaga' game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It doesn't really bear any resemblance to the first two, other than the whole 'tower' concept. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I'd say unless this gets a whole lot more fun later on, I would skip it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kakefu Kun no Jump Tengoku: Speed Jigoku 🇯🇵 // Kid Kool 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 22 🇯🇵 // 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by VIC TOKAI 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by VIC TOKAI 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next we have "Kakefu Kun no Jump Tengoku: Speed Jigoku" from VIC TOKAI (or as we like, come over here "Kid Kool"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least they kept the double 'K' in the name. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last game we saw from VIC TOKAI was the "Goebel 13" game - an interesting game, but quite flawed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The same could be said of "Kid Kool". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, first of all, about the Japanese version: 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Capricorn is (shockingly) a real person - a child actor named Sagara Kenji, who is (among other things) a cast member of a show called 'to call Roseanne no Tata mono de Haan I'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was hosted by Coco George. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ko rose already had his own game, a terrible piece of kusoge called "taco rose and no mama Romo of Senna Romo". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We covered it in "...Episode 19". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Capricornus pictured on the box art for this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously the character has changed whether U.S. release. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Kid Kool" starts with this great intro, which (along with that of "Master Blaster") has got to be a funniest damn thing we've seen on the N.E.S. so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is quite cool and has plenty of attitude. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The plot is that the King is ill and needs cool go out and collect the seven herbs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmm. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now I think we all know exactly what's really going on, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, come on, the King is 'ill' and needs his 'herbs'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, just look at that guy and tell me he's not stoner. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well "Kid Kool" appears to be a cute little Mario so hop up in first glance. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Except that instead of making a fun little happy game "Super Mario Bros.", VIC TOKAI seems to do really crafted evil vile exercise and gamer torture. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First time you play this you almost certainly die in about 20 seconds. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see, "Kid Kool" looks like "Super Mario Bros." but feels nothing like it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, there's no Run button for the kid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Playing someone like Janda jet turbine up is bud. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He starts off running very slowly and then quickly jumps up to warp speed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 He also has quite a bit of momentum and is difficult to stop (something you'll realize later on smack dab into a group of enemies for the first time). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another problem: take a look at the vertical scrolling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 VIC TOKAI apparently couldn't figure out how to do smooth vertical scrolling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, everything freezes as the screen scrolls up and then starts again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The swing often scrolls when you're jumping on higher platforms - meaning at the apex of your jump you won't be able to see the platform you're trying to land on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It makes jumping even that much more difficult. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No on the positive note, when you continue your game, you will be treated to this hilarious cutscene. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kool actually comes back in Angel form. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He seems to be taking the whole death thing [pretty] well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "I guess I died.". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Very observant! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The King just nonchalantly brings him back to life, which earns us, well, "Thanks." I'm cool. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When it comes to jumping, jump up One and a half times his body length moving slowly - or entire screen length when he's going fast. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And his jumps are very hard to control. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're probably going to be many instances when you need to make a short simple jump, and you end up falling short. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And virtually impossible to like turn around in mid-jump if you realize you aren't going to make it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Throw a lot of jumps are very easy in Mario or "Adventure Island" or in most Platformers but they're way difficult to "Kid Kool". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now a year later Victor Kai greatly improved on this formula for a game called "Psycho Fox" released on the Sega Master System. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While it's not a remake or anything like that It does borrow quite a bit from "Kid Kool" and fixes the controls and jumping issues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Decap attack" would be another even better take on "Kid Kool". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another problem here: blind jumps; there are so many blind jumps. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last level even start to out on a long blind jump on a floor covered with spikes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are so many things we have to pick up speed goes sailing across the screen and On some wildtype platform one screen to the right - or one screen down. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's so much memorization involved in this game, which is a shame because the levels lines are actually quite inventive! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're just also completely frustrating. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So naturally there are bosses at the end of each world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last boss is [pretty] easy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You said jump on one of those bounce blocks, jump on his head, and then land on the bounce block again when he's past. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, watching this video it doesn't really look that hard but when you play your character feels like he's like walking wasted the mud for a moment - then suddenly takes off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It makes it really difficult to get the hang of the controls. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And levels are designed to try to kill you over and over. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like the boss at VIC TOKAI said, 'hey, I hear this Mario game is really popular. Someone go out and get a copy we'll make your own version.'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the guy he said brought back "...Mario ... 2" by mistake (you know, the Japanese one). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And everyone at VIC TOKAI was like, 'People are playing games like this and they like it? Well, we'll just give them what they want!'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a shame because with an easier control scheme, this game could be a lot of fun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As it stands is like an exercise in pure gaming frustration. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Konami Ice Hockey 🇯🇵 // Blades of Steel 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 22 🇯🇵 // 1988 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our second Konami game this episode was released in Japan for the F.D.S. under the name "Konami Ice Hockey". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why they didn't call this thing 'Exciting Hockey' is anybody's guess. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But as we know, Konami retired the 'Exciting Sports' name. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this was, in fact, a port of Konami's 1987 Arcade Game, "Blades of Steel". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, why didn't call the F.D.S. version "Blades of Steel", I mean, who knows what's the better name "Konami Ice Hockey" or "Blades of Steel"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which would you buy? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game was essentially the Hockey version of "Double Dribble" and featured tons of excellent-sounding speech. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, this was released in the U.S. under the no more familiar name of "Blades of Steel". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. release was December 1988. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The move to cartridge meant Konami could throw in some fancy speech samples which actually were not there in the F.D.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It is, of course, not quite in the same league as the Arcade Game, but it's actually is still [pretty] impressive! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you choose your team League, whether you want to play one game or tournament, and there can be one or two players. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now perhaps the most well-known feature and "Blades of Steel" is fighting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Essentially almost like a little mini Fighting Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Smacking into one of your opponent's a few times in a row will cause the Fighting Game to start up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can punch high low or block - and the loser gets hit the penalty box. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will give you like a one player advantage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it can be done twice, meaning you can have up to five men on the ice and the other team [only] have three, which definitely gives you an advantage when playing the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So fighting is not just for fun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually very useful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the game is [pretty] simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The player you are controlling flashes (much like in "Double Dribble"), the B button passes to a teammate, and A shoots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When defending, the player you are controlling is automatically selected on who's closest to the puck. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now in the past, I've complained quite a bit about Sports Games where the control player switches around automatically but "Blades of Steel" actually does it very well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When the other team makes a shot towards your goal, you automatically take control over the goalie and block the shot and then you can pass it back to one of your own players. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each game is divided into three 20 minute periods in which the clock goes much faster than real-time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the periods are in real life [only] a few minutes each. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 During an emissions, you'll see the players skate around the bed or sometimes they'll get like a little minigame, or actually even an ad for comic games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's like early in-game advertising, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you win, your players will remain on the ice and do a little victory dapps - except for the goalie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He can never leave his post, for some reason, even after the game's over! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Poor guy.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's really all there is to "Blades of Steel". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Into simple game, but it's [pretty] much a bit sports at its finest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For old-school hochanda doesn't really get much better than this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting that two of the better sports teams for the FamiCom and N.E.S. have been both Hockey Games (Nintendo's "Ice Hockey" and this). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While Hockey is not the most popular sport in real life, It does make for some [pretty] good video games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nekketsu Koukou Dodge Ball Bu 🇯🇵 // Super Dodge Ball 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 26 🇯🇵 // 1989 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Technos Japan 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Technos Japan 🇯🇵 // CSG 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 July 26th has two great games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First, let's take a look at one from Technos Japan, "Nekketsu Koukou Dodge Ball Bu" a spin-off of the Nekketsu High School game (a.k.a. "Renegade"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems that Kunio and his friends have turned their aggression to more socially acceptable ends, throwing rubber balls at each other as opposed to beating each other up in the streets. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is the first in a series of not very realistic Sports Games based on the Nekketsu High School and Kunio Kun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, this game was first released in Arcades. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the West, it was on a "Super Dodgeball", the "Renegade" connection was not really obvious, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original pictures rather large, more powerful players. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose those are supposed to be Kunio Kun, himself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now for the N.E.S. release, Technos went with the original "Super Dodgeball" name. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A few changes were made like this superior title screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And your team is American rather than Japanese. So those two tape stages have been switched. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the U.S. we got stuck with some rather ugly cover. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there are three modes: World Cup (meaning tournament), 2-Player versus mode, and then Bean Ball (which is like a single game dodgeball brawl). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously the gigantic team member has been dropped because The N.E.S. can't make sprites that big. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And he [only] have six players on the team: three on the inner court and three on the outer court. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object is to knock all three members out from the other teams in our court. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So where exactly is this game taking place? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Statue of Liberty is between you and Manhattan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So maybe this is Staten Island? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nice. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, How's this game work? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can either throw the ball at an opposing team member or pass it to your own team. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It can be hit one or the other team players you'll do some damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, if they catch the ball, they'll have control and they can throw it back at you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, when it does hit a player, the ball will usually land and that player is in our court, meaning they can grab the ball throw it at you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a variety of axes your player can make including a power shot or the ball glows and usually does major damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And once the players Power Bar has been completely emptied, they die. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And yes, they appear to actually die in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since you can see them turn into an Want to fly off to Heaven? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, this is really just as brutal as Renegade. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead of killing with your fists, you beat people to death with a rubber ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You win the championship not by playing fairly, like killing every team that stands in your way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really! Why do the authorities allowed us to continue? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, once you've literally slaughtered the other team and move on to the U.K., then India, Iceland, Kenya, China, Japan, and the USSR? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The weirdest thing is dodgeball Here is the pigeon, sort of, a popular enough sport to have like these international competitions between what I guess our High School teams. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 May nowadays understand there is some competitive dodgeball, but when I was younger, it was simply a crazy game played in the school yard by young kids. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Outnumber in whatever playing it after the sixth grader so. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't even really remember the rules quite frankly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seemed just like kids, you know, throwing balls together, especially it's more chaotic variation smear the queer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Went away, there was not too much explanation required of this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's quite a few moves you have running, jumping, jumping throws, super shots, jumping, super shots, catching, ducking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each opposing team has different strengths. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you might need to vary your tactics up a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You want to focus on the super shots from the inner court or have your outer court pound them with jumping shots. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, despite the technical issues, there's tons of flicker due to all the sprites on the screen at once. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Super Dodgeball" is (unlike most Sports Games we've seen so far) tons of fun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It stands as one of the best 8-bit Sports Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you really can't beat the simplicity of trying to hit people with rubber balls, I guess. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Rainbow Islands 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 26 🇯🇵 // 1991 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito | Disco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Man! Namco, Capcom, Konami, Technos, and now Taito! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole gang is here today! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is actually a good one from Taito: "Rainbow Islands" program by disco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who are disco? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Don't know. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some internal division of Taito? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Their name appears on a few FamiCom Taito games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Only] the U.S. version doesn't even mention them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, "Rainbow Islands" is the sequel to "Bubble Bobble", despite the fact that Bub and Bob aren't really even in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead, you play as Bubby and Bobby which I guess are the human versions of Bob and Bob (who were dragons). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this of course, was ported from the 1987 Arcade Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's funny, it seems like half the games from the "1987 Arcade Round-Up" are getting home versions in this episode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now "Rainbow Islands" is similar in structure to "Bubble Bobble". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your [only] weapon is something even less likely to kill you than bubbles; It's rainbows. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, the game turns rainbows into deadly weapons, and the rainbow is double as a little bridges as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there are two ways to cruelly snuff out a life using a rainbow. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A direct attack (simply hitting any of the rainbow). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or (even better) building a rainbow above an enemy and then jumping on it, causing it to fall and land on the enemy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this we're usually cause them to drop special items (mostly diamonds, but also some power-ups). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They move vertically up the level, just like "Bubble Bobble" but here there are multiple screens before you reach the levels and. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then a giant chest opens up and will spit out some items worth points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's odd that for a point base game you can't see your score except between levels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there you go! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eat world has a standard four levels and there are seven worlds sort of. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now as I mentioned, oh than diamonds you can get power-ups, including hoops to make move faster and the power to cast double rainbows. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'What's that?' You say 'Double rainbows?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "It's a double rainbow all the way! Whoa! It's so intense!". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, double rainbows are [pretty] cool. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're longer - and thus will give you more reach when you shoot them towards the enemy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now one thing you can shoot a rainbow that wraps around the screen but you can't actually move off the edge wrap around yourself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still the rainbow wrapping power does come Handy at times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you see the word Rainbow is partially spelled out there on the left-hand side. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For each color of diamond you collect the letter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object is to collect one of each color and spell Rambo completely. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Doing so give us a big special diamond when that world's boss - which is a big spider, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy turns out to be [pretty] easy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you click the big diamond News World, you'll travel to the hidden eighth world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's really eight worlds on rainbow Island. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Interestingly, the Arcade Game had a whopping three in islands. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And each level has a theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first is insect theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Can we have like a military themed violin. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Box for this level is a giant helicopter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later on, there's a robot Island and (as video game companies like putting crossovers in their games) there's an arco level and a darious themed level in space. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite the cute and cuddly appearance, "Rainbow Islands" gets quite difficult later levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The robot level is full of "Mega Man"-like spikes require very careful placement of rainbows To avoid hitting spikes (to often use rainbow stepping stones to higher platforms). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in the "Arkanoid" in various levels or clumps of flying enemies and projectile throwing enemies that make up a really rough going. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This series went on to become one of titles biggest when it came to ports and sequels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game was released on virtually every platform known to man. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And title continues put a rainbow Island games for the D.S. and we were and the like. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is definitely one of the better cutesy Arcade style Platformers for the N.E.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But still part of the game's appeal is the bright colors (not mentioned the adorable graphics). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is even about rainbows and for God's sake and the FamiCom cannot even reproduce a proper rainbow. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These have [only] red yellow and like a bluish green stripe. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Regardless, I still highly recommend it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taito's track record with FamiCom hasn't exactly been fantastic so far, but this is one that really takes top prize. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Great Tank 🇯🇵 // Iron Tank 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 29 🇯🇵 // 1988 July [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SNK 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by SNK 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 SMK makes another rare appearance on the FamiCom last thing we saw from them was the horrendous "Ikari Warriors II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now it's "Iron Tank" (although the logo makes it look more like 'Chrome Tank'). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Japan This is called "Great Tank". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Course Why would you make a tank out of iron? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shouldn't they be made something stronger like steel? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also very puzzled on the physics involved when this transport gets blown up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bomb was traveling faster than the bomber? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bomber dropped the bomb and slow way down? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well anyway, This is supposedly based on the invasion of Normandy (which, as you recall, was spearheaded by a single tank). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Iron Tank" is a standard Run-'n'-Gun or Roll-'n'-Gun, I guess would be more accurate. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Machine gun which always fires the same direction or pointed and a turret which can be turned in any of the eight directions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Looks a lot like the tanks in "Ikari Warriors".) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, in fact, "Iron Tank" is, sort of, gussied up port of a 1985 Arcade title, called "T.N.K III" in the U.S. and "T.A.N.K." in other parts of the world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This came out one year before "Ikari...", and (in the Japanese version, at least) your character is one of the 'Ikari' guys. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Ikari..." is essentially the sequel to "Tank III" (I'm not even sure how you're supposed to pronounce that - "T.N.K"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It used the same rotary joystick as "Ikari Warriors". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this leads to the game's major problem: moving your tanks turret. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You do so by holding down the B button but tires machine gun and then using the D-Pad to change the direction the turret is pointing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not exactly a fantastic solution. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When a tank or enemy suddenly appears and want to take him out He told me to stop, hold down the button, futz with a D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since the other tank was moving as well and probably shooting at you in tact, quite a pain. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally get these calls from headquarters and to do that your name is (get this) snake. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also select special ammo on the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they use some more powerful ammo here to take out the boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enemies will drop icons that refill your Special Weapons or you're entering. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Quite a bit was changed for the home version (as have been the case with most SNK games). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There now various branching paths added, it's made quite a bit more you know console like. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, I wish I had like "Iron Tank" better. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Playing after "Jackal" makes it seem like the lamer earlier version of "Jackal" (which I guess it is). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game starts getting [pretty] hairy in the second level - just throws way too many tanks at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe if the turret was easier to aim with This be a more fun game to play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But sadly I'm gonna have to call this another Miss from SNK. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sangokushi: Nakahara No Hasha 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another one here from Namco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This time it's an original title developed by Tose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's "Sangokushi..." the subtitle being "Nakahara No Hasha" or "Chugen No Hasha" (depending on how you choose to read the characters). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is unrelated to the more well-known 'Sangokushi' series from Koei. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'So, wait a second; what exactly is all this Sangokushi stuff?', ya ask. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, 'Sangokushi' means 'Three Kingdoms' and refers to a period of time between the Han and Jin dynasties, when China was divided into three separate states. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much of the story He's involved with struggles tween Leo Bay (pictured here), Soon Schwann, and Salsoul (This guy here) who acts as, sort of, the villain of the story. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though countless minor figures and characters populate The Three Kingdoms stories. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some clarifications: 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are two Three Kingdom books. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game named self after the "Record of The Three Kingdoms" (a rather dry historical document written in a third century). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much more frequently read is the so-called "Romance of The Three Kingdoms" = a massive historical novel written some 1100 years later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Three Kingdoms inspired countless books, Chinese operas, movies, T.V. shows, and cartoons in China. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even today, big budget Three Kingdom movies are [pretty] common over there, such as John Woo's recent "Red Cliff". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, Three Kingdoms have always been quite popular in Japan as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So as the game opens, we have a lot of character choosing operations to go through. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And make a series of decisions and end up with a particular historical figure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I received you on Chow, I believe, who actually died, maybe 20 years before The Three Kingdoms period, though, in fact, the majority of maps The Three Kingdoms takes place during the end of the Han Dynasty (really before the three Kings turret actually started). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, I'll try to keep this somewhat brief because this is another Strategy Game and one dependent on being very good at reading Japanese. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I doubt most folks out there will decide to play it after watching this video. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But just, sort of, give you an idea of what's going on here There are four categories from which to choose actions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Under the palace option, you can get info on neighboring cities, as well as check your own stats, move your generals around, check the network of roads (as we see here), raise taxes, that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you have the warehouse icon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That will let you spend some money and move around supplies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also the soldier icon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That controls military matters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can send out patrols, deploy troops, that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the last time icon looks, sort of, like a city. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here you can buy weapons, heal in the hospital to recover health, and study in order to raise your intelligence. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, unlike "Nobunaga's Ambition", you can make multiple moves per turn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So well there you have it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's the first "Romance of The Three Kingdoms" game for a console. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually Koei would come out with a FamiCom version of its own 'Three Kingdoms' games, and then spin it off into things like "Dynasty Warriors" and that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's actually quite a few Japanese do games based around The Three Kingdoms so I'm sure we'll be seeing these guys again at some point. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Radical Bomber!! Jirai Kun 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Jaleco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Radical Bomber!! Jirai Kun" from Jaleco - another a completely baffling little game on the F.D.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Has a cool name however. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it wasn't just the U.S. that was into the word 'radical' back in the '80s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Jirai', by the way, means 'landmine', apparently. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, also, let's not forget about "Radical Dreamers". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I guess the Japanese, sort of, radical stuff as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we have a lengthy little intro, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the game gives you various play options. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you set everything up, you'll see this is like a turn-based Strategy Game of a sort, almost like a Board Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya play as the Pink Guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the other team (four guys in blue) are controlled by the CPU. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there are three menu options, move map, view, the map, and paku Don allows you to blow up the connection between two platforms. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you move, then the other teams move. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, I'm not really sure what the object of "...Jirai Kun" is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really not obvious from playing it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You lose by getting trapped by the other four guys, but how do you win? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are platforms mark, P or w with numbers on them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What do they do? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing really obvious happens When they land on them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's even like a hidden option of having the game play itself (you know, what they call the Watch Mode). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I tried this but it couldn't discern a clear strategy from the computer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, without knowing the rules of the game, I'd say this is gonna be [pretty] difficult to play. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hiryu no Ken II: Dragon no Tsubasa 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Culture Brain 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Culture Brain 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last game we had from Culture Brain was the very ambitious and way ahead of its time "the magic of shirzad". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This time it's "Hiryu no Ken II..." the sequel to "Hiryu no Ken" or "Flying Dragon Secret Scroll". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow, there's so many options on the main menu! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's do normal mode first. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the game starts with a backstory (something about like an evil King of darkness, unleashing his minions or something like that). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who cares!? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But really put a little paint box for the art of their. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, unlike the first game This one was never-released in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In case you don't remember "Flying Dragons Secret Scroll", it was like this oddball Beat-'em-Up in which you mixed in one-on-one fighting segments with like these Beat-'em-Up segments. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Definitely not [pretty] game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, and here's the sequel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow! Definitely much bigger sprites! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also the punch and kick controls are probably a little easier to use. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But unfortunately, when we start the game, well, this is basically "Hokuto no Ken" (Great.) with a splash of more modern games, like the console "Rygar". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally [only] dirty little caves and talk to us these bird guys. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you also need to fight them from time to time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you also find like items hidden in structural blocks, you see one, right here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great now here comes the rolling boulders, points of pleasure, see those video games? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Break that block off the kick. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Okay, so what about those other game options?' you might ask. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well there's one list there called the R.P.G. option. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is, sort of, weird; there's like an extra intro and there's it becomes like a turn-based Fighting Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You select the option to like fight in the menu or defend and then you try to hit the opponent in the right place. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This actually is the same fighting setup as the first game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A target will appear briefly indicating where you should hit to major damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When a target appears on you need to block. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this normal game starts. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The versus mode is just what it sounds like. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like a one-on-one tournament fighting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What makes "her you know kin to" so bad or the awkward controls, especially jumping. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You jump by pressing Up in these sorts of games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Using the D path to jump in columns get [pretty] unpleasant, especially when you have to have like jumping from platform to platform. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "here you know kin" seems [pretty] lame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I never got past the first level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think it seems to go like a loop. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess he was like perform some action to get out of it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the game gets better later, but when I played it so janky jumping wave after a wave of identical mindless enemies, someone throwing sticks and rocks you from off screen (like Hudson into the "Kung-Fu" for the TurboGrafx). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not a very impressive effort Yet more sequels continue to be made. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Real Baseball '88 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Pax Softnica 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Vap 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A name that strikes terror at all FamiCom gamers: VAP (the guys behind that horrible horrible "...Super Monkey Daibōken" game). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this time they have Pax Softnica developing in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So in theory, it might be alright! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, after all, Pax Softnica developed Sports Games for Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like they could help Ice Hockey so they know Sports Games, I would assume. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, let me point out that "Super Real Baseball..." uses real life team names and logos. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Tokyo Dome is depicted and they welcome player Warren Cromartie is shown on the box art (commodity being one of the more high profile us players to come to Japan to play). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's all kinds of licensing going on producing this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is definitely not a "Family Stadium" clone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But a realistic Baseball Game, sort of, like Jaleco's "Bases Loaded". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, unlike "Best Play Pro Yakyuu", This is action based, rather than concerned with league management. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the controls are a bit tricky at first. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to hit the A button to send your batter to the plate and then hit a again to raise your bat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you can, sort of, aim the bat using the D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you hit a at third time to swing! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For some reason. I got a lot of fouls and weird hits. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, this GPU is very good at catching everything hit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now outbuilding (what I'm doing here) is a completely different matter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The balls move very fast. And so to your outfielders (so fast, they're hard to control, they, sort of, zoom around a lot). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in a virtually game killing issue, it's really hard to pick up the damn ball and throw it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Gave me a standing what appears to be right on top of it pressing the button, but nothing happens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to keep repositioning yourself over and over again to find the invisible spot that allows you to pick up the ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I always feel that any activity should be easier to perform in a video game than in real life. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When picking a ball up off the ground is this difficult, you know something seriously wrong with the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is not the worst Baseball Game we've ever seen. But it certainly isn't easy to play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that constant shrieking whistle noise in the background... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why do so many Japanese do games have that? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's completely headache-inducing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, yeah, this is another Baseball flop. 🍇🍌
