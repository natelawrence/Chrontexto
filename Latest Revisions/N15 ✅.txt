👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 15 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Thank you for tuning into "Chrontendo Episode 15". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We're gonna start this episode off, right where we left off. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Chrontendo Episode 14" ended with "Zelda II: The Adventures of Link". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We're gonna start with another sequel to a big huge Japanese hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yep! It's "Dragon Quest II": a game that sold {a} few [million] copies in Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Heck! This is practically a special R.P.G. episode because we now see Konami enter the R.P.G. ring with their *own* game, "Esper Dream". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And], of course, there's the usual selection of weird, miscellaneous, [and] bizarre Japanese *titles*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And], *by the way*, if you *like* 'Chrontendo', make sure you check out our *companion* series, 'Chronsega', the first episode of which was just released. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Chronsega' will be covering the Sega Master System *in chronological* order. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, I apologize in advance for the *excessive* length of the "Dragon Quest *II*" coverage, but I guess I had a lot to say about that game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dragon Quest II 🇯🇵 // Dragon Warrior II 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 January 26 🇯🇵 // 1990 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Chunsoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Enix 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🦜🍊🍓 We kick off this episode with a huge release and what is probably the biggest, longest, and most ambitious release for the FamiCom yet: Enix's "Dragon Quest II." 🍇

✅🦜🍊🍓 The first 'Dragon Quest' game, released in May 1986, was a big hit in Japan, and Enix and developer Chunsoft somehow managed to get this sequel out nine months later. 🍇🍌


✅🦜🍊🍓 The game was eventually released in the U.S. in 1990 as "Dragon Warrior *II*", with a snazzy new title screen, title scroll explaining the plot, and a new expository [introductory] sequence. 🍇

✅🦜🍊🍓 The original Japanese version began with a wounded soldier entering the King's *chamber* room. 🍇🍌


✅🦜🍊🍓 Still, the story of "Dragon Quest II" is almost told entirely in-game, rather than in-manual, as was the case of most video games at this point — for example, the '...Zelda' games. 🍇

✅🦜🍊🍓 In this case, you [can] never have actually *read* the manual and still [pretty] much fully understand the story. 🍇

✅🦜🍊🍓 This is something that's true of most games *nowadays*, but back in the 8-bit days, usually [only] R.P.G.s tried [to] tell the story in the game itself. 🍇🍌


✅🦜🍊🍓 *Something* to consider is that *back* in 1987, video game sequels for *console* games were *not really* that *common*. 🍇

✅🦜🍊🍓 "Zelda II...", for example, which we saw *last* episode, and [was released only] about a week prior to *this* game, made the mistake of altering the basic *formula* of "...Legend of Zelda", [removing] a lot of the things [that] made "...Zelda" so *memorable*, and not really replacing them with anything as compel... -- compelling. 🍇🍌


✅🦜🍊🍓 And this right here is the point where the *original* Japanese game begins. 🍇🍌


✅🦜🍊🍓 Now, "Dragon Quest *II*", on the other hand, is a *perfect* example of how [to] do a sequel right: expand on the original game [and] add new [interesting] gameplay *elements*. 🍇

✅🦜🍊🍓 Uh... They [added] more *content* [to] the game and [fixed] some [of] the flaws that hindered the original. 🍇

✅🦜🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest II" is very *similar* [to] "Dragon Quest", but bigger [and] better [in] every way. 🍇🍌


✅🦜🍊🍓 As before, you begin in your home castle, with the most basic equipment and a [li'l bit] of cash. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Each town is filled with N.P.C.s, shops, and an inn - not to mention those tantalizing locked doors [and] treasure chests. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You won't [be able to] open them until much later in the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, you now have a specific goal; rather than just defeating the bad guy, find your cousins, the Prince of Cannock and the Princess of Moonbrooke. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Just like in "Dragon Quest *(I)*", you walk around on the overworld and face random battles for Experience [and] Gold. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here is the game's ubiquitous Slimes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They're always [the] first enemies you encounter [in pretty] much every 'Dragon Quest' game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing - "Dragon Quest II" *has* removed [the] little backgrounds [that] appear *behind* enemies and replaced them with these plain black screens ({I'm} not really sure why that is). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, first [of] all, [you're] looking for the Prince of Cannock. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In his *castle*, you'll find he's not *there*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, rather amusingly, his *sister* tells ya he travels slowly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This turns out [to] be completely false as you'll end up chasing him all over the continent. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Whenever you go where ya hear [he's] *headed*, it turns out *he's* already left. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another nice little feature of "Dragon Quest II" - you [can] save in castles *other* than the beginning castle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, you can save in *almost* any castle or town. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this all brings us up to the major innovation of "Dragon Quest II" - you [control] a party of *three* characters rather than just *one* as in the *first* "Dragon Quest", (and [pretty] much every other Japanese R.P.G. [up to] this *point*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I finally caught [up to] the prince here in an inn. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest {II}"'s main inspiration, "Ultima III...", standardized a party of *four* characters as would many future Japanese R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, unfortunately, the prince comes *equipped* with very low abilities and very bad armor [and] weapons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, of] course, you have to buy everything *for* him. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *princess* is a little tricker {to} find; she's been transformed [into] this dog here which follows you around when you talk to it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's the clue. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [ya need to] find a certain magical item [to] break the spell. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once a new party member has joined [your] *team*, you'll be *horrified* [to] learn they actually start at Level 1, and [are pretty] much completely useless [at] first. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Later on, Japanese R.P.G.s would adopt a convention that new characters are [already] kind of Leveled Up when ya *meet* them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes they're actually more powerful [than the] *other* [members of your] party. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, in this game, uh, the characters [are pretty] worthless, and you'll be com... -- desperately tryin' [to] prevent them from being killed in every single *battle*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [However], *once* these guys have gained a few levels, they *do* get [pretty] useful as they [can] cast magic, unlike your main character (in [particular] healing spells as well as status [and] attack spells). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Whereas] in "Dragon Quest (I)" you fought enemies one-on-one, in *this* game, you face [an] entire *row* of enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, this adds [an] entirely new element [to] the battle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Fighting enemies in "Dragon Quest *(I)*" mostly consisted of trading *blows* until one of you ran [out] of H.P.. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest II" uses [what would] become the standard Japanese R.P.G. mode of battle - using [your] *stronger* characters to attack the *enemy* while the *weaker* characters focus on support [and] magic. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In "Dragon Quest II", you [can] choose which *group* of enemies to attack, but *[not]* a [specific] member of [that] group. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, if [attacked] by a group of *strong* monsters, you *[can't]* focus on taking 'em out one [at] a time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] characters seem to attack enemies [at] *random*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Conversely*, you [can't] have [Esgar and] Gwen gang [up] on *one* enemy [while your] *main* character kills off the rest by *[himself]*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This would, of course, become a standard tactic when playing, uh, Japanese R.P.G.s *later*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 By this stage, Gwen has learned a stronger offensive spell, *' Infernos'*, which [can *attack*] every enemy in the group rather [than] just *one*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Later spells* will damage all enemies on the *screen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This [particular] sequence [of] *spells*, uh, (early spells targeting [only] one individual while later more *[powerful]* spells target a *group*) would become standard policy in Japanese R.P.G.s, to this very day. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], of course, enemies in "Dragon Quest *II*" use a variety of horrible status spells. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Eventually*, you'll seem [to] come [to, sort of], a dead end (g... -- nothing left to *explore*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then suddenly you acquire a *ship*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Suddenly, the entire *world* opens *up* [to] you *[and]* the world of "Dragon Quest II" is much larger [than that] of the previous game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, the entire *world* of "Dragon Quest *(I)*" is *part* [of] this game as one of several continents. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We [just] landed on it, right *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We [can] even visit the *castle* from the first game as well as the Dragonlord's Castle. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] see [it] right *there* in the little *swamp*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The guy who refills [your] magic [for] *free* is even still around. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [However], most [of] the towns seemed to have disappeared. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And "Dragon Quest II" is a *literal sequel* to "Dragon Quest (I)". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It takes place apparently hundreds of years [later, and you're some sort of] *descendant* of the guy from the *first* game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Aside from improved battle [and] a bigger *world*, there [are quite] a few other things that have changed in "Dragon Quest II". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The N.P.C.s and *side quests* are more *[interesting]*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This King, [for] example, wants ya [to fight] a monster in his *arena*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *interface* is less clunky (no more using a menu to go upstairs, for example), and you no longer have [to] use a *torch* [to] see inside a *dungeon*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *But*, the dungeons [and] *towers* in this game *are much trickier* to find your way *around* [in]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They're full of multiple paths, dead ends, uh, trapdoors [that] take you down to *lower* le... -- floors, all kinds of strange areas [that] you [have to], sort of, find a, uh, [particular] exit [to get out] of; otherwise, you'll keep, [sort of], roaming around {and} [around] in circles. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, there's actually a much [greater] variety of enemies, uh, quite a few of which are very colorful. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Altogether, I think there [are] around 75 or so, as compared [to] the 35 or 40 in [the] *first game* as well as more items [and] spells (around 22 spells compared [to] "Dragon Quest"'s 9). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, there is less time spent [walking around] in one place tryin' to gain levels. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *game* is also more nonlinear [and] puzzle-like. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... At least what you [are] doing is not always spelled [out for] you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, I'm looking for the Gold Key (something you need to get into all those red doors). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it's *not* [that] easy [to] *find*; this dog has actually *buried* it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 What you're mostly doing once you've actually, uh, find the boat [and] sail [out into] the *world* - well, you can explore around all ya [want]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But eventually, [it] turns out that your main goal is [to find] these five *crests*, and, of course, you'll [need] *items* in order [to find] *those* (such as the Gold Key [and] also the *Jailor's* Key). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Dragon Quest *(I)*" keys are *reusable*, [but] they're [pretty] hard [to] find, and they're, sort of, hidden (as I mentioned [earlier]) kind of randomly around the world. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, this town right here, actually - you need the Gold Key [to] get *inside* of it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This [particular] town sells some of the most powerful armor [and] weapons in the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But they're *quite* expensive, as you can see here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [only] have around *$*10,000 at this moment. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, as it turns out, the best armor [and] weapons in this game are generally *found* rather than bought. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This guy *here* [will] tell ya [how to] make the best armor [for] *Gwen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And of course, you've got [to] go all [over] the *world* looking [for] the *ingredients*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then you've gotta find the guy [to] make it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *none* of this is exactly spelled out *clearly* in the game *itself*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once you get the *Jailor's* Key, you're able to open up the little doors [that] look like *prison bars*; {of} course we've [encountered] these in many towns [and] *castles*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the guys inside will give you their li'l clues or hints or [important] items, ...all that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There are, sort of, some mid-bosses; these two Ozwargs - they're, uh, similar to monsters you faced before but much more powerful. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Just like a lot of early games, "Dragon Quest II" uses a lot of, uh, sprites with palette swaps. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, what all this boils down to is that "Dragon Quest II" *is* much more nonlinear than the *first* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In "Dragon Quest (I)", you [pretty] much followed a path around the *continents* looking for items [and] whatnot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] *this game*, once ya get the *ship* it -- there's *really* no, sort of, [set] *order* [in] which you visit the *towns*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The monsters [in] *some* areas are more [difficult] than -- [than] *others*, but, uh, you [can pretty] much sail around anywhere ya *want*, just, sort of, looking [to] random towns [and] castles [for] *clues*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, of course, it'll all, sorta come together. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also returning [in] this game are the famous Metal Slimes, which have m... ah -- much, uh, higher *Experience* [if] you *kill* [them], but, of course, they're very hard [to] *kill*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This also [introduces] the Metal Babble [to] the game which is *tougher* [and] yields around a 1000 Experience Points (very good [for] early to middle [in] the game). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now certainly in "Dragon Quest II," a greater variety of level design [has been introduced]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... It has the now-standard fire world, for example, full of dangerous lava [and] tough enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [are] looking for a *statue* [that] is required to open up the path to Hargon's lair. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now eventually, of course, in these sorts {of} games (as well as Platformers), you know the fire level [and] the ice level would become quite common. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Oddly enough, another game we're seeing {in} [this] episode, "Esper Worlds", has a, uh -- an ice world in it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, while this game is certainly a big improvement over the first one, there *are* some kind of annoying factors. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... *One* [of] them is the general underpowering of *magic*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have *healing* magic, but {it} doesn't really heal that much [and] magic tends to run out [pretty] quickly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Certain enemies (such as the puppets) will do a strange jig which will shave 12 to 30 M.P. points (I've seen as high as *35*), and this [can] quickly drain your M.P.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [can] *often* lead to utter *disaster*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Once in one [of] the *towers*, I [encountered] a group of enemies, including three *puppets*, that *immediately* stole *all* of my remaining *magic*, thus leaving me with [pretty] much no [healing] abilities or even [enough] magic to warp outside the *tower*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There *aren't* really any items [to] *restore* your magic other [than] the rare [and] rather unreliable *[Wizard's]* Rings. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll find Gwen's magic spells are not very [good in] the offensive department - [only], uh, dispensing around 20 [to] 30 points of damage. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As ya get midway [in] the game, encountering enemies that have 50 [to] 90 Hit Points Gwen [just] can't take [out] enemies fast enough [to] do much, uh, good. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [at] this point you're encountering some [of] the more dangerous enemies in the game, including these Blizzards that can cast a spell called, 'Defeat' on your entire party, and -- which will sometimes get lucky and kill one or two party members in one go. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Giants [will] *occasionally* deal around 125 points of damage with one attack, which can kill one character *instantly*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And here, of course, you [can] see how frequently your magic spells [can] miss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The powerful ones like 'Explodet' are -- are good when they hit but sometimes, [only] hitting one or even *none* of the enemies is -- [will] happen [to] you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Getting wiped out is very easy in this *level*, and you will *have* [to] do some major *grinding*, [in order to] make it all the way [to] the end [of] the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, believe [it or] not, there is actually these, uh, villains called "Batboons" which [can] cast a spell called "Sacrifice", which simply kills off your entire party. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And you'll be using healing magic *constantly* on this last level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 At one point, um, after, uh, leaving the last, uh, save point and venturing towards [the] final *castle*, Gwen had used almost two-thirds [of her] magic after *literally* traveling six steps. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 My Blizzards had here killed two party members [and] the odds [are] definitely not *good* so I had [to] *run*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Remember, of course, sometimes you *can't* run, and this will often result in *death* for your party. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Luckily*, you [can] *restore* your party for *free* at this shrine. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, at times, 'Dragon Quest {II}' can be much more creative than earlier R.P.G.s. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, when you reach Hargon's *Castle*, you mysteriously *find* yourself inside your *home castle*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is, sort of, a surprising *moment* [and] you'll need the Charm of Rubiss, which you traded in the five *crests* for, in order [to] clear the illusion. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There is an *inn* which you can *heal* at, which seems nice, but... once the illusion is dispelled, your H.P. [and] M.P. [revert back to what] they were [before] you previously found the real Hargon's Castle. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you're inside the castle itself, you'll need to move up a few flights of stairs (*some* of which are [pretty] difficult [to] *find*) [and] face *three* bosses [before] fighting Hargon [himself]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is, sort of, an early example of a *[boss]* rush, I guess. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... And there's also one *last* boss. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [We'll] be seeing the end [of] the game here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I [don't] know if a spoiler warning should be [required] on a 20-year-old video game... but if you've been putting off playing this game [for the] last two decades, consider [yourself] warned. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] ya do have opportunities [to] heal [before] *battles*, these [last] guys (like Atlas, here) are *[pretty]* tough [and] odds are ya will [get] killed a few times. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, you'll [probably] be killed frequently in "Dragon Quest II" - [and] *not always fairly*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These old-school R.P.G.s generally show no mercy and a [little] bad [luck] is all it takes. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *sleep* spells are one [of] the *worst* offenders. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] it's not *that uncommon* for your entire party to be put to sleep before ya have the chance to even make one move. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Combining sleep casting enemies with monsters [that can] do a [lot of] damage, can spell *doom* [for your] entire party. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya might also wish that Esgar [and] Gwen were a little stronger. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Our *hero* [can] take a [lot of] punishment [but your] other two characters have weaker *defense* and can't equip good armor or weapons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It seems they spend much time simply casting 'Heal' on themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And unlike a lot of later R.P.G.s like the 'Final Fantasy' games, they never [get] any really powerful spells. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So, your] hero [definitely] does most [of] the heavy lifting - fighting wise. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If a character *does* get killed, [only] Esgar [can] *revive* them, [and] they [only] have one Hit Point. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [only] *other* way tee -- is to use a World Tree *Leaf* [and] you [can only] get [that] leaf in one [particular] island. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Inventory space is *limited* [and will] *mostly* be taken up by armor, weapons, keys, quest items, [et] cetera. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So], ya [can't] exactly stock up on *healing* items, [and] there's *no* way to completely restore your party's health or magic. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And a spell that will heal *all* the characters at once *would have* been nice, [as] well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, here we finally come to Hargon, and he is, of course, the, uh -- the *fake* final boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's a *little* tough, but not *that* bad. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Once] you *defeat* him, he'll then give you the *real* final boss - which, of course, is even more [difficult]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The main bad guy is one of those 'physical embodiment of evil' types (another video game cliche). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this guy has a lot of Hit Points and can completely heal himself with the 'Healall' spell (it's actually quite *annoying*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *once* you defeated *him* (unlike most games {of} this era) "Dragon Quest II" doesn't simply *end*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll find yourself in a monsterless world full of happy N.P.C.s. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Returning [to your] home castle will get you crowned King, and *then* the game [will] end. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Dragon Quest II" - it's far from perfect, but certainly, the best J.R.P.G. to have [come out] so far, and surprisingly playable [today]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I suppose it is an [important] marker in the history [of] the genre. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 J.R.P.G.s were now headed down a *completely different path* [than] Western *Computer* R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Around] this time, a new generation of U.S.-made Role Playing Games ('...Bard's Tale', 'Might [and] Magic', [and] so on) were coming out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But these games were much more 'Dungeons & Dragons' orientated - based on a standard Sword and Sorcery Fantasy world, and focusing more on stats [and] heavy blocks of text. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The 'Dragon Quest' games were much more video gamey [and] quirky [and most] Japanese R.P.G.s would follow the template set by this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] 'Dragon Quest' does take place in the mind...al -- medieval world, the villains [and] enemies really aren't, sort of, your standard trolls [and] orcs [and that] sort of thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] there's even a bit of a Science-Fiction element with robots [thrown] in. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm sure a lot of this had to do with Akira Toriyama's designs, and [remember that] he was *extremely* famous in Japan at this time [and] his name may have really helped the popularity of "Dragon Quest II". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 For [whatever] reason, "Dragon Quest II" sold around two [and] a half million copies [in] Japan [and] inspired an even better sequel. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ultraman: Kaijuu Teikoku no Gyakushuu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 January 29 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?]
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Dragon Quest II" throws a [pretty] long shadow over this episode, and we're now gonna [have to] deal with some [of] these less epic releases. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For *example*, the first of three *Bandai* g... -- titles this episode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Bandai is definitely nothing if not prolific. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Ultraman: Kaijū Teikoku no Gyakushū" is (I think) the first 'Ultraman' game and certainly the first [for] the *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [don't] know who *developed* this game but [it] was perhaps some other contract developer besides Tose. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But don't worry, Tose fans; we will actually see a Tose title {a} little [bit] later this episode. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I assume most -- everyone out there is familiar with 'Ultraman'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was the popular '60s Japanese television show, which falls into what we call the Kaiju genre. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S. {we} might call this the, Giant *Monster* genre. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There have been countless sequels [and] spin-offs [to] the original 'Ultraman' series (like, such as, 'Ultraman 80', 'Ultraman Leo', 'Ultra Q' and so on). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But I don't think there was an 'Ultraman' T.V. show being produced when this game came out! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this release is rather uncharacteristic of the normally very tie-in orientated Bandai. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As I'm *sure* you've already noticed, the "Ultraman..." game is basically a run, jump, and shoot scrolling Platformer - really nothing spectacular on *display* here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But it is a [hell of a lot] better [than that] "Transformers: Convoy no Nazo" game, so we should be grateful for *that*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You *[start] off* each level as what is presumably Shin Hayata (Ultraman's human alter ego). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 After collecting in those [little] glowing *Power* Spheres [to] fill the *meter* in the upper *right*, you can transform [into] Ultraman. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is really the [only] interesting feature of this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is somewhat sloppily produced. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll notice a few things here, for example. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 (Oops... not quite landing on a mountain there.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, [for] some reason, it's extremely difficult [to] actually pick up *that* particular Power Sphere, as it's, sort of, embedded in the mountainside. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, I'll figure [it] out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you've [obtained] that sphere, as I mentioned, you [can] of -- tr... -- transform into Ultraman and do battle with the end-of-level boss. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As Ultraman, [you] lose your layer firing *capabilities*, but you [can], sort of, do hand [to] hand combat. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this isn't exactly a Fighting Game, so you [pretty] much just hit [him] over [and] over again with your arm chop. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, sometimes hits register when the boss' head is open [and] unprotected, and other times they don't. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *great* now we're on to Level *2*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *scale* of this [game] is *[actually] kinda weird*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You're [supposed to] be a normal human size *person* in *this form*, but you're *actually enormous* [in relationship to] those buildings. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *"Ultraman..."* is [not] really a game for the *ages*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's just ...no... -- another quickie title from -- from *Bandai*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's, uh, I suppose *playable*, but you [probably won't] think *too* highly of it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Eggerland 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 January 29 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL Laboratory 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 From our good buddies HAL Laboratories, it's "Eggerland". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And "Eggerland" is one of two HAL games this episode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And clearly, this is the game that was closest to HAL's heart. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 HAL's typical attention [to] detail [and] dedication [to] pol... -- quality are immediately apparent from this rather, uh, catchy musical theme, uh, (not [to] mention the rather long [expository] opening *sequence*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is actually [pretty] darn *impressive*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... These kind of openings were [pretty *unusual* in] console games, at this time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Just think back [to] "Zelda II..." from lapse -- last episode, just a [pretty] simple [little] title screen and, uh, text scroll.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here basically, we see the, uh, whole [plot of] the game kind of detailed out in *animation*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And that part right there where [he] flies away to his castle is [pretty] cool as *well*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 HAL's "Gall Force..." also had a very long intro, but, of course, the game itself was completely *terrible*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now with "Eggerland" HAL is in [pretty] comfortable territory since this is actually the third 'Eggerland' release. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [had] been two *earlier* games released for M.S.X. computers in *1985* and *1986*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *"Eggerland"* [for] the F.D.S. is, uh, somewhat confusingly, a *modified* port of "Eggerland 2" for the M.S.X. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Japanese gamers *must* [have had] a [pretty] strong appetite for "Sokoban"-type *Puzzle* Games [in] the 1980s since a total of *five* games for the F.D.S. or FamiCom would be released *in* Japan (not to mention one U.S.-[only] title, "The Adventures of Lolo"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Eggerland" is, sort of, the, uh, "*Mega* Man" of *Puzzle* Games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *in* "Eggerland", you control the rather rotund Prince Lolo, who is, uh, (typically) rescuing his girlfriend. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is done by navigating through a series of [interconnected] rooms. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Since the rooms have locked doors, you'll need to obtain *keys* found in the locked *chests*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *chests* [can] be opened by collecting all the *hearts* in each *room*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As per "Sokoban" rules, you [can] *push* boxes but [are] unable [to] *pull* them [for] some never-explained reason. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Lolo, as we [saw] a second ago, also has the ability [to] fire a very limited number of magic *shots* which will temporarily transform an enemy into a harmless egg. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, you have [to] be *very careful* in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Otherwise you -- a simple [little] mistake can, uh, make a [level unsolvable]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you actually, uh, saw there just a second ago, I pushed one box just a little too far and, uh, got myself stuck. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, exiting [and] reentering a room *[will] reset* the boxes, um, so you [can] usually find your way out of the mess. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, it doesn't work if you're... on the first room like I was there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And this is] basically how the game *goes* for 122 *rooms*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, [of] course, you occasionally [have to] be clever (like, for example, using the eggs to cross [the] little *rivers*, there). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There really isn't too much timing required, though occasionally ya do have [to] be quick. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "[It's] more of [somehow I'm] just tryin' [to] figure out how exactly to push those darn boxes around. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] sometimes when you, uh, grab the last heart enemies will come alive [and] *kill* you (like just happened to me there). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing about this game is there are often multiple doors in each room. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, you'd have to, uh -- Wh... -- When you open the doors, you don't always know what the best [door] to -- [to] walk out through is. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, again, uh, a second ago, I mentioned enemies coming [to] life; this is another level [where I had to] be careful. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Those guys [will start] *breathing fire* as soon as you grab the last box, so you want to, uh, push the blocks around [to] actually block that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Only] that guy in the, uh, top middle section there would kill you... if you tried to walk past him while he was breathing fire. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *right now* I've entered a room that I actually *could* have entered *earlier* from the lower *left*-hand door, but the *room* is [pretty] much *unsolvable* from that direction. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you enter from the *top* like I did here a *second* ago, [you'll be] able to push the blocks around [and] block the enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, this game isn't so much about timing, as [it] is [about, sort] of, carefully planning out which way you're going [to] go. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Really, there's a [lot] of trial [and] error in "Eggerland". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm gonna say that overall, "Eggerland" is [probably] a [bit] more complex [and] challenging than your typical "Sokoban"-style game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Probably] one of the bether -- better, uh, Puzzle Games of this type [that have] been released on FamiCom *so* far. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [for] fans of this [particular] *style* of games, uh, (the old-school Puzzle Games that didn't involve, uh, trying to match up colored objects that were falling down), uh, definitely, uh, this game is worth your *while*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Black Bass 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 February 06 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Another
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hot-B 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well "...Black Bass" certainly takes the cake for the most inexplicable cover [and] *title* screen (not [to] mention one of the most hideous musical themes for the *FamiCom*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You might assume this is the original Japanese version of the U.S. game, also called, uh, "...Black Bass" (or rather "...Black Bass USA"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But once the game itself starts, you will see that '*No*; this is a completely different game.'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sort of, like 'Fist of the *North* Star', it was actually the *sequel* [to] this game, "...Black Bass *II*", that was released in in the U.S. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The premise is similar to the later, more familiar game; choose a lure, pick a spot out on the lake, and then cast [your] line. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once your line is cast, [you] use your *D-Pad* [to] wiggle the lure, [and] then *carefully* reel the fish *in*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Reeling too *quickly* [will] *break* the line. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *general layout* [of] the main screen reminds me a lot of Nintendo's old "Golf" game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Coincidently, Nintendo will be releasing a new Golf Game a [little] later in February 2 -- 8 -- 1987. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "...Black Bass" is not the most *pleasant*-looking game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 From that horrible checkerboard border on the main screen to the physically impossible-looking arc the fishing line moves in, when you *cast*, everything in this game shows a general lack of *taste*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's not surprising the *publisher* [of] this game has one of the [worst] names in video game history, Hot-B. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As [I] recall, the name actually means something perfectly logical. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 B doesn't stand for bass, and Hot-B is, uh, still a very poorly considered name. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They eventually changed [the] name [to] Starfish. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is their first game [for] the FamiCom [and], as far as I know, they're still around making games.🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here we are, trying [to] reel in the fish. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Note your line is not visible [and] it's actually [pretty] easy [to] reel too quickly [and] have the line *break*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But I [can't] help but *wonder*, 'What exactly is your character supposed to be *wearing*?'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, I wouldn't consider "...Black Bass" [to] be a *good* game, but it *did* set the stage for the entire Fishing [and Hunting] Games sub-genre (much more so than "Duck Hunt"), especially [in] the way that [it] tries to somewhat accurately recreate the act of fishing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 While, ya know, serious gamers [and] critics usually don't have much *use* [for] these games, Fishing [and] Hunting Games still exist as a *reasonably* successful sub-genre of Sports Games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nazoler Land 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 February 02 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sunsoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our third FamiCom Disk System game, this episode is from the ever baffling Sunsoft. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Nazoler Land..." is what we might call a magazine release. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We'll discuss what that means in just a moment. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Note the dual copyright with Sekaibunka-sha - a Japanese publishing house. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Incidentally, the art [and] *character* design are by an established Japanese cartoonist named [Nankin]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, I don't think he's really known [in] the West. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You don't really see magazine releases [for] video game consoles *anymore*, but they were somewhat common at one *point* - usually for *computer* systems. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The cartridges usually had an *issued number* on them [and] came [out] on a semi-regular basis. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, the next 'Nazoler Land' game came [out in] *June*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And they generally contain several *small* games *plus* some additional non-game material. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The closest [we've] seen to this, so far, [for] the FamiCom was those *educational* games from Tokyo Shoseki that were released back in *1986*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the name "Nazoler Land" indicates the games [will] be *Puzzle*-orientated. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this one [right] here is [probably] the most interesting - a sort of, clever little *Maze Game* with revolving doors. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can actually] push [your] way *through* a door as long [as the door is] able [to] move. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... [For] example, an instance where the, uh -- one of the limbs, sort of, blocks -- is blocked by a... brick wall, you [won't be able to] open the door. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Note the character's, uh, sort of, similarity to "Pac-Man", here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this game is [probably] not really enormously, uh, *original* and *not too much* [effort] was [put] into [it], but I guess it's decent compared [to] some of the other stuff. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I've} no idea how many levels are actually in this thing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *next* one is actually, sort of, a *code* word game; [you] try [to] guess the [correct] *sequence* of *icons*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this case, the icons are all astrological signs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Entering in a *sequence* [will] tell ya [how] many icons are *correct* (that's the number of *empty* stars) [and] how many are correct [and] in the [right] *position* (the number of *solid* stars). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Through *trial* and *error* you [can] eventually [find] the [correct] sequence. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, one is in the right spot in the *first* line there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One [of] the icons is correct [but in] the *incorrect* spot on the *second line*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here I'm getting closer [and] closer; {I} [have] three correct icons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, just] through guessing, [I'll] eventually [find] what the fourth one is. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, this is *[not]* really *that* exciting of a *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *actually*, nothing on this, uh, cartridge is really [that] great. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... The presentation is really not that *impressive*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... But I guess at least games like "Nazoler Land..." [and] "...Black *Bass*" show [that] game makers were *trying* to {be} creative [and] experimenting with different types of releases. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, also on here, [there's], like, this jigsaw puzzle, there's a very *simple* first-person *dungeon* type game, [and] then a first-person *Maze* Game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess the point of all this was [just for] publishers [to] try [to] determine *what exactly* the Japanese public would *buy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Remember], of course, the FamiCom was very *popular*, but *still*... ya know, there wasn't really *much*, um, of a video game *market* [before] the *release* (some [for] computers but, uh, they were still tryin' [to] figure things *out*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, on the *cheaper* FamiCom [Disk] System *releases*, they [can] actually, uh, do some weird *stuff* like this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] we'll see a *lot* [of] this on [the] F.D.S. - just, sort of, off-the-wall [but not] entirely successful *releases*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shin Jinrui: The New Type 🇯🇵 // Adventures of Dino Riki 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 February 10 🇯🇵 // 1989 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Rix Soft 🇯🇵 // Hudson 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, Hudson Soft, what have you done? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is "Shin Jinrui", sometimes called "Shin Jinrui: The New Type". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This title was [developed] by Hudson [and] curiously [published] by *Rix Soft*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 'Who is *Rix Soft*?', ya might ask. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [it] *turns* out they're a company called Ricoh Elemex, a Japanese [manufacturer] of fine measuring equipment, watches, and *photo* copiers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And they're actually still around. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I don't think I've ever seen [another] game *from* them, so I guess their little excursion [into the] world of video game publishing was [pretty] short-lived. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, how exactly did Hudson get involved [in] this? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I've} no idea but [it] turns out Hudson hardly [wasted a] top shelf *game* with Rix Soft. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, "Shin Jinrui..." reminds me of nothing other than Square's god-awful "King's Knight". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [don't] know *why* but [ground]-based Shoot-'em-Ups never seem [to] work. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] character seems much more *mobile* if it's a spaceship or [an] airplane [or] something [that can] *fly*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, granted, "Shin Jinrui..." is not nearly [as] irritating [as] "King's *Knight*", but it's certainly not very much fun either. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, of course, I guess the little Boomerang weapon is kind [of] cool. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There are the typical, uh, power-ups, (ya know) [little] fists, speed-ups, {and} that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's a part [that] *I* hate: jumping over bodies of *water* - instant death [if] you fall in and it's really *easy* to fall in. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess [I'll] try another time here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], of course, [you] lose all [your] power-ups, should you happen [to] *die*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], I guess there are [actually] a couple [interesting] things about this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... The *character* and the stone axe weapons seem taken *almost* [right] out of Hudson's "Adventure Island". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess they [didn't] wanna bother coming up with any actual new *ideas* for this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the *name, "Shin Jinrui"* (literally 'The New Breed'), uh... [it's] a term used [to] describe affluent post-war Japanese *youth*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe [it] also has some [sort] of meaning connected [to] Neolithic mankind? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, there's *also* that hunk of *meat* power-up that sort of resembled something [that was] later found in the *' Bonk'* games by Hudson Soft. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hudson *seems* [to] have, sort of, a thing for *cavemen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., this was released by Hudson themselves as "The Adventures of Dino *Riki*" where [it pretty] much failed [to] make any, [sort of], lasting impression. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hiryu no Ken 🇯🇵 // Flying Dragon: The Secret Scroll 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 February 14 🇯🇵 // 1989 August [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Culture Brain
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Culture Brain 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 What is "Hiryu no Ken"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [naturally] the question is *answered* in the game's [introduction]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, began Culture Brain's, "Hiryu no Ken", known [in] the U.S. [as], "Flying Dragon: The Secret [Scroll]", - entirely appropriate name, since the game has you hunting down some [important] magical scrolls [or] something like [that]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Hiryu no Ken" is Culture Brain's *second* FamiCom *release* after, "*Super* Chinese", back in mid-1986. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it seems they have a thing for "Kung-*Fu*" themed games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Just like, "*Super* Chinese", "Hiryu no Ken", is based on {an} early Arcade Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Another] thing [the] two games have in *common* is that they're *both* a little *clunky*, ugly, [and] just generally unappealing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] Culture Brain wasn't producing quickie *knock*-off games, uh, they *were* making games that were just, uh -- didn't seem quite right. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} [not that] this game isn't without its *merits*, but [it] is a [little] *weird*, [considering that] the [first] boss is a, uh, little girl with *purple hair* who's approximately the same size [as] *you*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If nothing else, this game has a *lot* [of] things [that *don't*] exactly make a whole lot [of] sense. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The original Arcade game, "Shanghai Kid" from *1986*, was completely *different*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was an early *Fighting* Game with a rather unique *system*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Red *targets* would appear, indicating your enemy's *weak* spot *or* (when the enemy's gonna strike *you*) *your* weak spot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You would then try to s... -- ts... uh -- *strike* the weak spot or defend, depending on [the situation]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the *FamiCom* game is actually, sort of, a, uh, Platformer/*Beat*-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Culture Brain completely *rethought* the game, adding a *storyline* [about] an evil "Kung-*Fu*" clan you must defeat *and* sticking in these rather lame Platforming *sequences* in between *fights*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And the] Platforming sections are definitely the *weak* spots. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You fight a never-ending [parade] of, uh, brainless punk rocker dudes, with these weird *boss* fights sprinkled in. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Nothing here much makes sense; the background starts [flashing] during the boss fights ([for] no reason), the music changes constantly (and sometimes just stops *completely*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *boss* fights [are] completely bizarre; we already saw the little *girl* [and] there's a guy [who] looks kinda like an [overgrown] *Jawa*, [and] so on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Everything [is], [sort] of, uh, s... -- hastily thrown together in, s... -- [sort] of, a spastic, [sort] of, game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, once ya complete the first level, ya then go through a *rather lengthy tutorial* on the Fighting Game mechanic, [complete] with *[lots]* of exposition here from Master Juan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And doesn't 'Master Juan' seem like, [sort of], a strange *name* for a *Chinese* guy? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This shows exactly how the, uh, attack [and] defend mechanism works. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing* about "Hiryu no Ken": there is a [lot] of [text] breaking up the action sequences. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Master *Juan* is a *really* talkative *guy*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game has, uh, *way* more explanatory *dialogue* than *any other* FamiCom game I can *think* of. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it was, sort of, like the "Metal Gear *Solid*" of its time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Huh... Eventually, you [will] make [your] way [to] the fighting competition. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... [Of] course, there's [another] Platforming event -- level in-between this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... [And] the enemies [and] bosses on every level are [pretty] much exactly the same. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 During the *fighting* sequence, the game essentially becomes "Shanghai *Kid*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [battle] a series [of] enemies [and must defeat] each one (the last enemy, uh, [in] each round being the toughest). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the actual, uh, "Hiryu no Ken" move is, uh, where ya, sort of, swirl [around and] do, like, a spinning kick (um, like I just did right there) - [reasonably] tricky to get [it] to connect, but it's [pretty] powerful. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, from here on, the pattern [repeats]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Hiryu no Ken" is a [pretty] unique *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [aren't] many Platformer/One-on-One Fighting hybrid games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the Platforming, uh, sections, I [suppose] do, sort of, uh, break up the *monotony* of the *Fighting* Game sections. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, um, like a lot of kitchen sink-type games, it *lacks consistency* and isn't really very satisfying [to] play. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Esper Dream 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 February 20 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, let's fire up ye olde F.D.S. (which is now one year old) [for] a new *Konami* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] this is something *different* from Konami. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's "Esper Dream" an R.P.G.! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] in *some* ways "Esper Dream" is the first 100% Japanese R.P.G. [to] be released after the '*Dragon* Quest' games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Valkyrie..." was almost more [or] less a "...*Zelda*" clone and, uh, "Deep *Dungeon*" was a completely old-[fashioned] U.S.-style *Dungeon* Crawler. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Whereas "*Esper Dream*" is *more* [of] a traditional Japanese-style Action *R.P.G.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *check out* this very nice *intro*, which actually kicks off the story's *narrative*, um, ([still] relatively *uncommon* for an [introduction to] do this, back then). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Like *pretty* much all Japanese R.P.G.s at this *time*, in "*Esper* Dream" you control a single protagonist (uh, "Dragon Quest II" had [*just* introduced] multiple *characters* into Japanese R.P.G.s). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like, "Dragon Quest", "Esper Dream", starts you off in a village [and] -- with some guy who [*explains* your] *quest*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A [lot of] Adventure Games (like "...Zelda", for example) just, sort of, [started] you off [in the middle] of nowhere, whereas *this game*, sort of, eases you [into] the plot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, we have the usual F.D.S. side switching [and] wait times, here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *[plot]* apparently involves some [sort] of kidnapped girl [that ya] have [to] *rescue*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, that's [pretty] standard [for] the time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you generally [begin] the game by walking around [a] village, talking [to] various N.P.C.s, who give you some [sort] of idea of what you're *actually* supposed [to] be *doing* in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And of course, this guy gives you the very basic equipment. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], as you can see here, the village actually looks very *nice*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You actually have, sort of, real *houses* [and], uh, whatnot, rather [than] the rather more abstract castles [and] towns [of] 'Dragon Quest'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "*Esper* Dream" is *actually*, sort of, a weird *inversion* of the typical 'Dragon Quest' world *layout*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Rather* [than] *exiting* the village [and] traveling across the *globe*, the *various worlds* [in] this game are *accessed* through *houses* contained inside the village itself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These are the *gray* houses. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *other* houses [are] just where N.P.C.s live. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes they give [you] helpful *hints*; sometimes they [just] say a bunch [of] *nonsense*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We'll go ahead [and] enter the first dungeon here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And... this setup is some sort of, like, oversized room with giant slippers, block sets, [and] *countertops*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And it's hard [to] say really exactly what's going *on* here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, why [does your] character [suddenly put] on a little weird horned helmet whenever he goes into a *battle* scene? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], unlike your typical "...Zelda" clone, this game has separate battle screens [and] you find yourself locked in a room [with] several enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You then [have to] *kill* them all, in order [to] exit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] enemies will drop Experience Points and cash. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, as] you may [have] seen there, the *hit* detection *can* be a bit weird at times. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] see [the] enemies walking around on the *overworld*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or rather, you [can] see [their *footprints* (which looks, sort] of, like *dog* prints [or] something, despite the [fact that] most [of the enemies] would not leave *prints* like that). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *every world* has a few dungeons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *this* case, the dungeons are entered through the *computer* screens, and they look, sort of, like (I guess) the insides of *computers*, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess you're shrinking down really *small* [or] something. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Each] dungeon has [at] least one object, uh, (maybe a power-up or a quest object of some *sort*, um, such as the ring [that] you'll see). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] also one *dungeon* in each *world* will have a *boss*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "*Esper Dream" does* have some rather pre-'Dragon Quest' elements *to* it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For *example*, just like "Ultima III..." Leveling Up [only] raises your *Hit* Points [and] *Magic* Points. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In order [to] raise your attack and *defense*, ya need [to] purchase the incredibly overpriced *weapons* [and] *armor* found in the *shops*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Enemies [will] *always* give you Experience Points, but they *[don't]* always drop *money* (represented by the little *coin* purses [that] you see lying around). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] usually ya don't get very *much* (maybe 1 [to] 10 Gold for, uh, the early enemies). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here's* the first boss, right here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... It's hard [to] say really what, sort of, themes this game is based on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Most [of] the enemies [are] *bugs* and *fishes*, yet this guy is some kind of, uh, living *plant*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you saw me getting the, uh, *capsule* here - something [ya need to] collect, oh, after each boss (though what [exactly] they're supposed [to] be, I'm not *sure*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, [and] here you can see what I mean by the items being *overpriced*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 At maybe an average of, uh, five pieces of Gold per enemy, it's [gonna take] ya a [while to] buy that leather armor. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, there isn't any, sort of, customization available; [your] character will simply obtain certain magic spells *automatically* after reaching the right *level*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *one* thing that *can* make this game a little *difficult* is the lack of *healing* items. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [only] way you [can] *heal* yourself is to spend a night at the inn, which is a [little expensive at] 100 Gold. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But there aren't any, sort of, health items or magic *refill* items. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *occasionally*, enemies [will] *drop* something that will refill your health or *magic*, but *these* are [pretty] *rare*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, in the second half [of] the game, I think I encountered, like, *maybe* literally *two* or *three* of them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] much the [only] thing [we're] actually buying in the game (other than weapons and armor) are *keys* which [are] used to unlock some [of] the doors [and] dungeons. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, there [are] *five* different worlds in this game, each with about maybe four dungeons each, and *often* with a *village*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, in other words, there's a *main* village; inside that are houses with little worlds *inside* of them - and inside *those* are *more* houses with villages inside of *them*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the worlds are actually *linked* to each other, uh, so that -- this sorta gives you *shortcuts* between different worlds, so you [don't have to go to] the main village [each] time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Esper Dream" has a rather perplexing *theme* to [it]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Rather than a *medieval* setting or *Fantasy* setting like 'Dragon Quest', [this is] sort of, a *storybook* setting, with odd things thrown in, like a bazooka weapon or [robot] enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the *enemies themselves* [are] often quite *odd*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Here's these ducks I mentioned when discussing "King Kong II" (Konami has a thing for killer ducks, it seems). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But the enemies [are] *ducks*, crabs, insects, chess pieces, and, uh, occasionally weird things like *robots* or, uh, various bizarre things like, uh, disembodied *hands*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game certainly has its good qualities. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *graphics* [are] *very nice* [and] *crisp* [and] *detailed*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's certainly a better-looking game than '*Dragon* Quest'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here, of course, is the ice world - something that would become a, uh, very common theme in later games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On the [negative] side, the *battle* sequences [can] be a *little clunky* and *often* [just don't] *feel* right. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the N.P.C. interactions are [pretty *insipid*], [and] I [was never really] sure *why* I was really *doing* anything. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's objects you need [to] *complete* the game, but ya [never] really know *why*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This [is] a little frustrating. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *enemies* use these, sort of, uh, directionless *flash* [attacks]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You just saw one there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They'll *shave off* (like, oh) a good 50 points off your *health*, and there's *no* way you can *avoid* them or *defend* against 'em. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Esper Dream" *does* start getting [pretty] *tricky* towards the *end*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll [need] {to} be *constantly* using *magic* such as the *shield* magic or the *time stop* magic [in] order [to defeat] *enemies*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And since they have that *flash* magic, (which you have no *defense* against), you're gonna lose H.P. [and] Magic Points for [pretty] much every enemy you fight. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, since you [can't] heal or refill your *magic*, uh, going through these *dungeons* is less about *strategy* [and] *more about* simply having enough M.P. [and] H.P. [to] actually make it all the way [to] the end. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, *quite frankly*, some enemies take *way* too many hits [to] kill - even with the most powerful *weapon*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, these guys right here: look how many times I have to sit... -- hit 'em with a *bazooka* [before] they finally *die*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, *after* you've purchased all the best armor [and] *weapons* in the game, uh, the *money* really starts pouring *in* (though, of course, now there's nothing to [actually] *spend* [it] on). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, "Esper Dream" is *structured* more like a *Platformer* than [an] *R.P.G.*, with a series of distinct *worlds* and a boss [at the] end of each *one*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the last World right *here*, and it's really *tough*; the *enemies* in this level just *really pummel* you repeatedly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, all [in] all "Esper Dream" is a very creative, uh, very carefully made game, [but] it's *also*, sort of, clumsy [and] frustrating [at] the same time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the combat... uh, well, the controls in the combat scenes really do feel, sort of, awkward. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And a [lot of] the elements [in] the game don't really quite gel. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still*, ya have to give kudos for Konami for getting on the, uh, J.R.P.G. *bandwagon* so *early*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] it's interesting how you [can already] see certain elements become standards in J.R.P.G.s emerging at this early stage. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Esper Dream" was certainly never *released* in the U.S. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] is actually [an] unofficial translation [we're] looking at, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 While this is not a *great* game, it's *certainly* worth taking a look at if you're interested [in] the *history* of very early Japanese Role-Playing Games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 FamiCom Golf Japan Course 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 February 21 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Take a moment to enjoy this cool *title* screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yes, for the FamiCom Disk System, it's "FamiCom Golf: Japan Course" (the Golf Game so epic [it] needs its own pre-game *credits*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game was *published* by *Nintendo* but *once again* developed by the ever-reliable HAL Laboratory. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They must [have] been busy *guys*, having released [their] own game, "Eggerland", less than a month earlier. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] various play options, but, uh, none [of] them are really *too* exciting because (let's face it) this game really isn't that *interesting*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, the original Nintendo "Golf" from 1984 was one of the biggest sellers for the FamiCom in *Japan*, supposedly selling more copies than "...Legend of Zelda" [and] "Metroid" put together (if you [can] believe that). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, naturally, a sequel was in order. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the original, "Golf", right here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Nowadays, some folks complain [about] certain Sports series (such as the '...Madden Football' games), saying that, 'Each new entry is just a slight update to the earlier games, and they really keep putting 'em out [only] on a regular basis [to] keep the *money* pouring in.'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, I suppose Nintendo started that trend with *this* game because, as you can see, it's just a slight update on the original *1984* "Golf" game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The basic gameplay is *identical*, though it has been given a graphic [and] musical *overhaul*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The original "Golf" *had* no music during the game... just sound effects. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As before, you pick your club, use your arrow, uh, to [determine] how strong [and accurate] the swing will *be*, and swing the club to hit the ball. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] this case I (once again) get [it in] the water. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Probably the most *[interesting]* question [in] this game is 'Who's *this guy*?'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, he's not Mario nor Luigi. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Do] they have a third brother? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's better fr... -- than me; that's [for] sure. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Incredibly*, Nintendo released a *follow-up* [to] this game [only] four [months] later. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *yes*, Bandai has a Golf Game coming up before too long as *well*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Overall Golf Games [are] very [popular] on the FamiCom, and there are probably more of them released than any other *Sports* Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Trainer: Aerobics Studio 🇯🇵 // Dance Aerobics 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 February 21 🇯🇵 // 1989 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 // Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] last, it's another game in Bandai's 'Family *Trainer*' series, "...*Aerobics Studio*", released in the U.S. by *Nintendo* as "Dance *Aerobics*" (now with added synthesized speech!). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though [I'm not] really sure how I feel about the enormous sweat drops flying off the logo; [it's] a little disgusting. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If nothing else, "*Dance* Aerobics" is notorious for the hilariously dated *cover*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, that's how you were supposed to dress [for] aerobics, back then. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] what the hell is that guy [in] the middle left box doing? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There *was* an aerobics craze, back in the mid-'80s. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, naturally, there had to be a Family Trainer/Power Pad game [to] cash in. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [have] a number of *options* including some basic aerobics steps. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You start off with a nice little warm-up, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya always gotta remember [to] stretch [and] warm up [before] ya start exercising. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then, of course, it's basically just your standard 'Follow-the-Leader' type game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The one thing I *do* like about the game is the fact that *apparently* [your] exercise room is some sort of gigantic $10 million loft in a New York City High Rise. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe this is [supposed to] be "Flashdance"-inspired. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The main part [of] the game here has, sort of, repeated *routines* but there's also other games where I [think] they're more random. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But they're all, sort of, the same kind of 'Follow-the-Leader' 'Simon Says'-type games (or, as she even points out, 'Follow me!'). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} hard [to] say if this game actually [got any] housewives [or] kids actually doing aerobics. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [There's also, sort of], a music mo... -- [orientated] 'Simon Says'-like game which has you jumping around [and] hitting musical notes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, there, like all the 'Family Trainer' games, "Dance Aerobics" is developed by Human, who does, ya know, technically {a} [pretty] good job putting this thing together. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, all of this [has] led some [to] call "Dance Aerobics" very -- maybe the very first dance-based Rhythm Game, sort of, like a predecessor [to] "Dance Dance Revolution" [and] those sorts of things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This might be *true*, [but], '*So what*?'; "Dance Aerobics" is *still* [not] a very exciting game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pocket Zaurus: Ju Ouken no Nazo 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 February 27 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Over the course of 'Chrontendo' [we've] seen good games [as] well [as] many bad games, but we've [also] seen a lot [of] games [that] fall [into] that vast *middle* ground - games [that are] neither good nor bad - but [that] simply exist. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Bandai's "Pocket Zaurus: Ju Ouken no Nazo" is a quintessential example of [such a] title. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Developed by (who else?) Tose (the notorious [and] somewhat secretive Japanese contract developer), "Pocket Zaurus" is a *completely typical* straight ahead Platformer. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 According to this opening, uh -- this nebbishy looking character gets transformed into a little *dinosaur*, [and] then has [to] travel back in time to the year 100 million B.C. (smack dab [in] the middle of the *Cretaceous* period, when dinosaurs ruled the earth). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He then uses his little *Boomerang* [to fight his] way across the landscape, *presumably* in order [to] rescue a Princess of some sort. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Side-Scrolling Platform genre (which was [introduced to] the FamiCom about a year [and] a half earlier, "Super Mario Bros.") was in its difficult [and] formative years. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most Platformers released during this time, uh, period were [pretty] basic, and, uh, n... -- not too many deviated from the standard formula. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} wasn't *too* long [before] we see, uh, [some] *advances* in the Platform genre; games like "Mega Man" [and] "Bionic Commando" [introduced] some exciting new *concepts*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But in the meantime, we're mostly stuck with games like "Pocket Zaurus...". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If nothing else, I guess [it's] interesting [that] even as a dinosaur, you still wear glasses and... a bow tie. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, Tose does try [to] [liven] {it} up a bit by adding, sorta, a, uh, short rather *lame* Shoot-'em-Up sequence (as seen here). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The hit detection seems a li'l off, at times. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Strangely, uh, this enormous dinosaur which we're flying over *does* [seem to] resemble [that from] a [later] much *better* Platform Game, uh, "Bonk". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In a slight variation of the *' shoot the eye' theme*, you actually *kill* this dinosaur by firing one shot into the nostril (which [we'll] see in just [a] few moments here). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And of course, avoid the *spiderwebs* which are mysteriously floating in the air and [around] the dinosaur. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Like a lot of Tose games of this time, [there's] a [lot of] elements here [that] really don't make much sense. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, ya can't shoot the eye. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! One hit [to] the nostril [will] do the job. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It is a rather bizarre way [to] kill a boss, I [suppose]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, eventually our hero [will] go underground [and] battle a [set] of more, uh, s... uh -- bizarre, unusual monsters, including these, sort of, annoying *mole* creatures that dig, uh, *fatal* holes [in] the ground. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This boss [battle] isn't too bad, I suppose - nothing we haven't seen [before]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I do admit, that is a [pretty] weird cool background during the scene. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In terms of power-ups, you *will* eventually acquire a little dinosaur *battlesuit* that restores all your *health*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, and there's these arched windows (inside an underground cavern?). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Granted, uh, "Pocket Zaurus..." does have a [little bit] of character to [it]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The, uh, ending is unique. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You rescue the *Princess* and, uh, transform back [into your] human form. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But then it [turned] out the Princess *is* the demon that transformed you into a dinosaur [to] *begin* with. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then [she] turns you back into a dinosaur [before] flying away. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [while] "Pocket Zaurus..." is better than games like "Ultraman", it *still* fails [to] hold much interest today. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Marchen Veil 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 03 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by System Sacom | Sunsoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uhhh... Here's a... uh ...'nother release [from] Sunsoft (actually, uh, one of *two* [releases] this episode) [and] two more *next* episode; they're really cranking 'em out! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sunsoft definitely has some quality issues with their releases but *this [particular]* title is a little [different than] most. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Märchen Veil" is a [port] of the 1985 P.C.-88 game from System Sacom (a game company [not] really known for quality releases - at least at this point). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They will [eventually] release some games [for] the FamiCom, themselves, later on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Märchen Veil" apparently is *somewhat* well remembered by some Japanese gamers as being an early R.P.G. with a somewhat well-delineated plot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The story is told as a series of text [and] image tableaus (as we see here) at the beginning [of] each level, and they're labeled 'visual stages'... for some strange reason. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, oddly, the game's title is given as both the nonsensical "Märchen Veil" and "Merchen Veil" on different screens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Merchen' is German for 'fairytale', but what a 'merchen veil' is, I've absolutely no idea. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The original P.C.-88 version was apparently thought [to] have unusually well-done art, for the time, but there's certainly nothing well done about the art [in] *this* version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Merchen Veil" is *usually* classified by Japanese gamers as an Action-R.P.G., but... in reality, it is merely a pre-"...Zelda" Action-Adventure Game with some Fantasy elements thrown in (kinda similar to Hudson's "Challenger" game, also from 1985, (which we saw back in "Chrontendo Episode 5") 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this FamiCom version (which was perhaps [ported] by Sunsoft, themselves) suffers from kinda choppy scrolling and, uh, character *movement*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Honestly, you would think that by 1987 developers would have mastered the technical skills required [for] smooth scrolling on the FamiCom, but apparently, Sunsoft had not. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Interestingly, there was a "Märchen Veil 2" [but it] was never [ported to] the FamiCom, (unless this version actually contains both parts). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Märchen Veil" is a bit of a mess but still, sort of, {a} fascinating-*looking* title. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It certainly might be worth a closer look if anyone ever [decides to] *translate* it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ikinari Musician 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 05 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Musical Plan
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tokyo Shoseki 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here we have another [of] those oddball Japanese releases we all love: "Ikinari [Musician]"! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For a game about music, isn't [it] weird that there's no music in the [title] screen? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And "Ikinari Musician" is [not] a *game* but rather a, sort of, Virtual Synthesizer/Music Program (and one with a rather weird, arbitrary *rabbit* theme). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The game was [released] by the educational game *specialist*, Tokyo *Shoseki* (we've seen their educational [games on] the FamiCom [before]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [presumably developed] by these guys mentioned on the title screen, Musical Plan Limited (whoever the hell *they* are). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Their -- Their name *also* appears on one [of] the more infamous F.D.S. games: "Santa Claus no Takarabako". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (We'll be covering that game probably around "...Episode *22*" [or] so.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "*Ikinari* [Musician]" functions much like any very basic *keyboard* of the era. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You have] a few different instrument choices, some built-in demo tracks (and you [can] -- you [can] play over), and use the D-Pad [to] actually *move* the cursor around [and] play the keyboard *itself*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Moving the cursor up around -- [through] the *control*, [will] allow ya to ks... -- change things, uh, you know, instrument type, {and} so on, {and} so forth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Immediately] *above* the keyboard there's various selections [that] they control, sort of, the *quality* of the sound ([for] example, uh, give it, sort of, like a tremolo effect or whatnot). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] also affect how k... fast the notes are - eighth notes versus quarter notes, [and] so on {and} so forth. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And there [are] also (as I mentioned) pre-programmed tracks of different *genres*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You [can select] these by going to the *map* (though apparently Country and Western comes from Los Angeles, [or] maybe even *Baja*, according {to} *this* map). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (And again, what exactly is up with the damn rabbits?). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah yes, Northern Quebec: land of the Boogie! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, for, uh, an [individual] such as myself, with no musical training [or] *talent* this is just a rather silly noise-making toy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, for someone with some actual musical skills, uh, they could [probably] (in theory) make some cool little FamiCom-style musical *tracks* [with] this thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can record [and] *playback* [your] creations using the *mic* [and] reel-to-reel *tape* icons on the right-hand *side*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But anyone can certainly fool around with [it for] a *little* while and amuse themselves. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Lode Runner 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 05 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Irem
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We'll start up the F.D.S., here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And we'll just enjoy the music for a sec. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Probably [won't enjoy] the game *itself* too much.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And it's "Super Lode Runner" a game which *appears* {to} be *based* on *this* 1986 Irem *Arcade* title, (sometimes [referred] to as "Lode Runner *IV*" in the U.S.). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The levels of this *Arcade* Game *were* reused in "Super Lode Runner' [for] the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, at this time, Irem was having some *dealings* with the U.S. Computer giant, *Brøderbund*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (You might recall they released *"Spelunker"* [for] the FamiCom.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And they had, in fact, acquired the rights for the 'Lode Runner' franchise [for] Japanese use. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Thus, they started making their very own 'Lode Runner' *Arcade* Games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Super* Lode Runner"... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (And, ya know, this does show they were releasing games with the word *' Super'* in the title well [before] the Super FamiCom came out.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Super Lode Runner" is Irem's first 'Lode Runner' game for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They would also [release a] *sequel*, "Super Lode Runner *II*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, uh, what's the game *itself* like? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's [pretty] much just another 'Lode Runner' game (the third [for] the FamiCom after "Lode Runner" [and] "*Championship* Lode Runner"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It adheres, uh, s... -- [pretty] strictly [to] the "Lode Runner" formula, but you'll notice the *sprites* have changed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *robots* from, uh, the original "Lode Runner" [for] I, uh -- [for] the FamiCom by *Hudson*, no longer look like *Bomberman*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Presumably, Hudson owned the sprite design from their earlier 'Lode Runner' games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The idea is [to] collect [Gold] [and] avoid the enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] dig holes [that will] temporarily *stop* the enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [After] you've gotten all the Gold, a little ladder will appear [and] you climb up [to the] next *level*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] that's all there is to it! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [just] keep [repeating]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I think altogether, there's around 55 levels on this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, of course, these, uh, beginning levels here are [pretty] basic. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They do get much weirder [and] much more *complicated*, [and] much more, uh, puzzle-ish in later levels. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Since these games were [not developed] by the original *creators* of "Lode Runner", I'm not really sure how the Irem titles are thought of by 'Lode Runner' fans. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... I assume they sold okay in Japan... since "Lode Runner" was apparently enormously popular over there. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mickey Mouse: Fushigi no kuni no Daiboken 🇯🇵 // Mickey Mousecapade 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 06 🇯🇵 // 1988 October [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // Capcom 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our last game this *episode* is "Mickey *Mouse*..." and this is the third licensed title from *Hudson* after the dull "Ninja Hattori-kun" and the unspectacular "Doraemon". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, unlike those titles, this one is based on a property that is p... -- huge [pretty] much everywhere [in] the world: Disney's 'Mickey Mouse'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Mickey Mouse..." (or "Mickey Mouse: Big Adventure in *Wonderland*" to give [the] full title) is definitely subpar Hudson. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They don't really seem [to] put too much effort into the licensed titles, but it is {a} sometimes fun [and] sometimes frustrating little Platformer, consisting of five levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You control Mickey [while] Minnie follows *behind you*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the first thing you wanna do is [to get] some firepower. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once *this* is done, you'll be able [to] blast enemies [and find] the occasional hidden item (like [the] little Hudson bee, there). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Often, hitting windows [will uncover] an extra life, uh - though in this game you'll need [to] fire at [pretty] much everything in *sight*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, ya *might* notice in this game [that] some [of] the sprites seem a little [familiar], like those -- the little, uh, spiders there seem right [out of] "Adventure Island". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And Hudson *did*, sort of, (on occasion) reuse some [of] their sprites. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this was [not] the first 'Mickey Mouse' game; there was "Sorcerer's Apprentice" on the Atari *2600*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And there's also a title called "Mickey Mouse: Athletic World" for the rather obscure Japanese console, the Tomy *Pyūta*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But this is [pretty] much the first in a series of very [popular] games based on Disney characters released for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, going back [to] the game in question, in this first level, you, sort of, navigate around these little rooms here, uh, [mostly] looking for a *key* so ya [can get out] the door found at the very [beginning] of the level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the first boss, The Cheshire Cat. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game is more [or] less based around "Alice [in] Wonderland". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The object is to actually *rescue* Alice. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And a *[lot]* of the enemies [and] bosses are [based] on "Alice in Wonderland" *characters*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now playing, uh, the game on this first level here, ya might think "Mickey Mouse..." is, *sort of, a kids'* game and seems [pretty] *simple* (not really too difficult). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Compared [to] something [like] "Milon's Secret *Castle*", "Mickey Mouse..." seems like a cakewalk - *but* after the first *level*, the difficulty starts [steadily] increasing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *2nd Level* requires *far* more advanced jumping [and] enemy *dodging* skill and "Mickey Mouse..." just gets *harder* from here on *out*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In this level, it's quite easy to mistime your jumps and, uh, have Minnie land in the ocean ([remember], of course, she always follows right behind you). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, you have, sort of, the thing where, as you jump, enemies and waves start flying [at] you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, in *Japan*, Hudson Soft released this game *themselves*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... [But] by the time its U.S. version came out *Capcom* had apparently [already] obtained the rights [to] the Disney license, resulting in "Mickey Mouse" being released by *Capcom* as "Mickey *Mousecapade*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the U.S. version *title screen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Notice it still says "Mickey Mouse"; they didn't bother changing the *title screen* that much, but they did change most of the enemy sprites and all of the *bosses*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As a result, "Mickey Mousecapade" is *much less* "Alice in Wonderland" based. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Note the snakes there which seem (again) taken right out of "Adventure *Island*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game itself is [pretty] much identical other [than] the sprites. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, the first boss here apparently is (well, perhaps) the witch from "Snow White". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Mickey Mousecapade" uses a wider [variety] of Disney villains. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's an odd [part]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Minnie [can actually get] *kidnapped* by one enemy [and] you [have to] sort of *find* her among all these various Minnie Mouse *statues*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya need to] collect her before you could actually *exit* the first level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 By the *3rd Level*, the game start getting a bit more sinister [and] difficult. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Here's the 3rd Level boss, the [Caterpillar]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is, again, the Japanese version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [Pretty] tough [and] kinda similar to the bosses in "Milon's Secret Castle". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, Level 4 is even more sadistic; it's based on, uh, Neverland from "Peter Pan". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it's an incredibly [short] level ([only] four screens), but the villain, Captain Hook, is virtually *impossible* to [defeat] as he throws basically a solid wall of knives at you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S. version (which is, uh, [released] by Capcom, again), they've [changed] the villain to Peg-Leg Pete (he was, sort of, a standard 'M...' uh -- 'Mickey Mouse', uh, enemy). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Mickey Mouse..." is sort of a strange little game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} definitely not Hudson's best, by any means, but, uh, definitely a lot more [difficult] than you think it *might* be. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And it's definitely worth taking a look. 🍇🍌
