👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 53 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Welcome back, my friends, to the 🍋 retro gaming show that never ends. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And we have a very spooky 🍋 Halloween episode for you today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, man, it's been a long time, 🍋 as I discussed in my last video. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But here we all are: 🍋 December 1989 Part Two - 🍊 the last all-1989 episode 🍊 (since next time we'll 🍋 actually start in on 1990, 🍊 and you know what 1990 is - the 🍋 year the Super FamiCom debuted) 🍊 the last year that the plain old 🍋 FamiCom had the field all to itself. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, don't get me wrong, 🍊 the FamiCom remained in a very strong 🍋 position for a couple [of] years 🍊 (we won't even see a huge number 🍋 of Super FamiCom games being 🍋 released until December 1991) 🍊 but 1990 marks the beginning of 🍋 the end for the plucky little guy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And we'll be seeing a number of 🍋 big names soon making their final 🍋 8-bit appearances. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, we have one today - one of 🍋 everyone's favorite N.E.S. games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So let's get started in the 🍋 traditional 'Chrontendo' fashion 🍊 with some absolutely 🍋 terrible garbage games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ironsword: Wizards and Warriors II 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Zippo Games
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's start off today with some 🍋 U.S.-[only] games from December. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We don't know exactly when 🍋 these were released, 🍊 since video games in the U.S. 🍊 didn't really have official 🍋 street dates like they do now. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, according to Nintendo, 🍊 December is the official month 🍋 these things came out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First up, of course, is 🍋 "Ironsword: Wizards and Warriors II" 🍊 - which (just like the first game) 🍊 does not have any wizards 🍋 nor any 'Conan'-style warriors - 🍊 just a dude dressed up like one of 🍋 the Knights of the Round Table. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At least there is some magic in 🍋 this game, however. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Acclaim is the publisher and 🍋 Rare's name appears all over it, 🍊 but it seems to have been 🍋 primarily developed by Zippo Games 🍊 (which was a company 🍋 Rare used to make games 🍊 when Rare themselves 🍋 couldn't be bothered to). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Coincidentally, Zippo was 🍋 also founded by two brothers 🍊 and (just like Rare) 🍋 they started out making 🍋 computer games in England 🍊 before switching 🍋 over to the N.E.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if "Ironsword..." 🍋 is remembered today, 🍊 it's mostly for the game's box art 🍊 since the model for the cover painting 🍋 is none other than Fabio Lanzoni. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Fabio was a small-time actor and 🍋 frequent model for romance novels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He wasn't really well known when 🍋 "Ironsword..." first came out 🍊 but in the early '90s 🍋 people started noticing that 🍊 the same guy was on all these 🍋 romance novel covers 🍊 and he became something 🍋 like a prototypical meme. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In 1993 he attempted to transition 🍋 into a full-blown celebrity 🍊 with guest appearances on T.V. shows, 🍊 releasing romance novels 🍋 written under his own name, 🍊 putting out an album, 🍊 appearing in commercials for 🍋 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter', 🍊 though the public got tired 🍋 of him relatively quickly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, in 1999, when he made the news 🍋 by getting hit in the face by a bird 🍊 while on a roller coaster - 🍊 that was [pretty] much the last 🍋 time anyone ever heard of him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though he does still turn up 🍋 from time to time in campy 🍊 'Hey do you remember this guy?' 🍋 kind of roles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, what about the game itself? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, just like the first 🍋 "Wizards and Warriors", 🍋 it's [pretty] bad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the surface, this might appear 🍋 to be an Action Adventure Game 🍊 (something like the 🍋 "Castlevania" series). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍋 It's not quite like that, though. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's almost entirely about jumping 🍊 and the game's levels are 🍋 very vertically orientated. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's like Zippo made 🍋 a Platform Game 🍊 and decided it should be 🍋 exclusively dedicated to 🍊 jumping from one 🍋 platform to the other. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's what you do in this game: 🍋 jump from platform to platform. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Lots of games will use, 🍋 like, one part of a level 🍊 that looks like this 🍊 (like, maybe you're on a mountain and 🍋 you have to do some ledge jumping - 🍊 or you're in a jungle 🍋 and you have to jump 🍊 from branch to branch 🍋 in the trees) 🍊 but, here, that's 🍋 almost all you do 🍋 throughout the entire game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are six levels: 🍊 a mountain, 🍋 a sky level, 🍊 a forest level, 🍋 an underwater level, 🍊 and a volcano level, 🍋 and then a cave level, 🍊 as well as a very short final 🍋 level on a second mountain. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's very little 🍋 variation within each level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, luckily, you can't 🍋 fall to your death here - 🍊 but you can very easily 🍋 miss a platform 🍊 and plummet back down to 🍋 the bottom of the level, 🍊 requiring you to jump 🍋 all the way back up again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And these levels are designed to 🍋 make this very very easy to do. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Missing a platform often results 🍋 in you landing on, like, 🍊 a curved surface or a slide-like 🍋 surface that drops you down to... 🍊 from one slide to the other 🍋 until you hit the ground 🍊 (just like you were playing 🍋 "Chutes and Ladders" or something). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Other things I hate about 🍋 "Ironsword...": the enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The approach is 🍋 the exact opposite 🍊 of how a game like "Ninja Gaiden" 🍋 or "Castlevania" works. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies in those are always fair; 🍊 you can avoid them or kill them 🍋 (if you're quick enough) 🍊 and time your jumps 🍋 and attacks correctly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sometimes that can 🍋 be very difficult 🍊 but they - they never 🍋 overwhelm you with cheap hits. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Ironsword..." takes 🍋 the opposite approach. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It bombards you non-stop with 🍊 enemies which seemingly appear 🍋 randomly from all directions, 🍋 including from above. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the thing is that you actually 🍋 can't attack enemies above you; 🍊 your character has no way to 🍋 attack something above his head. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, on top of all this, 🍊 off-screen enemies can 🍋 shoot you with projectiles 🍊 and they do this constantly, 🍊 including when you're actually 🍋 jumping from platform to platform 🍋 in mid-jump. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At least, this happens 🍋 in the first level; 🍊 the game actually mellows out 🍋 a bit as you make some progress. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the forest level, there are 🍋 way fewer surprise attacks 🍊 and just way fewer 🍋 enemies in general - 🍊 and this level has 🍋 so many health refills. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The drop in difficulty 🍋 and frustration 🍊 from the first two levels 🍋 to level three is just bizarre. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So basically how 🍋 each level works is 🍊 you're supposed to explore 🍋 all the nooks and crannies 🍊 until you find some special item which 🍋 you can then use to exit the level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 in the forest level, 🍋 this dude wants a bug. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The bug can [only] be reached 🍋 by finding the waterspout spell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This spell can be found 🍋 inside this chest but 🍊 (and I have no idea whether 🍋 this is a programming glitch 🍋 or done deliberately, but...) 🍊 once you are holding the spell 🍋 you will then lose it 🍊 (it'll actually disappear 🍋 from your inventory) 🍊 if you enter any doors or 🍋 touch any health refills. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It will literally just vanish 🍋 with no warning whatsoever. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Neither the manual 🍋 nor the game itself 🍊 mentions that this 🍋 is going to happen, 🍊 so I suspect that 🍊 this was not deliberate 🍋 and was a programming error. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another thing the manual 🍋 fails to mention is that, 🍊 while chickens refill your health, 🍊 there are slightly larger chickens 🍋 that make you lose health - 🍊 no idea why. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are 🍋 some other elements here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You eventually get the ability to 🍋 use magic, find better armor, ... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to collect keys 🍋 to open chests, 🍊 but this doesn't really dispel 🍋 the total monotony of this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Everything is so 🍋 ugly and dull-looking. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even the final bosses 🍋 are just, like, 🍊 round blobs that fly around you 🍋 in a circle and shoot at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All this stuff doesn't really fly 🍋 in a game from, like, late 1989; 🍊 we expect more, by this point. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as it turns out, 🍋 "Ironsword..." 🍊 is not the [only] awful game 🍋 from Acclaim this time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nope! 🍋 Let's move on to the next one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Raffaele Cecco | Gremlin Intreractive
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh man, oh man, oh man... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's move on to another Acclaim game 🍋 "Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is not a 🍋 cyborg-themed Fighting Game, 🍊 but rather a horizontal 🍋 Shoot-'em-Up (sort of). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, there's no 🍋 music during the title screen, 🍊 which is always a good sign. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there might have been a 🍋 bit of communication problem 🍊 when making this game, 🍊 since this screen says you are 🍋 out to kill all the 'Baykor' pirates 🍊 and the manual says you're 🍋 going after 'Zoggian' pirates. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Generally speaking, science fiction 🍋 Shoot-'em-Ups have you 🍊 defending your home planet against 🍋 a alien invasion force or something. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But here it appears the bad guys 🍋 merely [stole] some jewels that 🍋 were hidden in a remote asteroid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So essentially you're on a 🍋 mission of bloody vengeance - 🍊 based purely on 🍋 some property theft. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so here's 🍋 how the game begins: 🍊 lovely color scheme..., uh, 🍊 many game design elements 🍋 here are [pretty] weird, 🍊 starting with that volcano 🍋 straight out of "Gradius". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Except this volcano 🍊 (and all the other volcanoes 🍋 that appear in the game) 🍊 are purely decorational(?); 🍊 they serve no function at all 🍋 and they actually can't hurt you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like... 🍋 Those boulders flying out, there, 🍊 will actually pass 🍋 harmlessly through your ship, 🍊 so I don't know why 🍋 these volcanoes even exist. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another unusual element here is that 🍋 gravity pulls your ship downward. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So if you stop moving, 🍊 your ship will begin to fall 🍋 towards the bottom of the screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a bit hard to 🍋 explain "Cybernoid..."; 🍊 it appears to be a 🍋 very basic Shoot-'em-Up - 🍊 and, considered as such, 🍋 it fails miserably. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are very limited types of 🍋 enemies, no bosses, no scrolling; 🍊 the entire game is just a 🍋 series of one-screen rooms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's absolutely nothing here 🍋 to amaze you or dazzle you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's really nothing 🍋 at all of visual interest 🍊 (compared to last episode's 🍋 "Abadox", for example); 🍊 this is a spectacularly 🍋 dull Shooter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And when you factor in 🍋 what might be perceived as 🍊 the game's excessive 🍋 difficulty and unfairness 🍊 it's tempting to call this the 🍋 worst Shoot-'em-Up on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And it feels like an example 🍋 of kusoge from late 1985 🍊 from Towa Chiki or something, 🍊 rather than a game that would 🍋 be released at the end of 1989. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the game makes 🍋 a bit more sense, 🍊 once you realize this is a 🍋 port of a Z.X. Spectrum game, 🍊 published by Hewson in 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The original was created 🍋 by one Raffaele Cecco. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Spectrum was not really 🍋 the best platform 🍊 for exciting or 🍋 graphically-demanding Action Games, 🍊 which is why "Cybernoid..." 🍋 is divided up into 🍊 a series of separate rooms, 🍋 rather than long scrolling levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And "Cybernoid..." was, of course, 🍊 ecstatically reviewed by 🍋 U.K. game publications. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Who needs 16-bit graphics when 🍋 Z.X. Spectrum games look this good?", 🍊 according to 'Crash' magazine. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And 'Your Sinclair' rated it as the 🍋 s... 36th greatest game of all time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this N.E.S. port was 🍋 done by Gremlin Graphics - 🍊 a British developer from Sheffield 🍋 who released tons of computer games 🍊 and became successful enough 🍋 to purchase D.M.A. Designs 🍊 (who, of course, later got 🍋 purchased by Take-Two 🍊 and became Rockstar North - 🍊 going on to make the 🍋 'Grand Theft Auto' games). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As for Gremlin themselves, 🍊 they eventually got 🍋 bought out by Infogrames 🍊 and was shuttered 🍋 in the early 2000s. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So the upshot of all this is, 🍊 you can't really treat "Cybernoid..." 🍋 as a normal Shoot-'em-Up, 🍊 like you would play 🍋 in an Arcade game 🍊 or on the, uh, the N.E.S. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, it might be better thought 🍋 of as a Shooter-Puzzle hybrid. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Every time you enter a new room 🍋 you need to, sort of, figure out 🍊 how to get to the other side 🍋 of the room without dying. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your default weapon is an 🍋 extremely ineffective peashooter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But you have bombs, 🍊 an extremely useful 🍋 (though very limited) shield, 🍊 a bouncer that, uh, bounces off 🍋 destructive bouncing balls 🍋 in several directions, 🍊 as well as a weapon that simply 🍋 kills all on-screen enemies 🍊 (which the developers 🍋 unfortunately named 'genocide' 🍊 - yeah they actually 🍋 called it 'genocide'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also very useful is this, sort of, 🍋 "Gradius"-like Option thing 🍋 that orbits around your ship. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So basically 🍋 whenever you enter a room, 🍊 you need to decide 🍋 how to get [across] 🍊 and if you'll need to use 🍋 any special weapons to do so. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's [only] three levels in total 🍊 (two short ones and 🍋 then one longer one). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then there are 🍋 hidden items as well, 🍊 most notably at the end 🍋 of the first two levels - 🍊 where, if you shoot this switch, 🍋 a powerup will be released 🍊 that turns your ship into, 🍋 like, this mech-looking thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, more importantly, 🍊 this mech ship has, uh, 🍋 much more special weapons usages. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 you can use the shield five times 🍋 rather than the normal two. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, weirdest of all, is that 🍊 normally your shield 🍋 [only] lasts a few seconds 🍊 so it's very useful but 🍋 it disappears very quickly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, when you're 🍋 powered up in mech form, 🍊 you can use the shield in the 🍋 first room of the new level 🍊 and the shield will somehow last 🍋 for the entire first six rooms 🍋 of Levels 2 and 3. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's really no reason 🍋 why it seems to do this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean if you use it again afterwards, 🍋 it'll [only] last like five seconds. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But you can actually 🍋 use the shield 🍊 to just blow through the first 🍋 six rooms of Levels 2 and 3. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this accounts for something 🍋 like a third of Level 2 and a... 🍋 a nice chunk of Level 3. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the weird thing is, 🍊 none of this is actually 🍋 documented anywhere in the manual, 🍊 other than a reference 🍋 to hidden items. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So in... in some sense, 🍋 "Cybernoid..." is [pretty] short. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A speedrun beat it in less than 🍋 six minutes with no shortcuts - 🍊 just buzzing through the rooms 🍋 as efficiently as possible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And a good normal player who 🍋 knows about the special mech suit 🍊 could get through this in, 🍋 I'm sure, less than 10 minutes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are, however, a lot of 🍋 unpleasant or unfair things 🍊 that will frustrate the 🍋 novice "Cybernoid..." player. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, for example, here - 🍋 getting past these things 🍊 is a major pain since (uh, 🍋 at least on the N.E.S. port) 🍊 gravity pulls your ship down slightly 🍋 faster than those blocks move. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, when you're passing through 🍋 the downward-moving blocks, 🍊 you need to move up ever so 🍋 slightly for just a split-second 🍊 to avoid actually falling 🍋 into the bottom block. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I'm... I'm sure a lot 🍋 of kids could not get through 🍊 the first screen that uses these, 🍊 which happens at the very 🍋 beginning of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you might think it's weird to 🍋 throw in such a tough challenge 🍊 (uh, like, three screens 🍋 into the game) 🍊 but unlike, you know, titles like 🍋 "Super Mario Bros." or "Castlevania", 🍊 "Cybernoid..." doesn't 🍋 really start off simply 🍊 and increase the difficulty 🍋 as it progresses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It starts off hard 🍋 and then adds, kind of, like, 🍊 a few additional moving parts 🍋 as it goes along. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But there's not really 🍋 that much difference 🍊 between the first few 🍋 rooms of the game 🍊 and the last few rooms. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there is definitely a lot of 🍋 unfair stuff in "Cybernoid...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemy ships tend to move very fast 🍋 and come at you in large numbers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your laser is a bit slow and not 🍋 very effective at taking enemies out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But that wouldn't be such a huge problem 🍋 if the enemies flew in patterns. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, on many of these 🍋 screens where you have, like, 🍊 a horde of enemies just, sort of, 🍋 flying right towards you, 🍊 their positions are actually randomized 🍊 (which means that if you reach 🍋 the far side of the screen, 🍊 it is quite possible for a ship 🍋 to enter, right in front of you, 🍋 and hit you with no warning). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And these unavoidable deaths 🍋 are, of course, completely unfair 🍊 but that's just 🍋 the way the game rolls. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So is "Cybernoid..." the worst 🍋 Shoot-'em-Up on the N.E.S.? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, maybe. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's one of the ugliest, 🍋 the most oddly designed, 🍊 and the least enjoyable 🍋 Shooters on the N.E.S. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you figure out how to play it, it's 🍋 not as bad as it appears at first glance 🍊 but this is certainly not a game 🍋 I would recommend to anyone, 🍊 except out of morbid curiosity. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Uncanny X-Men 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Pixel
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by LJN 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So here we have one of the 🍋 most infamous U.S. N.E.S. games: 🍊 one that disappointed countless 🍋 kids on Christmas Day 1989, I'm sure. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the '80s 'The X-Men' 🍋 were a hot property for Marvel - 🍊 at least in terms 🍋 of comic book sales, 🍊 if not name recognition 🍋 by the general public. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'X-Men' were not originally 🍋 A-list characters, 🍊 but during the 🍋 late '70s to early '80s 🍊 the creative team of 🍋 Chris Claremont and John Byrne 🍊 turned it into one of 🍋 Marvel's most popular titles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Over the course of the decade, 🍋 Claremont gradually lost his mind 🍊 and the comic took a rather 🍋 unpleasant sadistic turn to it - 🍊 but still remained 🍋 immensely popular. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Near the end of 1989, 🍊 there was a standalone animated 🍋 special called "Pride of The X-Men" 🍊 that aired during 🍋 'Marvel Action Universe' 🍊 which was Marvel's rather bizarre 🍋 Saturday morning cartoon show, 🍊 which combined old episodes of 🍋 'Spider-Man' and 'Fantastic Four' 🍊 with newer cartoons such as 🍋 'Dino Riders' and 'Robocop'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, 🍋 a couple years later, 🍊 'The X-Men' would get 🍋 their own weekly cartoon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's not really much to say 🍋 about "...X-Men" as a game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You choose to play one of four levels, 🍋 and then you pick two characters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're doing the 1-Player mode, 🍊 the second character is 🍋 controlled by the C.P.U. - 🍊 which is absolutely worthless. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So the second character will 🍋 usually get killed very quickly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of the six characters, three 🍋 (Cyclops, Storm, and Iceman) 🍊 have ranged attacks 🍋 (which is good) 🍊 while Wolverine, 🍋 Nightcrawler, and Colossus 🍊 have melee attacks 🍋 (which is very very bad). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At least some characters 🍋 have a special ability. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nightcrawler can walk through walls 🍊 (which makes me wonder if he was 🍋 originally intended to be Kitty Pryde). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of you probably know 🍊 this game is universally 🍋 considered to be quite terrible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, it's difficult to really 🍋 produce much analysis of 🍊 "The Uncanny X-Men", simply because 🍋 there's really not much game here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You see this stuff here? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's basically it; 🍋 you've seen the entire game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each of the four levels 🍋 are very similar - 🍊 a series of vertically 🍋 scrolling screens 🍊 in which you are attacked by 🍋 enemies on a constant basis. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The backgrounds change 🍋 for each level, 🍊 the enemy sprites change, 🍋 but the game itself does not. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The manual tells you what 🍋 each level is supposed to be. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a ruined city 🍊 (which Magneto is fortifying 🍋 to make his base of operations 🍋 on Earth, apparently). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the manual never bothers to 🍋 tell us anything about the enemies; 🍊 and in-game they are not identifiable 🍋 as anything related to the comic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Instead, they're simply 🍊 a random assortment of 🍋 generic video game monsters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are various objects 🍋 that appear on a regular basis, 🍊 throughout each level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The magnets will cause you 🍋 to freeze for a moment. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The lightning bolt 🍋 clears the screen of all enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Those little things [that] look 🍋 kind of like an "E", uh, 🍊 refill some of your health. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A similar-looking "S"-shaped item 🍋 freezes the enemies temporarily. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, best of all, is a 🍋 temporary-invincibility item, 🍊 which is great because, you know, 🍋 you c... when you have it, 🍊 you can just run towards 🍋 the end of the level 🍋 as quickly as possible 🍊 and cut down the amount of 🍋 time spent playing this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There're also keys 🍋 needed to unlock doors. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At the end of each level is a boss; 🍋 this is 'Boomerang', I believe. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is rather odd. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I died once fighting this boss, 🍊 but when I came back here 🍋 to try again he was gone; 🍊 he just never reappeared. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I could just walk up and 🍋 grab the item he dropped 🍊 and leave on to 🍋 the next level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here's the odd thing: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the screen you get 🍋 when you beat the first level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The text is all white, 🍊 but it's supposed to have certain 🍋 letters appear in red text. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have to kill a 🍋 certain number of enemies 🍊 for the red text to appear. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After you beat all four levels 🍊 there doesn't appear to be 🍋 any sort of ending. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, in a very very odd game mechanic, 🍊 the last level is accessed 🍋 by beating all four levels 🍊 and then entering a secret code 🍋 on the Stage Select screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You obtain part of the code by 🍊 putting together the red letters 🍋 on the outro screen of each level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the rest of the code is... 🍋 printed on the cartridge label. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Putting in the code takes you 🍋 to the hidden fifth level 🍊 where you fight Magneto. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not really clear who 🍋 is responsible for this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 L.J.N. seems to have 🍋 contracted Japanese companies 🍊 to produce their games - 🍋 most notably Atlas 🍊 (who then seemingly subcontracted at 🍋 least some of them to other companies). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Game Developer Research Institute 🍋 has found evidence that 🍋 Pixel was involved in this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And some very smart folks 🍋 have noticed that the, uh, 🍊 Bothtec game, "Topple Zip" 🍊 (which I unfortunately 🍋 covered in "...Episode 23"), 🍊 shares sound effects 🍋 with '...X-Men'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This has led some folks 🍋 to conclude that Bothtec 🍋 was behind "...X-Men", 🍊 but more likely it means that 🍋 Pixel developed both games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Either way, "...X-Men" 🍋 is a classic example of quickie 🍋 low-end Japanese game design. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It even uses the same sprite 🍋 for all six X-Men; 🍋 [only] the colors are changed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So Storm and Colossus appear to have 🍋 about the same amount of body mass, 🍋 for example. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies just appear out of nowhere 🍋 and move around randomly; 🍊 there's really nothing that 🍋 qualifies as a 'game design', here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just kind of 🍋 random stuff thrown together 🍋 with no rhyme or reason 🍊 and it managed to be both 🍋 too difficult and boring, 🍋 at the same time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So anyways, 🍋 sorry if this caused anyone to 🍋 [relive] some childhood trauma. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's move on to some 🍋 hypothetically less-terrible games. 🍇🍌

✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay! Moving along, 🍋 moving along, moving along... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here is technically a good game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I can't get too excited about it 🍋 but it's better than "Cybernoid". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Published by Activision, it's 🍋 "Archon: The Light and The Dark". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Kind of a sick little 🍋 animated title screen here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the game of chess had 🍋 been around for millennia 🍊 however mankind is always 🍋 finding ways to improve chess 🍊 by adding in 🍋 lots of extra stuff. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the good folks at 🍋 Free Fall Associates said, 🍊 'Hey! Wouldn't chess be way cooler 🍋 if we made it a bit more like 🍋 "Dungeons & Dragons?". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, rather than your 🍋 boring bishops and rooks, 🍊 we have various 🍋 fantasy beings and monsters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here's the worst part; 🍋 cover your ears. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Holy crap! That's annoying. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now listen; "Archon", I guess, 🍋 is a -- a fine game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I have nothing against it, however 🍋 it's not really the game for me. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I have no plans to study "Archon", 🍊 so if you're-looking for 🍋 some detailed breakdown 🍊 of the game's many subtleties 🍋 then check elsewhere. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I will give you, sort of, like, 🍋 a basic rundown on how it works, though. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, this is a port 🍋 of a [pretty] old game 🍊 (at least old by 🍋 '80s gaming standards). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Archon" was an enormously popular 🍋 computer game released in 1983 🍊 by (are you ready for this?) 🍋 Electronic Arts, those bastards. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was developed by 🍋 Free Fall Associates - 🍊 a game company founded by 🍋 John Freeman and Anne Westfall. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Get it? 🍋 'Freeman' 'Westfall'🍋 'Free Fall'?) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It came out on every 🍋 conceivable computer platform 🍊 and was a massive hit - 🍊 one of those archetypal 🍋 '80s computer games 🍊 like "Zork" or something. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Six years later, 🍋 it found its way to the N.E.S. 🍊 with, uh, greatly revised graphics, 🍋 ported by Bulletproof Software 🍊 (famous for their involvement 🍋 in the "Tetris" licensing saga). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, it seems some sound work 🍋 was done by Goblin Sound. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, as you can see, "Archon" 🍋 is played on a chessboard 🍊 and the concept is 🍋 very similar to chess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your pawns are out front 🍊 (or rather your knights and goblins 🍋 are out front, in this case). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Stronger pieces are in the back row. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You, win either by 🍋 wiping out the opposing side 🍊 or, more simply, by 🍋 capturing the five power points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Those are those five pulsing 🍋 squares you see, there). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While in chess both sides 🍋 have the same pieces, 🍊 in "Archon" there are differences 🍋 between the light and the dark sides. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Light has knights, wizards, 🍋 golems, valkyries, and so on - 🍊 while dark has goblins, 🍋 sorceresses, trolls, banshees - 🍊 you get the idea. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While there are analogous 🍋 pieces on both sides 🍊 (wizards and sorcerers 🍋 are very similar, for example) 🍊 light and dark do 🍋 play a bit differently 🍊 and each side has its 🍋 strengths and its weaknesses. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the huge huge way 🍋 this differs from chess 🍊 is you can't just take a 🍋 piece by occupying its space. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nope! 🍋 You must defeat it 🍋 on the field of battle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In my opinion, this is probably 🍋 the weakest part of the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You run around shooting fireballs 🍋 or whatever at your opponent 🍊 until one of you dies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It feels kind of janky and, 🍊 while there is an 🍋 element of skill involved, 🍊 the weak piece will usually 🍋 get beaten by a stronger piece. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Certain pieces 🍋 (such as knights and goblins) 🍋 can [only] use melee attacks 🍊 and others (such as the phoenix) 🍋 can become temporarily invincible 🍋 while it damages an opponent. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So there are certainly sit... 🍋 situations where one piece 🍋 will be totally outmatched. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's other elements as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Wizards and sorcerers 🍋 have magic abilities 🍊 and can do things like teleport, 🍋 summon elementals, revive fallen pieces, 🍊 or imprison enemy pieces 🍊 (basically freezing them 🍋 for a couple turns). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, as an additional element, 🍊 the spaces on the board 🍋 change color over time, 🍊 which weakens or strengthens 🍋 the pieces and their abilities. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Overall, it's a [pretty] tricky game 🍋 to pick up [at] first - 🍊 lots of little subtleties to learn. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It doesn't really feel 🍋 like a Console game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, I think this is 🍋 the [only] console port - 🍊 so we won't ever be seeing this 🍋 in 'Chronsega' or 'Chronturbo'. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Short Order | Egg-splode 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, last U.S.-[only] game 🍋 this episode and it's a weird one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not even one game; 🍊 it's two separate games 🍋 released on one cart: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Short Order" and "Egg-splode". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I like this great animated 🍋 title screen here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, Power Pad fans, 🍊 I regret to inform you that this 🍋 is the last official Power Pad Game 🍊 to be released for 🍋 the FamiCom or N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Three years after Bandai published 🍋 "Athletic World" in Japan, 🍊 the Power Pad peripheral 🍋 is officially dead. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It had actually been dead 🍋 in Japan for a while. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A few games were released in 1987 🍋 and after that just two more from Bandai 🍊 (both of which were 🍋 T.V. show spin-off games) 🍊 with "Rai Rai! Kyonshis"  🍋 (a hopping vampire game) 🍊 being very last one, 🍋 released in January of 1989. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the U.S., [only] five 🍋 Power Pad titles had hit the shelves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So I assume Nintendo wanted to 🍋 put something out for Christmas 🍊 for people who, you know, had a Pad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, Nintendo of America 🍋 had heavily pushed the Power Pad 🍊 (basically dropping R.O.B. and 🍋 hyping the Power Pad, instead). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They released a Power Set bundle 🍊 that included the console, 🍋 the Zapper, and the Power Pad in 1988. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it seemed like everyone 🍋 had one, at the time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But still, there are 🍋 [only] a few games you 🍋 could actually use it with. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, for this reason, 🍊 "Short Order" is one of the very few 🍋 Nintendo-published N.E.S. games 🍊 that were developed 🍋 exclusively for the U.S. market. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, since Nintendo of America didn't 🍋 really have a game development division, 🍊 all of these U.S.-[only] titles 🍋 were outsourced to guys like Rare 🍊 (or, in this case, Tose). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yep "Short Order" | "Egg-splode" 🍊 is the first time Tose produced 🍋 a game for Nintendo themselves 🍊 (at least that we know of). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, of all the many many 🍋 Nintendo-published titles 🍊 for the N.E.S., this [has] gotta 🍋 be one of the most minor ones. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's two cute very basic 🍋 Power Pad Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Short Order" is 🍋 essentially "Simon"; 🍊 you just hop around to select the 🍋 correct ingredients to make a hamburger. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each time you complete a round, 🍊 another ingredient is 🍋 added on to the burger. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it's really just 🍋 a basic memory game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Egg-splode" is more 🍋 of a reflexes game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Foxes place bombs below 🍋 the hens in the henhouse. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to squish the bomb 🍋 before it explodes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Jumping on the correct space 🍊 allows you to somehow destroy 🍋 the bomb by crushing it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's not normally 🍋 how you defuse a bomb... 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, you need to avoid squishing 🍋 the eggs that chickens lay. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After a bit, the egg will hatch 🍋 and the chick will fly out 🍊 (which is not really, uh, how it's 🍋 normally done in a henhouse either). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if you beat a level, 🍊 this incredibly 🍋 unenthusiastic dog comes out, 🍊 holding up the sign 🍋 that says 'Good'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This dog just puts so little 🍋 effort into congratulating you; 🍊 he's, like, almost 🍋 passive-aggressive about it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Egg-splode" gets faster and 🍋 faster as you beat levels, 🍊 requiring you to jump around 🍋 [pretty] quickly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I'm 99% sure this was 🍋 sort of a bone thrown to parents. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Because, you know, pl... 🍋 after playing a few rounds of this 🍊 the kids would just become completely 🍋 exhausted and be ready for a nap). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is not rare or valuable 🍊 but it seems like it's 🍋 barely remembered today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Among Nintendo-published games, 🍋 it's relatively obscure. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It [only] has two reviews 🍋 on GameFAQs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I don't recall any of the 🍋 various angry-type video game 🍋 dudes discussing this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo, themselves, doesn't 🍋 really seem to have promoted it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, despite being (again) 🍋 actually published by Nintendo, 🍊 it [only] got a single page in 🍋 'Nintendo Power', 🍊 and then it was 🍋 never mentioned again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yet it's not really terrible; 🍊 I mean it has nice 🍋 graphics and sound. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I'm not gonna call it 🍋 'a lost gem' or anything like that 🍊 but it's not awful crap either. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 I Love Softball 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 19 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by C-Dream | Marionette
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Coconuts Japan 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So anyway, folks, 🍊 I apologize but this episode 🍋 is structured kind of strangely. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All the good games are in 🍋 the last third of the episode 🍊 and, as for this middle section, 🍊 we have three baseball games 🍋 in a row and a football game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, all four came out 🍋 on December 19th 🍋 by some weird coincidence. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First up, is "I Love Softball" 🍋 from Coconuts Japan, 🍊 and apparently developed 🍋 by Marionette. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Coconuts Japan is mostly known 🍋 for their Pachinko games, 🍊 though we've also seen a 🍋 pinball game from them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And they're also known for 🍊 releasing one of the very 🍋 last FamiCom games in Japan 🍊  - a Pachinko-based game 🍋 that came out in May 1994. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So anyway, of these 🍋 three baseball games 🍊 two are [pretty] boring 🍋 and the third is... just weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "I Love Softball" 🍋 is... sort of boring. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a girls' softball game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you may have noticed, 🍊 the box art focuses on 🍋 one of the players' asses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Has a lot of the same issues that 🍋 most FamiCom baseball games have, 🍊 as well as some unique ones. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Right off the bat, 🍊 we have the normal issue of the 🍋 1-Player mode being ridiculously unfair, 🍊 as the C.P.U. will effortlessly 🍋 catch 90% of your hits. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Whereas, when they're at the bat, 🍊 the C.P.U. will routinely 🍋 hit them right into the stands. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or, rather, they'll just 🍋 hit the back wall and bounce off; 🍊 I didn't see any actual 🍋 Home Runs while playing this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Other issues: 🍊 You can't see where 🍋 your outfielders are 🍊 'til the camera follows 🍋 the ball all the way to the 🍋 back of the playing field 🍊 (which obviously makes 🍋 catching balls [pretty] difficult). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is technically softball 🍋 so your pitches are underhand, 🍊 and I'm not sure 🍋 I understand them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I threw a lot of pitches that 🍋 went right over the plate 🍊 but were declared 'Ball's. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, sometimes the C.P.U.'s batters 🍋 just wouldn't swing the bat much - 🍊 and it's [pretty] unusual 🍋 to strike out the C.P.U. 🍊 on these FamiCom baseball games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Marionette was not considered 🍋 a high-end developer, 🍊 so this might just be 🍋 kinda wonky programming. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For the most part, though, 🍋 aside from the girls' softball angle, 🍊 this is an unremarkable and 🍋 [pretty] much totally forgotten 🍋 FamiCom baseball game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Emoyan no 10-bai Pro Yakyuu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 19 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hect
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hect 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, here's 🍋 baseball game number two, 🍊 a real oddity: 🍋 "Emoyan no 10-bai Pro Yakyuu" 🍋 from Hector. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you may have figured out, 🍊 based on the depiction of 🍋 the guy on the title screen, 🍊 this is a game based on a 🍋 real-life baseball player. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now we have the typical 🍋 fake team names here: 🍊 the 'Tires' are supposed 🍋 to be the Hanshin Tigers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'Smiles' 🍋 are the Yakult Swallows 🍊 (and yes this is Yakult, as in 🍋 the guys who make the yogurt). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like most FamiCom 🍋 baseball games at this time, 🍊 you can customize things 🍋 quite a bit by 🍊 changing the players' names, 🍋 deciding on the batting order, 🍋 and so on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 All of this looks 🍋 [pretty] uneventful so far, 🍊 but once you start the game 🍊 that's when things 🍋 get a little bit odd. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I'd like to give this credit 🍊 for completely 🍋 throwing out the rulebook 🍊 when it comes to 8-bit 🍋 baseball game design. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You bat and pitch from the 🍋 first-person viewpoint - 🍊 and there is this rather odd 🍋 interface for positioning your bat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That rectangle on the right 🍋 lays out where you can swing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You then use the D-Pad 🍋 to move the smaller rectangle 🍊 to swing high, middle, or low 🍋 (or to the left or right). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The pitcher then throws the ball 🍋 and you may or may not get a hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When you do, the camera switches to 🍋 this rather unusual ¾ perspective. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, pitching is just the opposite. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You select where you want to pitch 🍊 - again using the little 🍋 rectangle on the right. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned earlier, 🍊 this game uses the likeness and 🍋 name of real-life baseball player, 🍊 Takenori Emoto 🍋 (the 'Emoyan' of the title). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He played for the Hanshin Tigers 🍋 and, after retiring in 1981, 🍊 wrote a very popular book 🍋 about baseball called, 🍊 プロ野球を10倍楽しく見る方法🍋 ("How To Make Professional 🍋 Baseball 10 Times As Fun"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He followed this up 🍊 with countless baseball books 🍋 aimed at a general audience - 🍊 sometimes two or three a year. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were even a couple of 🍋 'Emoyan no 10-bai' movies 🍊 released on videotape. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, in 1989 🍋 this game was released. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He continued writing baseball 🍋 books uh... up until about, uh, 🍊 sometime this decade and is a 🍋 [pretty] well-known Japanese media figure, 🍊 landing such gigs as, uh, 🍋 being a judge on "Iron Chef". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a very odd game 🍋 and plays a lot differently 🍊 than most of the other 🍋 baseball games we've covered. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The batting mechanics, in particular, 🍊 will cause you 🍋 no end of grief 🍊 until you gradually become 🍋 accustomed to them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This seems to be almost 🍋 more based on strategy 🍊 rather than pure skill, 🍊 and there's even a certain 🍋 amount of automation here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 when the other team gets a hit, 🍊 your players will run 🍋 towards the ball automatically; 🍊 you don't control them directly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't really know 🍋 if this was popular in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There was a Game Boy version of 🍋 this planned at some point, 🍊 but its release was 🍋 eventually canceled. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, this isn't exactly 🍋 a recommended game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At least it's 🍋 a bit more interesting 🍊 than most [of] the 🍋 baseball games we've seen here, 🍊 just because it's so damn weird. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Famista '90 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 19 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "I Love Softball" 🍋 looks virtually avant-garde 🍊 when compared to Namco's 🍋 "Famista '90" - 🍊 the fifth game in the 🍋 'Family Stadium' series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll recall that the 🍋 first 'Family Stadium' game 🍊 was released in the West 🍋 as "R.B.I. Baseball". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, in 1990 Tengen 🍋 revived the 'R.B.I. Baseball' name 🍊 for a series of games 🍋 that continues on today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, starting with 🍋 "R.B.I. Baseball 2", 🍊 it was its own separate series - 🍊 distinct from the main 🍋 'Family Stadium' games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the past, 🍋 I've complained about how 🍋 each new 'Family Stadium' game 🍊 is exactly the same 🍋 as the one before it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nothing ever changes other than 🍋 they update the team's rosters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, at this point, 🍋 I don't know... I mean, 🍊 what... what can I possibly 🍋 say about this game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each new entry in the series 🍋 shows some incremental improvement 🍋 - very minor touches. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Tiny little bits of graphical 🍋 updates have been made. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Look at the field, here; 🍊 they've added a few things 🍋 around the base line. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But the good thing is 🍊 I'm now past the halfway point 🍋 in the 'Famista' series - 🍊 five down; 🍋 [only] four more to go. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I won't have to deal 🍋 with the 'Famista' series again 🍊 until I reach December 1990 🍋 (so about five years in real time). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After this episode, 🍊 I don't even think we have 🍋 another baseball game 🍊 until around March of 1990. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Quarter Back Scramble: American Football Game 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 19 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Natsume
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, in addition to 🍊 the three baseball games 🍋 released on December 19th, 🍊 we also have a much rarer bird: 🍋 the Japanese football game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is published by 🍋 the record label Pony Canyon 🍊 and developed by Natsume, 🍋 of all people. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the flicker effect 🍋 is [pretty] cool, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is Japan so naturally, 🍋 a girl in a bunny suit was thrown in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The music is sort of decent as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Graphically, it looks quite nice 🍋 compared to, say, "Famista '90". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The teams here are kind of weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Denver Miles'(?) and 🍋 'San Francisco '50s'? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean those sounds stupid 🍋 but sort of makes sense. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the 'L.A. Arks'? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The logo looks like 🍋 the Raiders logo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Remember, in '89 the 'Raiders' 🍋 were in L.A., not Oakland.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'D.C. Hogs' logo looks 🍋 like the 'Redskins' logo... 🍋 but 'Hogs'?. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I have no clue with 🍋 the 'Chicago Forces', 🍊 yet there is currently a 🍋 Chicago W.F.A. team 🍋 called the 'Chicago Force'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They weren't around in the '80s 🍋 so either 🍊 there's some kind of 🍋 obvious meaning to the name 🍊 that I'm not understanding or it's 🍋 just a really weird coincidence. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You know, from a 🍋 purely aesthetic standpoint, 🍊 I like "Quarter Back Scramble". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The colors, the animation... 🍋 all looks very clean and appealing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game, itself, 🍊 is certainly not going to make 🍋 anyone forget "Tecmo Bowl". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [pretty] rudimentary; 🍋 just pick a formation, 🍊 then if you're playing defense 🍋 tackle the guy - 🍊 or on offense try to make a pass. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The one guide I found online 🍊 suggested always going 🍋 with the 6-2-3 formation 🍊 when playing defense 🍋 against the computer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And when playing offense just try 🍋 to make a bunch of short passes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Quarter Back Scramble" 🍋 is [pretty] obscure; 🍊 you won't find any detailed 🍋 playthroughs on YouTube 🍊 and there are zero 🍋 reviews on GameFAQs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, it was scheduled 🍋 for a U.S. release, at one point 🍊 - under the name 🍋 "Mike Ditka's Big Play Football". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Chris Bieniek of 🍋 'VideoGames & Computer Entertainment' 🍊 posted a copy of the press release 🍋 from Accolade on his website. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Which gives a late 🍋 1990 release date 🍊 and a prototype actually 🍋 turned up a few years later. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 NESguide.com uploaded some footage 🍊 which shows that very little has 🍋 changed from the original 🍊 (other than a new title screen 🍋 and some English text). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even the team names 🍋 are still the same - 🍊 so it appears they didn't 🍋 actually have a license 🍊 to use the name 'Chicago Bears' 🍋 - just Mike Ditka's name. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know why this was canceled, 🍊 but Ditka eventually did get his 🍋 own football video game: 🍊 "Mike Ditka's Power Football" 🍊 - an unlicensed 🍋 Genesis game from 1991. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So there's nothing really wrong 🍋 with "Quarter Back Scramble". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just a very simple football game 🍊 that probably wouldn't have 🍋 made much of an impact 🍋 on the U.S. market. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not terrible 🍋 and (more importantly) 🍊 at least it's not 🍋 another Baseball or Golf Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Money Game II 🇯🇵 // Wall Street Kid 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 20 🇯🇵 // 1990 [?] [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SOFEL
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by SOFEL 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so we just have 🍊 [only] one game released each 🍋 on December 20th and 21st. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "The Money Game II" 🍋 was published by SOFEL - 🍊 a not very 🍋 interesting developer 🍊 that mostly specialized 🍋 in Simulation Games 🍊 (including, of course, 🍋 the first "Money Game" 🍋 released in August 1988). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was a visually 🍋 unpleasant-looking 🍋 text-heavy game 🍊 about trying to make money 🍋 on the stock market 🍊 (as well as get married, 🍋 have a kid, 🍊 and buy a series of 🍋 increasingly expensive cars). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Money Game II" follows this 🍋 pattern relatively closely. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You appear to be a somewhat 🍋 browbeaten salaryman 🍊 who is trying to obtain 🍋 the good life for himself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's certainly 🍋 slicker-looking than 🍋 the first "Money Game" 🍊 but the basic interface 🍋 is the same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 From your office, 🍋 you use your computer, 🍊 telephone, etc. 🍋 to buy and sell stocks - 🍊 also to speak to bankers, 🍋 advisers, and so on 🍊 as well as interacting 🍋 with your girlfriend. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The newspaper will 🍋 give you tips as to what 🍋 stocks are doing well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, previously 🍋 SOFEL had localized 🍊 a casino game called 🍋 "Million-Dollar Kid" 🍊 and released it in the U.S. 🍋 as "Casino Kid". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Following this pattern, 🍊 "The Money Game II" was 🍋 rebranded as "Wall Street Kid" 🍊 and made its way to America 🍋 in June 1990. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the basic structure 🍋 of the two games is the same, 🍊 however the graphics and plot 🍋 have been completely reworked, 🍋 from the ground up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The main character is a 🍋 preppy-ish-looking douchebag 🍊 who is about to inherit 🍋 the Benedict family fortune. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But there is a 🍋 'Brewster's Millions'-style 🍋 clause in the will. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to make enough money 🍋 to buy a house, get married, 🍊 and finally purchase the 🍋 Benedict family castle in Europe. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Only] once you have 🍋 proven yourself worthy 🍊 will you be able to inherit 🍋 the absurdly huge sum of 🍋 six hundred billion dollars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You get five hundred thousand 🍋 to get you started. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you were to sit down 🍋 and play "Wall Street Kid" 🍊 (and I can't say I'd recommend it) 🍊 you would find it extremely 🍋 repetitive - almost ritualistic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every day begins with 🍋 reading the paper 🍊 (which mentions the interest 🍋 rates, the current stock trends, 🍊 and a bit of 🍋 mostly unhelpful news - 🍊 such as a new video game 🍋 being released 🍊 or a rock concert selling out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Everything is done in this screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can call a few 🍋 people on the phone 🍊 (for example, to try to get 🍋 a loan or ask for stock tips) 🍊 but mostly you use the computer, 🍋 the flower vase, and 🍊 what the manual calls the 🍋 'barometer', for some reason. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The computer is used for 🍋 buying and selling stocks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just a list of stocks with 🍋 names similar to real-life companies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The paper tells you 🍋 what stocks are currently hot 🍊 so it's helpful to buy those. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The flower vase 🍋 contacts your girlfriend 🍊 and you can take her out to a picnic, 🍋 shopping, or to the carnival. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The barometer 🍋 allows you to exercise 🍊 - either at the gym, 🍋 the swimming pool, 🍋 or the hiking trail. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And finally, 🍋 the clock ends the day. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The thing is, there's 🍋 really not that much 🍋 to do during the day. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The stock trends cycle 🍋 on a weekly basis, 🍊 so you might [only] need to 🍋 buy or sell once a week. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Often a day will 🍋 just consist of 🍊 taking your girlfriend 🍋 out and exercising. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there are a couple ways 🍋 you can lose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, 🍊 not exercising kills you 🍋 surprisingly quickly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your girlfriend gives you a h... 🍋 few hints before this happens, 🍊 letting you know 🍋 how terrible you look. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Likewise, your girl will dump you 🍋 if you don't keep her happy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This seems to take a long time 🍊 and you could make her mad 🍋 by taking her on the wrong date, 🍊 based on the news. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍊 if the paper says that 🍋 there were crimes happening 🍋 at the shopping mall 🍊 and then you offer to take her 🍋 to the mall, she'll get mad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You also have to buy her 🍋 things to keep her happy 🍊 but, again, there are 🍋 no immediate consequences. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, apparently it takes 🍋 a [pretty] long time 🍊 of doing this 🍋 over and over again 🍊 before it bites you in the ass. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Mostly, though, you can lose 🍋 by just not having enough money. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are deadlines for buying the 🍋 house, the boat, etc. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And if you haven't 🍋 saved up enough money 🍊 by the end of the month 🍋 for the house, for example, 🍊 another buyer will snatch 🍋 it up and you'll lose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Because apparently there's 🍋 [only] one rich guy house for sale 🍊 in whatever c... city this is, 🍊 so you can't just go out 🍋 and buy some other house). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Likewise, if you agreed 🍋 to purchase the house 🍊 but you haven't saved up 🍋 enough money at that point, 🍊 the deal will fall through 🍋 and you'll also lose the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Same goes for buying 🍋 the yacht, the castle, and so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I certainly can't 🍋 recommend this to anybody. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The linearity and repetitiveness 🍋 makes it [pretty] damn boring. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean there weren't 🍋 very many Simulation Games 🍋 on consoles at this time, 🍊 so I think it may have seemed 🍋 kind of fresh back in 1989 🍊 but today you 🍋 probably shouldn't bother. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Lord of King 🇯🇵 // Astyanax 🇺🇸 ✨

✅🏮🍊🍓 December 31st and we have 🍋 just one game today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 From Jaleco it's "Lord of King". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We had previously seen 🍋 "Lord of Sword" and here, 🍊 there's another 🍋 awkwardly-titled game 🍊 that did end up getting 🍋 its name changed when 🍋 it came out in the U.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Jaleco must have had this one 🍋 pegged for the Western market, 🍊 since a mere three months later 🍋 (in March) 🍊 this was released as "Astyanax". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, so the kid's name is 🍋 'Astyanax' - 🍊 from Greek mythology, he thinks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (It's called a wet dream, kid; 🍋 you need to get laid.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as far as I can tell, 🍊 nothing was changed 🍋 for this U.S. version, 🍊 other than translating the text. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Is she wearing leg-warmers? 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 This is just so 1980s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, this fairy creature, 🍋 named 'Cutie', 🍊 says the princess 🍋 has been kidnapped 🍊 by some evil dude, 🍋 named [Blackhorn], 🍊 and you need to rescue her. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It feels like we've seen this plot 🍋 used before somewhere. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, armed with a mighty axe, you 🍋 head out to kick some monster ass. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Astyanax" is a very very 🍋 basic side-scrolling Action Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's literally just 🍋 'walk forward and kill things'; 🍊 (you also do a bit of jumping). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, the first thing 🍋 you might notice is: 🍊 the hit detection is [pretty] odd. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, this is a hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It looks like you need to jump up 🍋 a step in order to hit the skeleton, 🍊 but no; it somehow 🍋 just barely makes contact. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, this is not a hit; 🍋 but this is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just look at this; 🍋 it's ridiculous! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, be prepared for some very 🍋 unintuitive action in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I originally thought there was 🍊 no possible way I could hit those 🍋 things from this position, 🍊 so I tried jumping 🍋 and attacking them 🍊 (which would always 🍋 lead to my death). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's so odd that 🍊 you are clearly not touching 🍋 these things, yet they die. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You find various power-ups in 🍋 these little golden post things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This one's a weapons upgrade; 🍊 it increases the length 🍋 of your Power bar 🍊 and the damage that 🍋 your Magic does. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 (Here's the first mini-boss; 🍊 dude looks like he has 🍋 two horse dicks for a head.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you may have gathered, 🍋 the L.F. bar is your Life Force. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The S.P. is your 🍋 Spell Points(?), I assume. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It looks like you have a lot, 🍊 but casting a spell 🍋 uses up multiple points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (After you defeat this dude, 🍊 you then get to the real 🍋 first boss - immediately afterwards.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your Life and Magic refill 🍋 after each level (thank goodness!) 🍊 otherwise this game 🍋 would be very difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 They have these nice relatively-long 🍋 cutscenes between levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So here's the thing; 🍋 in the U.S. version, 🍊 Blackhorn's skeleton flunky 🍋 is named 'Thorndog'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's right, 'Thorndog'! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 ("Heart of stone... face of bone", 🍋 as the manual calls him). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 That aside, "Astyanax" suffers 🍋 from being a [pretty] uninspired game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's really not 🍋 much variation here; 🍊 you just see the same enemies 🍋 over and over. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Level design is [pretty] much 🍋 walking left to right 🍊 along a flat surface - 🍋 with a few jumps here and there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are a few exceptions 🍊 such as a... the, uh, 🍋 very annoying last level, 🍊 but at least the bosses 🍋 are mostly cool-looking. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I wonder why they called this 🍋 "Astyanax", though. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's such a weird random 🍋 name to attach this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The character states the name 🍋 is from Greek mythology, 🍊 which is sort of correct. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Astyanax was a minor figure 🍋 in the Trojan War - 🍊 the young son of Hector, 🍋 king of Troy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He appears in various Greek and 🍋 Roman Trojan War narratives 🍊 and is generally thought to have 🍋 been killed during the fall of Troy - 🍊 most famously by being 🍋 thrown off the city walls. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyhoo, the semi-final level 🍋 is one of those levels 🍊 like that castle from 🍋 "Super Mario Bros." 🍊 where you have to take a 🍋 specific path through the level, 🍊 otherwise you'll just keep 🍋 moving around in a loop. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are various doors 🍋 in each section 🍊 and you need to keep 🍋 entering the correct one 🍊 or get sent back 🍋 to the beginning. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's very annoying. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At the end, you face off 🍋 with Thorndog, himself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After defeating him, 🍊 he tells you that he's 🍋 created some kind of magic seal 🍊 that will kill you if you 🍋 try to leave the castle 🍊 so you're stuck there forever. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then Cutie bravely sacrifices 🍋 herself to break the seal 🍊 and we get this 🍋 dramatic powerful scene. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The final final-level (the tower) 🍊 is just a boss rush, 🍋 followed by Blackhorn, himself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's a two-part boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First, you fight him in his, 🍋 sort of, normal quasi-human form 🍊 (he's [pretty] simple; just 🍋 whack him with a sword a bit). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then you must face off 🍋 against his true form: 🍊 a *huge* multi-sprite 🍋 dragon with a jewel in his chest. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You damage him by hitting 🍋 the jewel, obviously. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 All of this sounds very 🍋 'Castlevania'-like. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And while "Astyanax" does 🍋 resemble the 'Castlevania' games, 🍊 compared to "Castlevania III..." 🍊 (which came out 🍋 literally one day later) 🍊 "Astyanax" is a barren 🍋 wasteland of a game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It lacks any sense of adventure, 🍋 exploration, or surprise. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The most notable thing about it 🍊 is the relatively heavy 🍋 cutscenes between levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The ending is [pretty] weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Astyanax" returns to Earth 🍋 and back to his normal life, 🍊 when he encounters Cutie 🍊 who is now no longer a fairy 🍋 but a normal-sized human. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And yet they don't recognize 🍋 each other at first 🍊 and walk right past each other, 🍋 which is... strange. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then the princess 🍋 appears and says, 🍊 'Hey! Cutie returning to life is 🍋 a reward for your bravery!', 🍊 which is also a little odd. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In conclusion, "Astyanax" 🍊 is not nearly as good as 🍋 I was hoping it would be. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's merely a game 🍋 with good production values 🍊 but little inspiration. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Double Dragon II: The Revenge 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 22 🇯🇵 // 1990 01 [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Technos Japan
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Technos Japan 🇯🇵 // Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here we have another 🍋 massively successful sequel: 🍊 "Double Dragon II: The Revenge" 🍋 from good old Technos Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Another game that demonstrates 🍋 how publishers' strategies 🍊 were changing in the 🍋 late '80s/early '90s. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, this was released 🍋 in the U.S. almost immediately. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo's official games 🍋 list states January 1990 🍊 (apparently around the same time as 🍋 "River City Ransom"'s U.S. release). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "River City..." was, I believe, 🍋 the first Technos game to be 🍊 published by Technos 🍋 themselves in the U.S. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Previously, a few Technos titles 🍋 (such as the first "Double Dragon") 🍊 were put out by Tradewest 🍋 in the United States. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 With "Double Dragon II", however, 🍋 Technos went with Acclaim 🍊 (who also handled the North American 🍋 release for "Double Dragon III"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Regardless, this once again 🍋 shows the rising importance of 🍊 the English-speaking market 🍋 for Japanese game companies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So we have the heroes 🍋 from the first game 🍊 (brothers Billy and Jimmy) 🍊 despite the fact that 🍋 in the first "Double Dragon" 🍊 Jimmy turned out to be the 🍋 leader of the "Shadow Warriors" 🍊 and was killed by Billy 🍋 at the end of the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Double Dragon II" 🍋 engages in a bit of retcon 🍊 since, in the 2-Player version, 🍋 Billy and Jimmy are both still alive 🍊 and out to get revenge for the 🍋 slaying of Billy's girlfriend. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, unlike the N.E.S. 🍋 version of the first game, 🍊 this has a true 2-Player version 🍊 where Jimmy and Billy are 🍋 on the screen together - 🍊 just like in the Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for this video, 🍋 I'll be using the Japanese game 🍊 since the U.S. version 🍋 was made a bit tougher 🍊 by giving you three 🍋 difficulty levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (You know, 🍋 just like the Japanese version, 🍊 except the lower two difficulty 🍋 modes aren't the entire game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have to choose the 🍋 Supreme Master difficulty level 🍊 to get all the way to the end. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the Japanese version 🍋 has infinite continues 🍊 and the U.S. version does not. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, honestly, I've never 🍋 played this game until now. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [pretty] hard and there's no way 🍋 I'd get very far with the U.S. version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Double Dragon II" originally 🍋 hit arcades in 1988 🍊 and it feels very similar 🍋 to the original title, 🍊 with no major changes 🍋 to the gameplay - 🍊 just slightly improved graphics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing about the FamiCom 🍋 "Double Dragon II": 🍊 it's an example of the growing 🍋 trend of what I'll call 🍊 'Ninja Gaid...'-ification 🍋 of N.E.S. games 🍊 (where arcade ports 🍋 are significantly altered to 🍋 make them more 'consoley'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, a number of 🍋 levels have been changed 🍊 and some platforming 🍋 elements have been added 🍊 (much to the game's 🍋 detriment, in my opinion). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Genesis port 🍋 (as we'll eventually see) 🍊 sticks [pretty] closely to 🍋 the original Arcade game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there are a few things 🍋 in "Double Dragon II" 🍊 that you might have 🍋 trouble getting used to 🍊 if you played the 🍋 first one on the N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The controls have been reworked 🍋 to resemble the arcade version's - 🍊 so rather than one button 🍋 being used to kick 🍊 and the other to punch, 🍊 both buttons are now used 🍋 for punches and kicks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The A button will punch to the 🍋 right if you are facing right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The B button will punch to the 🍋 left if you are facing left. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So if there are enemies 🍋 on both sides of you 🍊 and you are facing 🍋 the enemy on your right 🍊 you would press A 🍊 and then to punch 🍋 the enemy behind you 🍊 turn around and press B. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, to kick you 🍋 press the other button 🍊 (the one that doesn't 🍋 throw a punch) 🍊 meaning that 🍋 if you face right 🍊 and hit the B button 🍋 you will kick. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the kicks are always back-kicks; 🍋 you never kick a guy in front of you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In other words, 🍊 the control scheme flips itself 🍋 every time you change directions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's very unusual and definitely 🍋 takes some getting used to, 🍊 so playing this for the first time 🍋 will kind of send your head spinning. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You also have a few additional moves 🍋 that are automatically triggered 🍊 when you hit an enemy 🍋 and then get in close 🍊 (like the knee to the face 🍋 or the over-the-shoulder throw). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another major bummer in 🍋 "Double Dragon II" is the jump. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Since both of the N.E.S. buttons 🍋 are used in attacking, 🍊 jumping is done by pressing 🍋 A and B together 🍊 (which is a bit awkward). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, this would be okay 🍋 if jumping were used minimally, 🍊 but for some reason, 🍋 Technos decided to add in 🍊 several short unnecessary 🍋 platforming sections. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A couple of these involved 🍋 conveyor-belt-style platforms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this would be fine 🍋 in "Megaman" or something, 🍊 but here it just feels like a way 🍋 to produce frustration in the player 🍊 (and maybe even squeeze 🍋 in a few cheap deaths). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Jumping is also used in performing 🍋 the most powerful attacks, 🍊 such as the hurricane kick, the, 🍋 uh, uppercut, and the knee attack 🍊 (that inexplicably throws enemies 🍋 all the way across the screen). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These are extremely useful 🍋 but a bit tricky to pull off. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Double Dragon II" sold 🍋 a ton of carts in the U.S., 🍊 so it must have 🍋 done something right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the odd control scheme 🍋 is definitely a bit off-putting 🍊 to newbies like me; 🍊 this would be so much better if [only] 🍋 the N.E.S. had another button. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As it stands, 🍊 I liked it quite a bit less 🍋 than I did "River City Ransom". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Akumajou Densetsu 🇯🇵 // Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 22 🇯🇵 // 1990 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here we are, folks, 🍋 the big one: "Castlevania III..." - 🍊 the marathon (not your average 🍋 50-yard dash of FamiCom). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For you people, nowadays, 🍋 who are into old games, 🍊 I suspect a lot of you would put 🍋 "Castlevania III..." 🍊 up there with the absolute 🍋 top tier of N.E.S. games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Up there with "Megaman 2" and 🍋 "Super Mario ... 3" and so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, uh, 🍊 I.G.N. a couple years ago 🍋 did a list of Best N.E.S. Games 🍊 and put it at number five. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And while it is a 🍋 beautifully-made game, 🍊 it could also be 🍋 brutally hard at times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the series eventually 🍋 backed away from this approach 🍊 with the very popular 🍋 "Symphony of the Night" 🍊 and the so-called 🍋 'Igavania' games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, as you know, 🍋 "Castlevania III..." 🍊 is titled "Akumajou Densetsu" 🍋 (or 'Demon Castle Legend'), 🍋 in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The word 'Densetsu', 🍋 when used in game titles, 🍊 tends to connote a 🍋 more Adventure Game feel 🍊 rather than straight-up Action 🍋 (as in "Zelda no Densetsu...") 🍊 and is often used in R.P.G.s 🍊 or other games that tend towards 🍋 the, uh, the nonlinear side. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, "Castlevania III..." 🍋 offers more player choice. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are branching paths and 🍋 multiple playable characters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the U.S. version was 🍋 released in September 1990 🍊 (a [pretty] long wait 🍋 compared to "Double Dragon II") 🍊 but there were some changes and 🍋 additions made in the U.S. version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The most obvious thing we'll notice 🍋 is that the music is different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Konami used a custom chip: the VRC6 🍋 (or 'Virtual ROM Controller 6'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This allowed for additional 🍋 three sound channels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Since it was incompatible 🍋 with the American N.E.S., 🍊 Konami had to rejigger the music 🍋 to use Nintendo's MMC5 chip instead 🍊 (losing some sound channels 🍋 [in] the process). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's a comparison. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, today we'll be playing a 🍋 translation of the Japanese version 🍊 so we can listen to 🍋 the dope-ass soundtrack 🍊 while still being able 🍋 to read the dialogue 🍊 and appreciate the 🍋 deep characterization. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The plot here gives some 🍋 background on Dracula. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After causing a bunch of 🍋 hullabaloo in Transylvania, 🍊 the church asked the 'Belmond' 🍋 family to take him out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The hero, here, is Trevor Belmont 🍋 (or 'Ralph' in the Japanese version). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Trevor is the forefather 🍋 of Simon Belmont 🍊 and is the, uh, origin of the 🍋 "Belmont Warlord Chromosomes", 🍊 according to the manual. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Castlevania" lore, 🍋 this takes place in 1476 - 🍊 right around the time that the 🍋 real-life Vlad Tepes died. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And "Castlevania" 1 🍋 takes place in 1691 🍊 (though, according to 🍋 the game itself, 🍊 "Castlevania III..." happens 🍋 100 years before the first one). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Dracula is also identified 🍋 as Vlad Tepes in this game, 🍊 though later he 🍋 got retconned into 🍊 a non-famous dude 🍋 named Mathias Cronqvist. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Castlevania III..." combines the 🍋 mechanics of the first "Castlevania" 🍊 with something resembling 🍋 the world of "Simon's Quest". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You begin in the destroyed village 🍋 and travel through forests, swamps, 🍊 and so on before reaching Dracula's 🍋 castle near the end of the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You also reach a fork in the road 🍊 and are confronted with a choice 🍋 of which direction to go. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The upper path will take you through 🍋 a, uh, familiar clock-tower-like setting, 🍊 complete with giant swinging 🍋 gears, spikes, and Medusa heads. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (I'm not really sure why spikes 🍋 are necessary in a clock tower). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At the top, 🍋 you'll find Grant Danasty - 🍊 your first spirit companion. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you defeat him, 🍊 he'll offer to join you in 🍋 your quest to destroy Dracula. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You can switch back and forth 🍋 between Trevor and your spirit 🍋 companion at will, 🍊 and each spirit has different 🍋 strengths and weaknesses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Grant can throw daggers 🍋 (at least in the Japanese version) 🍊 and climb on walls, thus 🍋 allowing you to take shortcuts 🍊 and sometimes bypass 🍋 certain tricky sections. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you took 🍋 the lower path earlier 🍊 you will skip the 🍋 clock tower and Grant, 🍊 and your path will then 🍋 converge with the upper path. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A little bit further down the road 🍋 and you'll come to the game's main fork. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These two paths lead you on two 🍋 entirely different sets of levels, 🍊 (though one boss fight 🍋 does appear in both paths). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They don't meet up until 🍋 the final level: Dracula's lair - 🍊 so Konami has basically 🍋 given us two games in one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Super Mario ... 3" offered 🍋 a similar sort of non-linearity, 🍊 though in "Castlevania III..." 🍋 you'd technically have to 🍊 play the game three times 🍋 to see all the content. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are six total possible 🍋 routes to take in the game 🍊 and there are four 🍋 different endings. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The upper path 🍋 (which we are seeing here) 🍊 is considered the 🍋 'easy' path, so to speak. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll quickly encounter 🍋 a cyclops boss, 🍊 who defeating will release... 🍋 Sypha(?) Seepha(?) 🍊 who just happens to 🍋 be a vampire hunter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 She's sort of the weak-physical/🍋 strong-magic character 🍊 and her magic attacks 🍋 can be quite useful. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can [only] have 🍋 one spirit buddy at a time, 🍊 so you'll need to 🍋 say goodbye to Grant 🍊 if you want Sypha 🍋 to join your party. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, while Sypha is female, 🍊 whoever was responsible for the U.S. 🍋 manual must not have gotten the memo 🍊 because Sypha is 🍋 referred to as 'he' 🍊 (though the illustration 🍋 used is [pretty] ambiguous). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's possible this 🍋 was intended to be a 🍊 "Metroid"-style switcheroo 🍊 since at the end of the game 🍋 she takes off her hood 🍊 and then her long 🍋 hair falls down. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So you make your way 🍋 through Dracula's castle 🍊 fighting the standard 🍋 'Castlevania' enemies 🍊 and encountering Frankenstein 🍋 (previously seen in 🍋 the first "Castlevania"), 🍊 and a water dragon, 🍋 and finally a three-part boss 🍊 fight with mummies, 🍋 the cyclops again, 🍋 and a giant demon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, the cyclops and demon 🍋 behave in very predictable patterns 🍊 so you can easily defeat them 🍋 if you're careful 🍊 and don't take any silly risks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Finally, your path will 🍋 take you to "Castlevania" 1's 🍊 main hall and the original 🍋 music theme starts playing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay great, but what if 🍋 you took the lower path, 🍋 back at the main fork? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you'd find yourself along 🍋 the harder underground path 🍋 to Dracula's Tower. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, in my opinion, 🍊 the underground levels are 🍋 actually a bit of a bitch. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though they do introduce 🍋 a lot of new stuff to the series 🍊 (like these little traps that 🍋 ensnare you between enemies, 🍊 acid that drips down from the 🍋 ceiling and dissolves the ground - 🍊 this is employed in 🍋 several puzzle-like rooms, 🍊 lots of blocks that crumble 🍋 when you step on them, and so on). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, instead of Sypha, 🍊 you'll encounter Alucard 🍋 on the lower path. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Defeating him and he'll introduce 🍋 himself D... as Dracula's son 🍊 and says that he hates his dad 🍋 and wants to kill him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, later Alucard became 🍋 a [pretty] well-loved character 🍊 in the "Castlevania" series. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The name Alucard, of course, 🍋 comes from Universal's 🍋 1943 movie "Son of Dracula". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, in this movie, 🍋 the mysterious Count Alucard 🍊 (played by Lon Chaney Jr.) 🍊 turns out to be 🍋 Dracula himself at the end. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Incidentally, Chaney 🍊 could not repeat the role 🍋 for the next movie Dracula 🍊 appeared in, 🍋 "House of Frankenstein", 🍊 because that movie also 🍋 featured The Werewolf 🍊 and Chaney had to 🍋 play that role instead. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, of course, 🍋 everybody likes Alucard 🍊 but he's a little bit lame as a 🍋 playable character in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He shoots fireballs which have 🍋 good range but are very weak. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He doesn't have any special attacks 🍋 except that he can use the stopwatch. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And he can turn 🍋 into a bat and fly - 🍊 which might help you out in 🍋 certain areas with tricky jumps. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But changing into a bat 🍊 uses up hearts at the rate 🍋 of about one per second 🍊 and getting hit will cause you 🍋 to transform back into human form. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So this is something that you 🍋 really can't exploit too much. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I said earlier, 🍋 just like "Super Mario ... 3" 🍊 or "Megaman 2" and "... 3", 🍊 "Castlevania III..." 🍋 is almost, like, 🍊 the perfect example of 🍋 a sequel on the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's longer (about twice 🍋 the length of the first one), 🍊 it doesn't dramatically change 🍋 the gameplay-style or mechanics, 🍊 but instead adds in new elements 🍊 (for example, the spirit companions 🍋 and their new abilities), 🍊 it offers up new 🍋 monsters and environments, 🍊 yet still has various 🍋 callbacks to the first game 🍊 (such as the clock tower, 🍋 the stairs leading up 🍋 to Dracula, and so on). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's an excellent balance 🍋 of familiar and new elements. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The graphics are more detailed; 🍊 that special sound chip was used 🍋 to improve the, uh, the music. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Castlevania III..." just feels like 🍋 a lot of time and money went into it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are more bosses here 🍋 than in the first game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Frankenstein, mummies, 🍋 Death all return - 🍊 as well as 🍋 a lot of new stuff. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And in the underground path, 🍊 there's a rather 🍋 creative boss fight: 🍊 the bone dragon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After you have done 🍋 some damage to him, 🍊 he escapes, causing the 🍋 chamber to begin flooding. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A bit later, after you 🍋 escape the floodwaters, 🍊 he will suddenly reappear and 🍋 you'll need to finish him off. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing about this game - 🍊 as we know, it can be 🍋 horrendously hard at times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Konami did not make Trevor Belmont 🍋 any faster or more agile. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can still [only] 🍋 whip straight ahead. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can still fall off 🍋 stairs to your death. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can't run, and you still jump 🍋 in the same slow unchangeable arc. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you hit the jump button 🍋 you are committed 🍊 (can't speed up or 🍋 slow down or turn around). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And getting hit while 🍋 in the middle of a jump 🍊 (say, from one 🍋 ledge to another) 🍊 will frequently cause you 🍋 to fall to your death. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The underground path, 🍋 in particular, 🍊 is just stuffed with 🍋 brutally hard moments. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game loves to 🍋 throw you in a situation 🍊 where you have 🍋 enemies attacking you 🍊 from the front and from 🍋 behind at the same time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Levels, where the blocks 🍋 crumble as you stand on them, 🍊 will constantly 🍋 push you forward. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's really no time 🍋 to plan or strategize; 🍊 you just have to keep jumping. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Time levels also punish you 🍋 severely for making mistakes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Missing a jump and landing 🍋 on a lower platform 🍊 can mean unavoidable death. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The falling block room 🍋 is one of the toughest, 🍊 simply because it's so long. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Blocks fall from above, 🍊 allowing you to slowly reach 🍋 the top of the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's quite easy to 🍋 accidentally take a few 🍋 blocks to the head and die. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The lower path 🍋 (just like the upper one) 🍊 will eventually take you 🍋 to Dracula's Tower, 🍊 skipping the rest of 🍋 the castle completely. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Essentially you have 🍋 traveled below the castle 🍊 instead of going through it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So both paths merge again 🍋 at Dracula's Tower 🍊 (which sort of resembles, uh, 🍋 "Castlevania" 1 in miniature). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are three bosses 🍋 in this level, 🍊 starting off with our 🍋 old buddy the Grim Reaper 🍊 (probably the hardest 🍋 boss in the game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He sends out these 🍋 damn sickles everywhere. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sypha's lightning magic is 🍋 [pretty] powerful against him, 🍊 but her ice magic is useless. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So if you got stuck with 🍋 the ice or holy water, 🍊 this is gonna be an 🍋 extremely tough fight. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 His second form is 🍋 this giant fanged-skull 🍊 (who thankfully [only] throws 🍋 one sickle at you at a time). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, a little bit later, 🍋 you must battle... yourself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, you're not too tough, 🍊 though if you change to a spirit 🍋 companion form so will the boss, 🍊 but there is a little bit of delay 🍋 that you can take advantage of. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After some tricky jumping 🍋 in the clock tower, 🍊 you climb up those familiar stairs 🍋 to meet the man himself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One interesting thing is 🍋 that none of the bosses 🍊 (even Dracula himself) 🍋 utter a single word in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Quite a bit of a difference 🍊 from the windbag Dracula 🍋 in "Symphony of the Night"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy doesn't 🍋 want to debate you; 🍊 he just wants to kill you 🍋 - no questions asked. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ok so final boss Dracula 🍋 has three forms: 🍊 classic Drac, 🍋 weird gooey slime monster Drac, 🍋 and giant demon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 His third form appears 🍋 [to] be based on Pazuzu 🍊 (the Mesopotamian wind demon) 🍊 and it's possibly inspired by 🍋 the depiction of Pazuzu 🍊 in the "Dungeons & Dragons 🍋 Monster Manual" 🍊 (which I assume is also 🍋 how Pazuzu ended up in 🍊 'Dragon Quest' and the 🍋 'Final Fantasy' games). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned earlier, 🍊 Konami ramped up 🍋 the difficulty 🍊 quite a bit for 🍋 the U.S. version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So Dracula is a lot easier 🍋 in the Japanese game; 🍊 he shoots fewer projectiles 🍋 at you during his final form 🍊 and if you die you restart 🍋 right outside the stairs 🍋 leading up to his chamber. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Instead, the game actually 🍋 sends you back a couple rooms. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are four different endings: 🍊 one for each of the 🍋 different companions 🍊 that you can 🍋 finish the game with - 🍊 and a fourth if you finish the 🍋 game without having a companion 🍊 (since you don't actually have to 🍋 accept any of the companions; 🍊 you could just turn them down 🍋 when they ask to join you). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As far as we can tell, 🍊 the main creative force behind 🍋 the N.E.S. "Castlevania" games 🍊 was one Hitoshi Akamatsu. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sources state that 🍋 game design decisions 🍊 were typically made 🍋 in team meetings 🍊 but Akamatsu was apparently 🍋 the lead programmer 🍊 and more or less 🍋 in charge of the project. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He was responsible for a lot 🍋 of the creative decisions 🍊 in these games and is 🍋 often thought of as 🍊 the creator of "Castlevania". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As good as "Castlevania III..." was, 🍊 it apparently sold 🍋 [pretty] poorly in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Famitsu gave it a 30 out of 40 🍊 (uh, the same score they gave, 🍋 uh, "Famista '90" - 🍋 if you can believe that). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Akamatsu was apparently demoted, 🍋 due to the game's low sales, 🍋 and left Konami. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then he [pretty] much 🍋 disappeared, I think; 🍊 no one has been able 🍋 to track him down. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, the 🍋 post-Akamatsu 'Castlevania's 🍊 all play very differently 🍋 than the first three. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it's kind of a 🍋 bittersweet note 🍊 to end the, uh, 'Castlevania' 🍋 series, on the N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But at least later we'll 🍋 come across "Rondo of Blood". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 TM Network Live in Power Bowl 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 22 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?]
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by CBS Sony 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ooh boy! 🍊 There's a bunch of kind of 🍋 lame games this episode 🍊 and I regret to inform you 🍋 that we have another one, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "TM Network Live in Power Bowl". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even, though that word salad 🍋 doesn't really mean much to you, 🍊 it presumably [brought] 🍋 a bit of doki-doki 🍊 to the hearts of 🍋 Japanese teeny boppers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You see 'TM Network' sounds like 🍋 some kind of cable TV channel 🍊 but it is actually 🍋 the name of a 🍊 Japanese pop band 🍋 from the 1980s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'TM' is reportedly 🍋 short for 'Time Machine', 🍊 which is very appropriate, 🍊 since this game has sort of 🍋 a 'Terminator'-style plot 🍊 about traveling back in time 🍋 to prevent the end of the world. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the game starts off 🍋 in the future (1999) 🍊 when a satellite malfunctions and 🍋 blows up the Earth or something. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You somehow end up going 🍋 back in time to December 1989 🍊 (yes the... exactly when this 🍋 game came out - December 1989) 🍊 in order to save the world. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, you know, this 🍋 sounds okay so far, 🍊 but did I mention this is a 🍋 menu-based Adventure Game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, another one of those. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, who were 🍋 'TM Network' exactly? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, they were a trio of 🍋 hairsprayed young men 🍊 who churned out a bunch 🍋 of singles and albums 🍊 from the mid-'80s 🍋 to early '90s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They look kinda like they 🍋 might be the Japanese Duran Duran 🍊 but their music is maybe even a 🍋 little bit less adventurous 🍊 and runs from 🍋 drum-machine-based 🍋 dance-pop 🍊 to the blandest 🍋 middle-of-the-road 🍋 pop imaginable. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One song they are remembered 🍋 for is 1987's 'Get Wild', 🍊 which was used in the 🍋 'City Hunter' anime. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe you're familiar with 🍊 the bizarre live adaptation 🍋 of 'City Hunter'... 🍊 um, the one with Jackie Chan 🍋 from the 1990s 🍊 where he gets, uh, zapped by 🍋 a "Street Fighter" cabinet 🍊 and turns into various 🍋 characters from "Street Fighter". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So anyway, it's a run-of-the-mill 🍋 Japanese Adventure Game - 🍊 one made maybe a bit less 🍋 interesting than most, 🍊 simply because so much 🍋 of the game consists of 🍊 talking to the 🍋 members of TM Network. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's interesting that, 🍋 despite being published by, 🍊 you know, Epic/Sony and 🍋 starring a music group, 🍊 the actual in-game music is 🍋 [pretty] forgettable and repetitive. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you might remember that 🍊 Sony released another game, 🍋 based on a Japanese music group, 🍊 uh, "Seikima II" way back in 1986 🍊 ([only] three years earlier, but 🍋 that's like a million years 🍋 in 'Chrontendo' time). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sony would continue to release 🍋 some FamiCom games in the early '90s 🍊 (often movie tie-ins such as 🍋 "Hudson Hawk" and "Cliffhanger"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then... I don't know; 🍋 I guess Sony got out of the 🍋 video game business or something. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Based on the stuff 🍋 we've been seeing here, 🍊 video games just 🍋 isn't Sony's forte. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So anyway, after this 🍊 there's one last game 🍋 and then we'll wrap it up. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mappy Kids 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 22 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Arc System Works
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our 15th and final 🍋 game today: "Mappy Kids" 🍊 - the third and last game 🍋 in the 'Mappy' saga. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's another game with 🍋 no music on the title screen, 🍊 which is typically a bad sign. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Though, considering how 🍋 tiresome "Mappy Kids"' music is, 🍊 I'm okay with it, 🍋 in this case. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are both [one]... 🍋 a 1-Player and a 2-Player mode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [2]-Player uses a 🍋 horizontal split-screen 🍊 but it is actually a 🍋 little bit shorter 🍊 than the 1-Player version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, booting up, we see that 🍋 "Mappy Kids" looks kinda 🍋 like "Super Mario Bros. 3" 🍊 which came out around 🍋 14 months before this, 🍊 so this could be 🍋 completely intentional. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, unlike 🍋 "Super Mario ... 3" 🍋 or "Castlevania III..." 🍊 or other games that have 🍋 a map screen like this, 🍊 "Mappy Kids" is 🍋 completely linear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The map screen doesn't 🍋 serve any function 🍊 other than allow you 🍋 to chart your progress 🍊 through the game 🍋 and get a big hint 🍊 as to what the next 🍋 level will look like. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As a little refresher 🍋 on the 'Mappy' series, 🍊 our little police mouse first 🍋 appeared in arcades in 1983. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We covered the 🍋 FamiCom adaptation. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Appropriately enough it was a 🍋 vertically-structured platformer, 🍊 much like the 🍋 original 'Mario Bros.', 🍊 with an added twist of 🍋 moving from level to level 🍊 using little trampolines. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Mappy-Land" was a 🍋 console-[only] sequel in 1986, 🍊 in which you travel to 🍋 various environments 🍊 trying to win the hand 🍋 of your girlfriend. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's an odd little game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It still uses trampolines 🍋 in most places 🍊 but also uses 🍋 horizontal level design 🍊 and feels almost like a 🍊 'Super Mario Bros.'🍋 -style platformer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was developed by Tose and 🍋 got a U.S. release by Taxan. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Mappy Kids", 🍊 the police theme has been 🍋 completely disposed of 🍊 and you're playing as 🍋 Mappy's son, Happy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Happy is a bit more 🍋 bourgeois than his father 🍊 and spends the game, 🍋 not fighting crime 🍊 but instead including wealth 🍊 so he can buy a fancy 🍋 house for his wife. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You get money, both by 🍋 collecting those ¥en symbols 🍊 and by kicking open 🍋 the little chests 🍊 and grabbing jewels 🍋 and rings and such. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The jump and the kick 🍋 are your [only] moves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can also kill enemies 🍋 by kicking them 🍊 and you can smash 🍋 certain blocks 🍊 that might be 🍋 obstructing your path. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Again, this will remind 🍋 you a lot of the 🍊 'Super Mario Bros.' 🍋 games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Though the game that 🍋 mostly comes to mind 🍊 when playing "Mappy Kids" is 🍋 "Chip 'n' Dale's Rescue Rangers" 🍊 which would come out 🍋 about six months later. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, unlike 🍋 "...Rescue Rangers", 🍊 "Mappy Kids" is not really 🍋 considered a classic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Sadly, this was the last 🍋 game in the 'Mappy' series - 🍊 on consoles at least; 🍊 years later, Namco put out 🍋 some cell phone games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But "Mappy Kids" was definitely 🍋 the most ambitious game 🍊 in the 'Mappy' series. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So there isn't that 🍋 much text in this, 🍊 but some of the minigames 🍊 do require you to 🍋 understand what's being said, 🍊 so we will look at this 🍋 unofficial translation. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We learn that Mappy just 🍋 picked out a wife for his son. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh and, by the way, Happy, 🍊 can you also build 🍋 a house for her? 🍊 Thanks! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you think your 🍋 parents are controlling; 🍊 imagine your dad 🍋 not [only] doing this 🍊 but then letting you know 🍋 by mailing you a letter. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, earlier I 🍋 mentioned the minigames. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Between levels, 🍋 you have a slot machine 🍊 and then you play one of 🍋 the three types of minigames. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The slot machine, uh, 🍊 again something taken right 🍋 out of "Super Mario Bros. 3" 🍊 will either give you money, 🍋 a special prize, or 🍊 (if you get the skull) 🍋 you will lose a bunch of money. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You will then take another 🍋 turn on the slot machine to... 🍊 to pick your opponent 🍋 in the minigame. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there's three 🍋 types of minigames: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The flag game has you 🍋 following instructions 🍊 to lower or raise, 🍋 uh, semaphore flags. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike Western semaphore, 🍋 in Japan, the flags are 🍋 solid red and white. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You're given instructions to 🍋 either hold the flag up or down, 🍊 but at the same time 🍋 you are also told 🍊 whether or not to 🍋 obey the instructions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So 'white-flag-down' 🍋 + 'don't-do-this' means, 🍊 'Put the flag in 🍋 the raised position'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's quite odd and 🍋 might take a minute 🍊 to understand what 🍋 you're supposed to do, 🍊 but once you figure it out 🍋 it's very simple. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The other games we have here: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There is sort of a 🍋 sumo wrestling match 🍊 where you attempt to push 🍋 each other out of the ring, 🍋 using your butt. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's mostly a 🍋 button-mashing game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Note the other Namco 🍋 characters in the audience. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the third minigame 🍋 is one of those 🍊 'spot-the-difference'🍋 -type puzzles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We need to look at 🍋 two similar images 🍊 and pick out something that 🍋 differs in the second one 🍊 before the timer runs out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, depending on 🍋 how well you did, 🍊 you will either 🍋 win or lose money. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Which you can then 🍋 spend in the shop 🍊 to buy parts for your house 🍊 (uh, windows, fences, 🍋 ...that kind of thing). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The ultimate goal is to 🍋 have the house fully built 🍊 when you complete 🍋 the last level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The levels are 🍋 [pretty] simply designed, 🍊 though not necessarily easy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike the 'Mario' games, 🍊 it's not always clear how 🍋 you interact with things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sometimes objects look like 🍋 they can be jumped on, 🍊 but turn out to be 🍋 merely background objects. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And some platforms can be 🍋 jumped through from below, 🍊 while others can't. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's not always 🍋 possible to know for sure 🍊 until you try jumping 🍋 and see whether or not 🍋 you hit your head. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a few items 🍋 to find in the chests; 🍊 rollerskates make 🍋 you go faster 🍊 and there is a rare 🍋 temporary-invincibility item. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But there's really nothing in 🍋 terms of secrets to look for; 🍊 there's no hidden areas, 🍋 warps, [or] secret power-ups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's strictly 🍊 'walk forward, 🍋 avoid the enemies, 🍋 and open the chests'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was developed by 🍋 the company now known 🍋 as Arc System Works. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Back in 1989, they were 🍋 called just 'Arc', I believe, 🍊 and worked on a few FamiCom 🍋 and Mega Drive games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later, of course, 🍊 they became known for the 🍋 'Guilty Gear' series 🍊 and other Fighting Games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There is really nothing 🍋 special about "Mappy Kids"; 🍊 it's a nice-looking 🍋 simple platformer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You probably won't 🍋 feel motivated to play 🍊 all the way through 🍋 to the end, though. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 53 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Wow! 🍋 What a motley collection of games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And what should I pick for 🍋 the Best Game this episode? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You know, I was originally 🍋 just gonna go with, uh, 🍊 "Castlevania III...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean everybody 🍋 loves that game, right? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But I also have to be objective 🍊 and I'll defer to Famitsu's 🍋 infallible judgment 🍊 and declare it to be a tie 🍊 between "Castlevania III..." 🍋 and "Famista '90". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's impossible to say which 🍋 of these games are better; 🍊 they are both a, uh, 🍋 solid 75 out of a hundred. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As for the Worst Game honors, 🍊 I was tempted to say 🍋 "The Uncanny X-Men" 🍊 but, you know, people have been 🍋 trashing that game for so long. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm gonna go with "Ironsword..." 🍊 which is mostly 🍋 mocked for its box art 🍊 rather than the game itself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean "...X-Men" 🍋 is mostly boring 🍊 whereas "Ironsword..." 🍋 is actively terrible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's both tedious and 🍋 incredibly irritating; 🍊 it almost seems bad on purpose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I really don't understand 🍋 any of the decisions 🍊 the developers made when 🍋 designing this thing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next Time: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Wow! There's like four 🍋 Japanese games left from 1989, 🍊 including a classic 🍋 from Sunsoft - 🍊 a game a lot of you 🍋 loved as a kid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We're also gonna wrap up 🍋 a few U.S. games from December 🍊 and then the first batch 🍋 of games from 1990. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But before then we'll have 🍋 a new 'Chronturbo' episode 🍊 and a new 'Video Nasties'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So stay tuned. 🍇🍌
