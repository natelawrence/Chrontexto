👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 23 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hello, and welcome to "Chrontendo Episode 23". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is an interesting episode, to say the least. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well you all know how much Japanese gamers love R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, like, nowadays, every other game that comes out in Japan is an R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But we haven't really seen too many genuine bona fide R.P.G.s for the FamiCom until now (a few - "Dragon Quest", "Deep Dungeon", "Megami Tensei" and a few others). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All of that changes today since October 1987 is apparently when all those R.P.G.s in development for the last year finally hit the shelves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Out of this episode's 15 games, seven are full fledged R.P.G.s, five of them are straight up "Dragon Quest" clones, the other is a part of a classic U.S. Computer R.P.G., and the last one is a port of an old Japanese Computer Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, of these seven games, one of them (by Hudson) is actually a [pretty] high-quality title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another, from Hot-B, is considered to be one of the worst R.P.G.s ever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes, and we've also got a couple bonus features, including a look at one of the great developers of the '80s and '90s, Irem. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, let's get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Millipede 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 01 🇯🇵 // 1988 October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atari | HAL 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL 🇯🇵 // HAL America 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, this music sounds familiar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's because HAL also used it in their port of "Defender II", last episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After all, with quickie ports like these, why bother coming up with new music for each one? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Millipede" is number two in a series of three old Arcade Games how released in late 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You've probably seen this game at some point in your life. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object: kill insects before they kill you - namely spiders, fleas, caterpillars, and so on (not to mention the so-called 'Millipede' itself). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Atari's original 1982 Arcade Game was a minor classic, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was a sequel to the very popular "Centipede" from 1980. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was actually very similar to "Centipede". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These games were distinguished by the trackball controller. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, both "Centipede" and "Millipede" had been ported to many home systems. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, in 1987, his games were hot, exactly hot commodities. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like the "Defender II", the U.S. version has slightly altered graphics ([I'm] not really sure why). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On a side note, if you're wondering what 'DDT' is, that is a now mostly-banned pesticide, very good at killing bugs, but very bad for other animals. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 🇯🇵 // Kid Niki: Radical Ninja 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Free Radicals (Live)" ♪ by The Flaming Lips
🎧🏮🍊♪ "...think you're radical" ♪
🎧🏮🍊♪ "But you're not so radical" ♪
🎧🏮🍊♪ "In fact, you're fanatical..." ♪


👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 02 🇯🇵 // 1987 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Irem 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 // Data East 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we are still in rather familiar territory here with another old-school N.E.S. favorite from Irem. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Japan, this game is known as "ketsu young chamoru" (which means something like 'inspiring heroes And tomorrow'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's a rather cruel way to send a message. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "I can't see you on tomorrow" is a [pretty] straightforward Action Platformer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Basically, just run forward and slice up everyone in your way.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was originally an Arcade Game from 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can see the original Arcade attract screen with a little bit longer than on the home versions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a decent looking game, but I suppose really nothing that special and doesn't seem doing very well remembered nowadays. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, on the other hand, the N.E.S. release is a completely different story. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Released not by Irem but by Data East "Kid Niki: Radical Ninja" was reasonably successful (despite the fact that it wasn't particularly good). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, you know, I guess in the early days of the N.E.S., you had to [pretty] much take what you could get. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose that Data East knew its audience and market it accordingly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 According to the manual, Niki is not [only] a 'Radical Ninja', but is also 'punk'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Though, what are 'punk' means in the context of pre-modern Japan is not really clear.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite being 'radical' and 'punk', everyone hates Niki. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Even the animals want to kill him.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Niki fights his way through seven levels in order to rescue his girlfriend. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Are ninjas even really allowed to have girlfriends?). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is gonna be one of the ugliest looking bosses in videogame history, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not much has really been changed the U.S. version, but Niki's hair has been slightly altered (his top not replaced with that most radical mid-'80s hairstyles, the rat tail). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while I suppose this game is somewhat playable "Kid Niki" does suffer through some typical low grade video game design issues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namely rather unpleasant platforming sequences, and weird boss battles, in which your weapon gets knocked at your hand every time you hit the boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then there's other irritations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... For example, enemies often move much faster than you and come flying in from off-screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really not that uncommon to jump and then unavoidably land on an enemy that sort of suddenly appeared from the other side of the screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The second boss is a Morning Star-wielding stone Buddhist statue (I think). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most of the enemies in this game are a little puzzling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These guys, for example, what are they supposed to be with their weird little Viking helmets? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah, here we some -- have some of the, uh, rather hateful platforming sequences. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While, Niki controls reasonably well, you will find yourself falling through the edge of the platforms, occasionally. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And how are those birds just levitating in the air while remaining completely still? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's all quite baffling. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, each level does have like a little hidden bonus area. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, crouching on that one particular spot for a moment will teleport you to a bonus level, where you actually, uh, want to jump on snake eggs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, some of them will contain a power-up - usually extra lives or an item that changes your outfit from red to white (which gives you the ability to withstand two hits instead of just one before dying). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This comes in handy in the section of the game immediately after the bonus level, where you have to jump and avoid all these deadly bubbles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah, there you see the power-up but I was talking about. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "...Niki..." is a very simple and decidedly flawed game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's still fun to play (at least at certain times). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some levels are boringly simple and others (uh, like this one, for example) are just plain annoying. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, this one's [pretty] awful as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These things just come flying out of nowhere directly at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to, sort of, move through level very, very slowly to avoid dying. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... Overall, I guess this game could stand to be a bit more 'radical'. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sword of Kalin 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Xtalsoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by DOG 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright friends, are you ready for today's R.P.G. Blitz? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Good. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First up, a game whose name causes some confusion, "Sword of Kalin" (otherwise known as "Kalin no Ken" or "Kalin no Tsurugi"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The kanji character means sword, but it's pronounced either "Ken" or "Tsurugi", depending on whether using the Chinese or Japanese reading. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ken" seems to be a bit more common, such as in the word "Kendo". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, by the way, this game was not released outside of Japan, but a fan translation has been made. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, the plot is: 'You must save the Kingdom from evil'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How original. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game was created by Xtalsoft and released by D.O.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Xtalsoft (who spell their name with an X) released a small number of games in the 1980s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you conveniently begin outside the castle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And inside you should talk to the N.P.C.s and hunt down the King. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, the look and feel of "...Kalin" is heavily influenced by "Dragon Quest", right down to the sprites of the various guards in the castles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Look at those guys! Even they're, sort of, like, moving their legs up and down, just like a "Dragon Quest". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the King is not very talky, but he does give you a Fire Rod that allows you to throw fireballs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This consumes Magic Points or 'MP' as it says in the menu. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While you're here you should, you know, buy some potions and get instructions for your first fetch quest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are no Item Shops in "...Kalin" - just guys standing around who will sell you stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so the first thing to do: the Princess is sick and need to find the magic water and some fruit! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, another guy tells you to get a silver bell. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The interface is quite similar "Dragon Quest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's even a menu option to use stairs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However talking will occur automatically. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once out on the World Map you encounter enemies and fight them Action R.P.G.-style. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The one thing "...Kalin" didn't borrow from "Dragon Quest" was turn-based combat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You encounter a group of enemies on it will roll in and run into them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, just like "Ys", it seems best to hit them from perhaps, like, uh, the side slightly, in order to avoid taking too much damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you can hit them from behind that's even better, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, it is [pretty] difficult to avoid taking damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you get cornered and surrounded like I did a second ago, it's [pretty] much Game Over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, fortunately, there is one very cool option: a quick save. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's what the, uh, 'Record' is for. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Use it. (Constantly.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After wandering around on the World Map (uh, which uses, uh, "Dragon Quest" topography of grass, forests, hills, and mountains) you'll find the first village which has a doctor and a weapons and Armor Shop. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the world of "...Kalin" is not huge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think there's [only] maybe five towns (uh, most extremely small, like this one - I mean, three houses), and two castles, and a few dungeons to round the game out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Only] two items are sold (health and magic potions), and there isn't too much equipment either. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are a number of Quest Items, however (such as various keys and statues you need to collect). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also several items that cast magic spells; you don't learn spells you have to get items to cast them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yes, and "...Kalin" is not very generous with its Hit Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Notice that when you Level Up, you actually don't get refilled. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (That's rather nice.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, as I mentioned, the game does have a bit of fetch questing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've just entered this (well, I would hesitate to call it a town; it's more of, like) one house ([it] looks much more impressive on the World Map). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, the well is dry and we need to find the magic powder in order to revive it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, the next town just happens to be the place to find match powder. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you actually have the magic power, then you head back, use it on the well, and then you get the magic water, which is one of the things you need to hear the Princess. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you picked the Princess, you then get a special item as well as a little money from the King. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, overall, this game is much closer to "Dragon Quest (I)", than "Dragon Quest II" (just in, sort of, uh, terms of scope). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You [only] have one party member, the world is [pretty] small, there is no traveling by boat or anything like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The battles are certainly a bit of a pain, simply because it's so easy to get yourself killed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You're basically a step or two away from the death at all times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't think there's any healing magic at all in this - just potions and the occasional doctor, here and there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, there are a couple of nice features. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of them, for example, is that your Magic Points fill back up over time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, you actually have potions you can use to refill your Magic Points quicker. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's something that, uh, "Dragon Quest" didn't have. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The [only] way you could refill Magic Points there was to actually go into an Inn and 'Heal'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another nice feature, as I mentioned, that the, uh, interaction with N.P.C.s is [pretty] much button-free; simply walk up to them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Overall, I say "...Kalin" is worth playing for those curious about a very early "Dragon Quest" knockoff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... Though the [pretty] awful combat and frequent deaths may make you want to pass this one up. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pulsar no Hikari: Space Wars Simulation 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 02 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Soft Pro International 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Soft Pro International 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last episode saw a dearth of F.D.S. games but that's not a problem today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is "Pulsar no Hikari - "Space Wars" Simulation". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A pulsar is a kind of star that blasts out electromagnetic pulses into space. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aficionados of British post=punk will undoubtedly recognize this particular image of a pulsar's emissions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And 'Hikari' means light. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, stars emit light so, "Pulsar no Hikari" is not exactly profound imagery. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The music is quite charming and tuneful, actually. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I'm not sure about any of those names in the credits. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yoshitaka osawa wrote a videogame based novel a few years ago, and I suppose that's very likely the same guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As for Soft Pro, they've published a few FamiCom games (such as the port of "Karateka") but the [only] other FamiCom game they've developed was "Breeder". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was the oddball game where you create robots and watch them fight. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, there are times when 'Chrontendo' totally fails. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is one of them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What this game is all about? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I really have no idea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There were quite a few menu options, some intergalactic maps. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This seems very much in the style of that old Arcade Game; uh, you remember "Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both games have the word 'simulate' in the title, so there is an obvious debt, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, um, in this screen, you fly around and throw missiles at asteroids. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The physics involved seem very weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After turning on your jets, if you're at the side of the screen, it takes a very long time to start moving. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I guess the, uh, point of this is... well, I'm really not sure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing about that these sorts of games is usually (even in English) they're [pretty] hard to figure out (unless you have the manual and you've got to read through it very carefully). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Trying to play one of these things in another language... well, I guess just [pretty] much forget about it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, you can form some kind of space warp, but seriously, what is this about? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's counting off numbers for something? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then when you hit the button, it'll cause you to materialize. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you're in some other screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what is this about? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is that the pulsar? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... And presumably at some point, I guess you would engage in some sort of combat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Judging by the title ('Space War Simulation') though I certainly couldn't find it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here I go again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what happened here? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Out of galaxy'? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is that bad, I guess? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, despite my inability to make heads or tails of this, I don't think it's a really huge loss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Breeder" seemed like a [pretty] pointless game and I can't imagine this is exactly brilliant. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ultima: Kyoufu no Exodus 🇯🇵 // Ultima: Exodus 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 09 🇯🇵 // 1989 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Origin Systems | Newtopia Planning 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 // FCI 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we go, folks! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 From Pony Canyon a port of a classic computer R.P.G., "Ultima III: Exodus". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original game was, of course, from Richard Garriott and Origin Systems, but this version was apparently the work of the mysterious Newtopia Planning. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Though no one really knows who they were or what they actually did on this game.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ultima III" is one of the most massively influential R.P.G.s of all time, and virtually set the template for Japanese console R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, it being a Western title, it gives you much more freedom than your typical J.R.P.G. - being able to create your character, choosing a race, class, and assigning points to your attributes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We saw a bit of the original 1983 Apple II game, back when we covered the first "Dragon Quest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it was also ported to virtually every single computer system that was. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The 1986 Amiga version was definitely the best looking at these early ports. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was [pretty] much faithful to the original but had much more colorful graphics, and better sound, and mouse support. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was also ported to the P.C.-88 (twice), and eventually to the P.C.-98 as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then in 1987, it was ported by Pony Canyon to the M.S.X. and that actually looks exactly the same as the FamiCom version that we're seeing here today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, it was done by Newtopia. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ultima III" has the archetypal R.P.G. plot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 An evil wizard threatens the land and the King wants you to defeat them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That became the default plot for early R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, "Dragon Quest", "Sword of Kalin", and almost every single other damn R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, evil wizards were a big problem back in the hyborian age or however these games supposedly take place. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, naturally can't just walk right through the wizard's, uh, front door. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, you need to run around killing monsters for 20 hours or so, collecting various items (which are conveniently located in the bottom floor of some dungeon). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also very important, making enough money to buy the best weapons (and in this case, enough money to Level Up your character, but we'll discuss that in just a few minutes). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enemies appear visibly on the overworld - and when you make contact you'll be taken to the battle screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom version is completely turn-based. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your characters can move, attack, or cast a spell each turn - and then the enemies will do the same. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other versions there's a bit more of an Action element as you need to actually move quickly or you'll lose your turn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, for characters armed with melee weapons, you need to take several turns approaching them before you can actually attack and hit them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Magic users have these 'undead' and 'repel' spells that will actually do an instant kill for most Level 1 enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Surprisingly, these bills do not use any Magic Points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After a battle enemies will drop a chest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But of course, you can't just open it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your white magic user will have to cast a spell called 'Open' and disable any traps. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Chests will [only] contain cold hard cash - never any sorts of items. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ultima III" features one thing that'll be familiar to most R.P.G. players: the grind. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll spend most of your time walking around the really small World Map, collecting Experience Points and Gold. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, while, obviously, veterans of "Dragon Quest" and "Final Fantasy" will you know have experienced this before, there are some very fundamental differences in the way that exist is played that may frustrate, confuse, and irritate Japanese R.P.G. fans. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The rather time-consuming battles, for example, in which you can spend a certain amount of time simply approaching the enemy 40 can actually attack them, is just one thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the game is not really linear at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can immediately go almost anywhere in the world on the map from the get-go. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Likewise, the first time you come across will have the most powerful armor that can be bought in shops. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while the dungeons and the expensive gear are accessible, you simply aren't strong enough to survive the dungeons or rich enough to buy the armor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Far more troubling to most R.P.G. fans will be the Experience and Leveling system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It works almost the opposite as you might think it would. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, when a party member kills a monster, [only] that party member gets Experience Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can Level Up every hundred points, which works out to members killing around 25 monsters to get to, uh, Level 2. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, early in the game your magic users can come on tours very easily using their 'Undead' and 'Repel' spells. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, It's very easy to level up magic users; you just keep casting those spells over and over again, each battle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To Level Up your non-magic users, you'll need to have your wizard standby during battle, while your sword welders take out monsters one at a time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's one thing, but here's the real catch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Leveling Up [only] increases your maximum Hit Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's the [only] change made to your character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your attack, defense, and magic remain unchanged. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But when you Level Up, more powerful monsters appear on the World Map. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, I foolishly went ahead and Leveled Up each character Level 5. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then when I encounter this group of giants, I found myself getting slaughtered. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The new enemies do more damage and are harder to kill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But other than having more Hit Points, my party hasn't gotten any stronger. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, Leveling Up makes your characters a weaker in comparison to the monsters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you say, 'This is madness! Are you saying that you shouldn't Level Up?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, quite frankly, 'Yes. What you should do is stay at Level 1, kill hundreds and hundreds of monsters, get lots of Experience Points and money, but don't talk to Lord -- Lord British and Level Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead use your money to buy the best weapons and armor, uh, max out your money, and *then* Level Up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes, and once you've gotten past Level 1, you'll find those handy "Dandy" spells ('Repel' and 'Undead') don't work on stronger monsters, so they become quite useless. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This means that your magic users are going to have to actually kill a lot of monsters by hand, in order to get any Experience Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, if you want to Level Up your magic users, you should really do most of the experience gathering while they're still Level 1. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, at some point, you'll probably also want to visit the hidden town of Dawn, which [only] appears when both moons are new. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll have to find the particular spot where it appears, then hit the B button over and over again to make the, uh, the moons change. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then the town will magically appear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can buy better weapons here, not to mention keys, uh, tents (for healing), magical sands (for temporarily freezing enemies in battles), also horses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is really the [only] place you can get like the the best weapons (other than the magical weapons that you actually have to find later in the game). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ranged weapons are actually very helpful to have in this game because that way you can start attacking monsters as soon as the battle begins, rather than having to actually walk up to them and then start whacking on them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will notice the best armor weapons are outrageously expensive, so you need to buy all that stuff and then go out and then get some more Gold. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also in the towns, you'll usually find a bar (where the bartender will sell you hints), as well as the Inn (where you can save your game), a hospital (where you can get cured of a diseases you might have caught). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it should be noted that staying at the end will not actually refill your Hit Points and Magic Points, unlike most R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually replenishing your Hit Points is a bit of a pain. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even when you Level Up, it doesn't fill up your Hit Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have a 'Heal' spell, but that [only] replenishes a few at a time so you, sort of, have to use the 'Heal' spell over and over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, at no point in the game do your magic users actually learn a better 'Heal' spell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's never a spell, for example, to completely refill your Hit Points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so you've got lots of Gold and lots Experience Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, what? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, first of all, you want to increase your stats, so you'll need to find this secret Island. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you reach a certain level, pirate ships will start to appear in the water. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To find the ship it actually makes sense to simply enter and exit a town repeatedly until suddenly one appears on the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then fight the pirates and take control their ship. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Does this sound familiar? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, well, "Final Fantasy" seems to have borrowed the idea directly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you have the ship, are you off to explore new lands? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, sort of. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not quite like "Dragon Quest II" slay there's like a whole new world to explore. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's [only] a handful of little islands around the main continent. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What you'll really want to do is, sort of, sail around until you find this randomly wandering whirlpool that goes around, uh, somewhere in the ocean. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Entering the Whirlpool will cause you to wash up on the island of 'Ambrosia'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, there is a mythical island named after a salad made with fruit and whipped cream. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hidden somewhere on this island are shrines that will allow you to raise your stats. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, the ship moves absurdly slow. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also run into sea monsters and have to battle with them if you're not careful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that Whirlpool could be really hidden anywhere in the entire ocean. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! There, I found it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, we are finally off to Ambrosia. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is really the [only] way that you can actually get your characters any stronger. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes, and after reaching ambrogio your ship disappears. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you have to find another hidden pirate ship somewhere on the island in order to leave. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you want to go back you have to find another pirate ship and so on and so forth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you were here, we're actually looking for these four shrines on the island that will allow you to actually raise your stats. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, here I've reached the Strength Shrine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Talking to the guy will raise a character's strength one point at a time for the price of $100 per point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, you actually have to pay for stat increases in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, if you want to raise your Fighter's Strength from 25 to 75, expect to pay $5,000. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, you'll want to raise your other stats as well - not to mention those of your other characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, you need to raise your Magic stats, in order to increase M.P.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you might want to set aside, say, oh... $50,000 or $60,000. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you take in maybe $50 per battle, by the way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll want to head to the dungeons (which are in the traditional first-person view) looking various magic items down there in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, you have to cast a spell in order to actually see in the dungeons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are other things as well (teleportation gates, special Ultimate Weapons you need to find) but, uh, once you've got all that you head over to Exodus' castle and destroy it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing not in "Ultima III": boss battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's not even any sort of, like, final confrontation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you reach the game's final lair, you simply place these magic cards on the shrine and that's it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, "Ultima III"'s influence on later on later R.P.G.s was enormous. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just consider some of the elements that found their way from this game into "Dragon Quest" and "Final Fantasy". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The World Map with its topography of castles, towns, caves and dungeons, the separate battle screens for facing enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game's teleportation gates found its way into "Dragon Quest II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also traveling via ship and fighting pirates in order to get a ship. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this game you tried to obtain four cards; in "Final Fantasy" of you have the four orbs and crystals, not to mention the default four member party. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this game, you'll find increasingly better and more expensive weapons and armor (including Dragon Armor). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the best armor is often some kind of magical armor, which seems to be found can't be bought. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tents and keys are items which found their way into "Dragon Quest" and "Final Fantasy". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, in every other R.P.G. towns will contain Inns, Armor Shops, Weapon Shops, and Item Shops. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ultima III" definitely feels like American game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It has, sort of, old-fashioned Protestant work ethic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Playing this game, you can almost feel Richard Garriott standing behind you, wearing a frock coat and a starched collar, telling you that he won't be powerful enough to kill dragons and wyverns you're going to have to earn that power the hard way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Games like "Dragon Quest" and "Final Fantasy", offer out little rewards - stretched out like breadcrumbs along a trail. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You step outside the castle, kill three slimes, and 'Tada!' you've, you've reached Level 2. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, you know, really for such a brilliant, groundbreaking, and influential game "Ultima III" also manages to be boring, repetitive, headache-inducing and sometimes just plain idiotic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game simply offers too few rewards for all the work you have to do. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The games inspired by "Ultima III" really improved the genre to such a great degree that it's really difficult or impossible to go back to "Ultima III", at this point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While I'd certainly recommend playing the game a little bit, for curiosity's sake, I don't know if we'll actually be able to sit through the entire thing. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🧧 A Very Special Chrontendo Update ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, no one's perfect, especially not me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I made a few glaring omissions that knowledgable viewers have pointed out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, it's time for a very special 'Chrontendo' update. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🧧 Update on Hokuto no Ken ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You haven't forgotten "Hokuto no Ken", have you? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, of course, not. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the things that drove me crazy was the seemingly endless first level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It went on forever! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it turns out, you have to enter one of the buildings to move forward. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you see that little kid, press both up and the two buttons; then you'll enter the next area. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm speechless! It's like a whole new world is opened up! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's even a boss and then you go on to Level 2! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, the game is still bad (maybe even worse). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's still a bad game; now there's just more of it. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🧧 Update on Makai Island ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On a more positive note, when playing Capcom's "Higemaru Makaijima", released in April 1987, (six months ago in 'Chrontendo' time) I wondered if it been considered for U.S. release. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the answer is yes, it was localized under the name of "Makai Island"... and then never released. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, the ROM of the prototype has been floating around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... And the game was even written up on 'Lost Levels'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when checking my files, it turns out I even had a copy of the ROM back then. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoops! My mistake. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the lesson from "Hokuto no Ken" and "Makaijima" is: Do your research before doing an episode. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🧧 Update on Photon ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, just last episode, we saw "Photon: The Ultimate Game on Planet Earth". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I assumed this title was, uh, based off a licensed property, but it couldn't really turn anything up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, there was a U.S. T.V. show called photon on the air briefly, but there didn't seem to be a connection. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, it turns out 'Photon: The Ultimate Game on Planet Earth' was a franchise of high-end laser tag arenas, started by one George Carter in Houston in 1984. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was spun off into a T.V. show (which is actually a [pretty] amazing piece of mid-1980s camp). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] involves a teen who was recruited to join an interplanetary group of freedom fighters, uh, based on his skills at laser tag. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, it is odd that the "Photon" video game was released in Japan and not in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure what Takara had to do with "Photon" or if there was any recognition of the name in Japan in 1987. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By some weird coincidence, uh, scenes from "Photon" were actually used in the "Super Mario Bros. Super Show", during the 'Club Mario' sequences, under the name 'Space Scout Theater'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You gotta dig those crazy '80s laser effects. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, some of this show is actually shot in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, of course, to go along with the Laser Tag arenas and the T.V. show, there were also various, uh, licensed products, such as, like, home Laser Tag sets (as seen here). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps Takara released these in Japan, but I couldn't really find any evidence. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also a series of "Photon" toys was available. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, is some of the action figures. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, when we look at the manufacturer's name, we find it is LJN, who also released countless bad video games for the N.E.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's all very curious, but I don't know that Takara and LJN have any connection. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Conclusion: Back to Chrontendo ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, at any rate, let's go back to the episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Topple Zip 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 09 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bothtec 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not that long ago, I theorized F.D.S. was originally home to marquee titles like "...Zelda" and "Castlevania", but it's slowly becoming a repository for cheap crap. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Partially because the big name titles are now being released on cartridges take advantage of the extra ROM space and those fancy new memory mappers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Topple Zip" is a prime example the cheap crappy game released by bowtech the guys behind that weirdo game "Relics" (which played kind of like "Metroid" on codine cough syrup). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Topple Zip" is more like, I don't know, maybe if "TwinBee" had been held back in school a few years. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Relics", "Topple Zip" is not an original game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, it's actually a part of an M.S.X. title from 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [The] title screen says was created by Trump Magic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If anyone out there knows who Trump Magic is, well then I guess you're smarter than me. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, the M.S.X. version is ugly, choppy and quite a mess (like [pretty] much every other Shooter on the system). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why anyone felt the need to remake this for the FamiCom is a complete mystery. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also a mystery: just who is responsible for this port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's been noted, uh, that the game shares some sound effects with LJN's X-Men game, so presumably some sort of connection exists. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Topple Zip" is a cute little Shoot-'em-Up, but of the, sort of, non-violent sort. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather than blowing up other aircraft, you simply bump into them, which will give you, like, a capsule. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You then shoot the capsule and get some sort Power-Up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the levels will wrap around infinitely, but at certain points you will come across these little warps that I'll take you to other levels (well, sometimes). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other times you'll actually get warped back to the same level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is the, uh, the city level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and oddly enough objects do have a Z-Axis dimension to them, so you can actually hit the buildings that you see there, as well as like the the cliffs what you see, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, um, by 'hit' I mean your when your ship comes in contact, it will, sort of, shake, make an annoying noise, and then actually pass right through. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 None of that seems very enjoyable or worthwhile, though is entirely possible I'm missing the point of this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, why does your ship have like plungers on either side of it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what does 'Topple Zip' even mean? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At some point, you do reach this level (which behaves more like conventional Shoot-'em-Up) but the game doesn't really get any better. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's just more explosions and more grating sound effects. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, for you Cute-'em-Up fans, uh, sorry you better pass on this one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Esper Bouken Tai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 13 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by NMK 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jaleco is back doing what Jaleco does best: making weird games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Esper Bouken Tai" (meaning 'Esper Adventure Team') is sadly not up to par with last episode's "Bio Senshi Dan". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, this game was developed by in NMK, who were also the guys behind "Argus" (that Vertical Shoot-'em-Up from back in 1986) the FamiCom port of which was also published by Jaleco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, clearly these guys had some sort of deal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, your character is is pissed-off looking little kid in shorts, who somehow manages to carry around a gigantic hammer, with which to smash things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's funny how just whips that hammer out of nowhere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hitting the little box will cause some money to be collected (somehow without opening the box itself). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That game has a rather handy new in-game map, as we saw a second ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The world of "Esper Bouken Tai" is quite large, a huge network full of tunnels (both horizontal and vertical) so the map is actually quite handy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, aside from that, the most notable thing about "Esper Bouken Tai" is... (well, it's) the jumping. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your character has super jumping skills and can jump way high up in the air. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I assume this is because of his psychic powers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there's a lot of things in this game I don't really understand (the plot being one of them). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The subtitle given on the box is, uh, 'Devils Fortress' and the final boss is like a giant devil creature. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems at various household objects have come to life. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A group of ESP users band together in order to, uh, combat the menace to mankind. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, I guess that sounds a lot like the plot to "Mother". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Weird, since I mentioned "Mother" in "Bio Senshi Dan" as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The rather odd Japanese T.V. commercial for this (uh, which you can find on the web [pretty] easily) stresses the household objects angle, and features a bunch of stop-motion talking vacuums and whatnot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The different sections are connected by doors or hatches. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Quite a few are locked but you can unlock some by touching the statue. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It begims -- gives a, uh -- a ding; the doors open, presumably. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At some point you'll need to backtrack and go through doors that are locked previously. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, some objects are actually quite useful. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, the bed will fill up your Life Meter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess, sort of, like an inn, in a way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't think we could really quite classify "Esper Bouken Tai" as an R.P.G., though it definitely borrows from R.P.G. games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your character stats can be increased throughout the game, and you'll need to collect money in treasure chests, and get other party members, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I guess the game has some bright attractive-looking backgrounds. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, while the character and his hammer are rather lame-looking, admittedly it's kind of fun to jump around all crazy in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Plays this sort of, like, wandering through these areas with no clear goal in mind. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably due to my ignorance but, even in Japan, this game doesn't seem to be considered any kind of cult classic. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Indora no Hikari 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Kemco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 R.P.G. number twapp, "Indora no Hikari". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah yes, the old weathered stone logo (a classic), and a sparkly flair on a character for 'Hikari'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you might remember from three games ago, 'Hikari' means light. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Get it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's clever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then we see the magic name of Kemco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kemco holds a special place in my heart since "Dough Boy" (from 1985) was one of the first really awful kusoge-type games we saw the system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since then they released... well, basically crap. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They seem to specialize in ports of U.S. Computer Games, something they can continue to do in the future, as they did the N.E.S. ports of "Shadowgate", and "Deja Vu", and later "Blackthorn" and "Daikatana" in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last game we've seen from them was a port of the second 'Spy vs. Spy' game back in March. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not clear who developed "Indora no Hikari", but it seems to have higher production values than earlier Kemco-developed titles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most of those games looked really terrible and extremely cheap. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I actually kind of liked the music in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, it does seem rather repetitive, but it's, sort of, strangely hypnotic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, a mom and dad want you to go save the Kingdom or whatever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Talk to Mom and she'll give you 100 Gold. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In some way, "Indora..." hues more closely to "Dragon Quest" than to "Sword of Kalin". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It doesn't start you off in the castle so there's one original feature. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so you know the drill by now. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Walk around town, talk to the townspeople, you know, [the] town has a shop, you can buy weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Hint, don't buy the knife because you already have one in your possession.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Old-School R.P.G.-style, you need to equip your weapons and armor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the little tables found inside of the shops seem taken directly from "Dragon Quest". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you're ready to go, head on out to the overworld to kill some monsters (which are actually visible on the screen in the form of bouncing blobs). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, unlike "Sword of Kalin", the battles are straight-up turn-based (right out of "Dragon Quest"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One guide you can use to judge the balance with R.P.G. is how hard are the very first battles you encounter? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, I took one step outside of town and ran into this guy... who has quite a few -- few Hit Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually I defeat him but it cost me like half my Hit Points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then immediately I run into another one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... Luckily, it's actually [pretty] easy in this game to -- to escape. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then I run into another have the exact same monster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... So, I guess it's actually time to go to the end after just one battle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are easier enemies floating around (like these rather nondescript-looking slimes) but the pacing of the game just doesn't feel right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think it, uh, does take a while to Level Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't think I ever actually got to Level 2, as far as I know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and then you also battle some kind of crazy snail with wings, I guess. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, it looks like I'm headed up to, uh, to the Death Mountain. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Clearly the World Maps are done "...Zelda"-style, rather than, you know, in the, uh, "Dragon Quest"-style (gigantic character Walking around on a miniature map). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, you know, "Indora no Hikari" actually looks [pretty] decent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I actually like the backgrounds. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Look at all those, you know, cute little trees and things.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's certainly not dogshit-ugly like, uh, "Mariah Jarvis" or "Roy's". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later on, you'll eventually even get other, uh, party members that appears. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, while this is a straight-ahead "Dragon Quest" clone (and probably not that great) at least the game seems more or less bearable. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Falsion 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're suddenly having a burst of Shoot-'em-Up activity here on the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's another F.D.S. title from Konami, "Falsion" - a Shoot-'em-Up, but not your standard Horizontal Konami Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nope, it's a 3D Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note there are two options here: 3D and Normal Play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, "Falsion", sort of, resembles "AfterBurner" in space. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, since "AfterBurner" came out in late 1980s, there couldn't have been any direct influence. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, about the 3D option. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Earlier 3D games (like Square's "Toba Dasa dice acuson") made use of, sort of, standard, uh, red and blue tinted glasses (though you can't really see that in the video). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, Nintendo did develop these high-tech electronic 3D goggles, similar to the Sega Master System's 3D goggles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This allowed for a 3D image in normal colors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Highway Star" also used this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you were to to switch to the 3D version of "Falsion", you would see to rapidly alternating offset images. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, these goggles were never released in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Falsion"'s a [pretty] decent game; the sprite base 3D viewpoints [pretty] convincing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your objective is simply to survive each level and then defeat a boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, power-ups will appear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The red ones give you homing missiles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing about the missiles: 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you have enough, you can take out the bosses very easily (since they will homed in on the boss's weak spot). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, by playing conservatively, collecting missiles, and just not dying you will have more than enough missiles to quickly destroy the bosses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each level has a different theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here you're flying over a forest, it appears. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess "Falsion" is similar to "AfterBurner". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's fun but in short doses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not what I would call a deep game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] simply involves shooting enemy ships and then -- as they approach and then getting out of the way before they get too close. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some enemies will actually, sort of, stick around until you destroy them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The missiles are useful for the hard-to-hit ones. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This next boss has a little buddy that looks like the dragon from "Space Harrier". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose this game is actually closer to "Space Harrier" than to "AfterBurner". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The enemies like come right at you in a conga line and then swerve to the sides and going right past you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most of the enemy's actions don't really make much sense in real world terms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since your ship is presumably moving forward, this means enemy ships would be flying towards you, then suddenly switching into reverse gear, and then flying backwards while shooting at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wouldn't it make more sense them simply fly past you, turn around, and then shoot from behind? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As with a lot of these sorts of games, it can be difficult to know how close objects are to your ship. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Frequently I found myself colliding with an enemy or a projectile that was closer than it appeared. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (I love this really bizarre little, uh, message you get at the end of that particular boss battle.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, I'd say about 75% of the time when I died, it was actually a surprise. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I thought I had enough room to pass in front of the object in question. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Falsion" is a technically impressive game, but not nearly as involving or playable as something like "Salamander". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Haja no Fuuin 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ASCII 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're entering the homestretch here, folks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our next R.P.G. is "Haja no Fuuin". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Haja' literally means 'supreme evil'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Fuuin' is a seal. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The English version is known as "Seal of the Dark Lord", which seems like a [pretty] good translation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Haja no Fuuin" is a rather bizarre over-the-shoulder perspective style. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The camera is fixed behind your character (or rather more to the side) and the background changes as you move. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also a little map near the bottom to help you see where you're moving to. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, you might look at all these extra panels here and think, 'Hey, this looks kind of like a Computer Game.'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you'd be right because "Haja no Fuuin" was originally released on the P.C.-88 and FM-7 in 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shortly afterwards, it came out on the M.S.X., as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All these Computer versions look very similar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And were all developed and published by co Gato studio. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the FamiCom version was actually released by ASCII. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And a number of changes have been made (most notably in the battle screens). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, with the M.S.X. version, the battle screens are, well, they're actually, sort of, boring. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, here on the FamiCom you have this crazy little animation of you actually running up and attacking the enemy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another rather unusual feature: you can actually see the enemies on the World Map (sort of in the background) and you can actually choose to attack them or -- or not. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, we find ourselves in a rather odd situation today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Something completely unprecedented has occurred. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this time in Japan, games were normally console-exclusive (with the exception of a handful of, like, you know, older titles like "Spy vs. Spy" and "Choplifter"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, "Haja no Fuuin" had a simultaneous release on the FamiCom and the Sega Master System. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually, the Master System version came out about five days earlier on October 18th 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it was actually released by Sega, themselves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sega's version is superior and exists in English, so that's the one we'll be focusing on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Expect it to be covered in "Chronsega Episode 4". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, we'll be seeing more of this game shortly. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Minelvaton Saga 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Random House 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it is time for our next R.P.G., this time from a publisher that you know and trust. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Well, I guess you can trust them some of the times.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Minelvaton Saga" is published by Taito, who had previously released the absolutely terrible "Mirai shinwa Jarvis" back in June. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Will they redeem themselves with this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, let's see. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, there is an honest-to-God introduction, unlike Jarvis, but developer on this is a small company called Random House (absolutely no relation to the book publisher). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They are certainly an odd choice to make an R.P.G., since they specialized in 'Shogi' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've already seen one title from them, "Marina, show me". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both 'Shogi' and Role Playing Games are derived from tabletop games, so I guess it, sort of, makes sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the debt to "Dragon Quest (I)"s [pretty] clear here in the opening sequence. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You walk around town and look for the King. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Man! He's got a [pretty] big rug in that room!). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are of course, other N.P.C.s to interact with. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note there really aren't any, sort of, in-game cutscenes like in the beginning "Dragon Quest II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One nice thing: 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is no 'Talk' button; you can just walk up to someone and then the dialogue screen will come up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This town actually has a Bar (or a Tavern, I suppose). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's a little dungeon town. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But an obstruction actually prevents you from getting very far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's like one, sort of, juicy looking treasure chest that you actually can't get to at this point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, you have all the normal standard things in any R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have an Inn and Item Shop. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Item Shop will sell you some recovery items (for example, a pill and antidote). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you start off with a bit of money. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (500 Gold! That's actually [pretty] good for an R.P.G. to begin with!). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you've shopped and talked, head on out to the world and start killing monsters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And once you do this, there's really, sort of, nothing out of the ordinary. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have your standard Japanese R.P.G. overworld. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then we... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Uh... One thing about this: 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 It actually has very nicely paved roads!). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once we get the first random encounter, you'll see that "Minelvaton..." is an Action R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the battles sadly resemble those of "Sword of Kalin". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your run up to me that attacked them but hearing it hit the B button to use your sword. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you actually will always (almost always) take some damage yourself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If there is a smart way to fight without losing any health, I didn't discover it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Still wandering around.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, I've encountered some tougher enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Fleeing is [pretty] simple. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, you might note that "Minelvaton Saga" has some [pretty] big H.P. numbers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start out with 800 Hit Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That, uh, sounds [pretty] impressive but it actually goes down very quickly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like, uh, "Dragon Quest" the overworld is populated by, sort of, towns and dungeons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the first town; you can buy weapons and armor, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I chose something called the, uh, the Razor Knife. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Or maybe the 'Laser Knife'? [I'm] not quite sure.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And naturally, it's very easy to get killed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... I found this tower has some sort of way-too-tough enemy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] not sure what the heck this guy is supposed to be, but [it] turns out he is bad news. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, nothing too out of the ordinary here - sort of, your standard 'Dragon Quest'-style game with real-time Action battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] doesn't seem to have made too much of a splash in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Once you get to get to a bridge (and that's always, sort of, a bad sign in these games). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll find there's a little dungeon up, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, granted, I didn't make that much progress in this game; I didn't really get to Level Up too far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the enemies in this first dungeon here are actually way too tough for me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, so far, nothing that I've seen indicates this is anything more than your absolutely typical by-the-numbers boring, very early Japanese R.P.G.. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 Chrontendo Presents: Game Studio Profiles: Irem ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our next game is another Irem title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But first, let's take a moment to look at something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Chrontendo' will occasionally do these little profiles on the companies that make the games we like to play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our first developer profile was back in "...Episode 20" when we looked at the history of the British game studio, Rare. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Intro: The History of IREM ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next up let's [delve] into the history of Irem, a somewhat underappreciated game developer, publisher, and manufacturer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Irem was founded in 1969 by kindo tsujimoto, under the name IPM (International Playing Machines) in Osaka. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1974 IPM Ltd. was formed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, the primary purpose of the company was distributing Arcade machines. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸IPM Invaders ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1977, they partnered with the Japanese electronic company, Nanao, to begin producing Arcade video games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like many video game companies of the time, they got their foot in the door by producing a "Space Invaders" clone (in this case, "IPM Invaders" in 1979). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this time in Japan, the demand for "Space Invaders" was so huge that everyone (including Sega and Nintendo) were producing exact knockoffs. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# IPM Rebrands as IREM + Founds IRM ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then in 1979, IPM changed his name to Irem (for International Rental Electronic Machines). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A separate company, IRM Company Limited, was also founded. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Moon Patrol ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Irem began to release more original games - their major "BreakThru" being a popular game called "Moon Patrol" in 1982. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This fun and rather addictive game was pioneering and its use of parallax scrolling, and was ported to [pretty] much every video game system in existence at that time. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸10 Yard Fight ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another important game was "10-Yard Fight" from 1983. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was one of the first semi-realistic question Arcade Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And was, of course, later ported successfully to the FamiCom and N.E.S.. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Tsujimoto Leaves IREM for IRM (Capcom) ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then in 1983, there was a big shake up in the company. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 IRM had spun off into a completely independent company. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then in 1983 Irem founder, kinzel tsujimoto, left Irem to become the head of IRM (which was now known as 'Capcom'). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Kung-Fu Master ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite this, Irem forged ahead and, in 1984, released the popular and highly influential "Spartan X" (known as "Kung-Fu Master" in the U.S.). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With "Kung-Fu Master" Irem virtually invented the Beat-'em-Up genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've covered the FamiCom port some time ago, but you may recall "Kung-Fu..." as being one of the first games to have, like, sort of, like, a modern video game structure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In which, you traveled through a horizontally scrolling level, defeated a sub-boss, went up one floor, and then so on until the final boss on the last floor. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# IREM's Early FamiCom Arcade Ports ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Irem was one of the first third-party developers to release games for the new FamiCom in 1985 with some parts of their Arcade Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo themselves released "Kung-Fu" for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo seem to have a [pretty] good relationship with Irem, At the time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both "10-Yard Fight" and "Kung-Fu" were launched titles for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the United States. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Kid Niki: Radical Ninja [mentioned, not seen] ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Kid Niki" was, sort of, the logical follow-up to "Kung-Fu Master" the next year. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Lode Runner III: The Golden Labyrinth ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But Irem also found success in a series of Arcade Games, based on the U.S. computer series 'Lode Runner'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seen here is "Lode Runner III" from 1985. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Lode Runner" became very successful in Japan, both in arcades and on consoles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've already seen, uh, four 'Lode Runner' games for the FamiCom (not all of them by Irem). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By 1987, the series had run its course and Irem seemed to be in a bit of a rut and needed something new. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, it turned out to be Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸R-Type ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Irem released a few Shoot'em-Ups that year "Mr. Heli", "Image Fight", and (the one that became an item's flagship series) "R-Type". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "R-Type" took the new style of Shoot-'em-Up (as pioneered by Konami's "Gradius") and made it even cooler (if such a thing was even possible). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You had a similar power-up system to "Gradius", um, but the ability to charge up your primary laser cannon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you had an added component to your arsenal, the invincible Force Pod (which can operate both attached your ship and separately). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Combine the innovative gameplay with incredible graphics, design, and bosses and the result was the first huge success for the second stage of Irem's career. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Vigilante ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Beat-'em-Ups and Shoot-'em-Ups would be the focus of much of Irem's output for the late '80s and 1990s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, "Vigilante" (a pseudo-sequel to "Kung-Fu Master") which updates the action from a Chinese pagoda to the city streets. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your objective: 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 Take out the punks that kidnapped you girlfriend. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While Irem was primarily an Arcade Game manufacturer, they did continue to release titles for home consoles, including Arcade ports (such as the "R-Type" ports for the P.C. Engine). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Holy Diver ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But they did also give original titles like "Holy Diver" for the FamiCom in 1989 (which was a straight up a "Castlevania" clone). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Shinsenden ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That year also gave us "Shinsenden" (an R.P.G. - a genre not normally associated with Irem). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Metal Storm ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And another cool title that year was "Metal Storm" from 1990. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game even got a U.S. release. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Overall, however, I really, sort of, focused on the arcades. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Hammerin' Harry ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another franchise was created with the wacky Beat-'em-Up, "Hammerin' Harry", (sort of an anti-Eminent Domain-themed game). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You whallop on the employees of a construction company with your giant hammer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Hammerin' Harry" spawned several sequels, the most recent being "Hammerin' Hero" for the PSP. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Major Title ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Irem also continued to make, uh, more mainstream titles, such various puzzle Arcade Games, and a Sports Game - a nice looking Golf Game from 1990, "Major Title". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Air Duel ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, in 1990, was "Air Duel". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the surface, "Air Duel" is a typical Vertical Shoot-'em-Up, but what separates it from the pack is the art design. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was the first Irem game to, sort of, demonstrate Irem's unique new graphical style (uh, sort of, a highly-detailed and stylized futuristic look) that would be used in their 1990s Shooters and Beat-'em-Ups. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Cosmic Cop ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This style would give Irem's later Arcade Games a very distinctive and recognizable feel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, in "Cosmic Cop" from 1991. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was yet another Horizontal Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But "Cosmic Cop" had some of the most detailed and incredible graphics seen in arcades, with huge ships and fiery explosions. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Undercover Cops ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Undercover Cops" was one of Irem's last Arcade Beat-'em-Ups and was an amazing showcase for the fantastic graphics Irem was getting out of their hardware. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was a standard Beat-'em-Up, sure, but nothing else out there really looked quite like this. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸R-Type Leo ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, Irem continue to produce sequels to its most popular game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "R-Type II" hit arcades in 1989, followed by a third game, "R-Type Leo" in 1992. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This would be the last "R-Type" Arcade Game (future sequels being released for consoles [only]). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# IREM's Struggles In The Early 1990s ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the early 1990s, Irem was in [pretty] bad shape. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I assume the emergence of, uh, the One-on-One Fighter caught Irem off guard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Its, uh, favored genres (Beat-'em-Ups and Shoot-'em-Ups), sort of, having fallen out of favor. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸In The Hunt ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, they did manage to release a few late-period classics, for example, the impossibly good-looking "In The Hunt". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was an underwater submarine Shooter - sort of, an infinitely better version of their old FamiCom game, "Squoon". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a prime example of the in-house art style established in "Air Duel". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Gun Force II ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Finally, in 1994, Irem released "Geo Storm" (a.k.a. "Gun Force II") an insane over the top Run-'n'-Gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The culmination of Irem's Arcade Games in the 1990s, "Gun Force II" featured huge bosses, spectacular explosions, massive firepower, fluid animation, and all kinds of crazy stuff going on [pretty] much all the time. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# The End of IREM As We Know It ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, this was the end of the road for Irem as we know it, with the production of Arcade Games ceasing in 1994. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Metal Slug ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Members of Irem's development team left to form another group called Nazca - which, of course, released the much-loved "Metal Slug" for SNK in 1996. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Metal Slug" is obviously very much in the style of Irem's 1990s Arcade Games, and it seems almost like a sequel to "Gun Force II". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Conclusion: IREM's Glory Days Are Behind ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As for Irem, well, it was reorganized in 1997 and taken over by Nanao. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A few ports and compilations, uh, were released in the late 1990s for the Saturn and the PlayStation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And by the early 2000s, Irem was occasionally releasing games for the PlayStation 2. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Such titles as "R-Type Final" and "Steambot Chronicles" - they were, uh, [pretty] well received. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, while Irem is still currently an active company, unfortunately, its glory days are far far behind. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Youkai Yashiki 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Casio 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We actually have two Irem games this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though this one was [only] released by Irem; It's not actually an Irem-produced title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's "Youkai Yashiki", (literally 'Yokai mansion'). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yokai, of course, being a, sort of, Japanese ghost which found its way into so many video games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the way, this little, uh, introduction here is actually unique to the FamiCom version of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, Yokai Yaki is a rather simple little Action Platformer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your character is armed with (well) what appears to be some sort of gun that kills ghosts... somehow. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, your health is represented by what appeared to be batteries. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, maybe you're some ghost-eliminating robot? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (I -- I doubt it.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... Taking out the fireballs, by the way, it will give you some additional health. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, of course, as in many an old FamiCom game, hitting enemies can be quite tricky at times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I mentioned this was not originally an Irem game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's actually the port of a 1986 M.S.X. game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why so many M.S.X. games this episode? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original was by Casio. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, I assume it's *that* Casio (the Japanese watch and electronics manufacturer). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's also known as "Boy Knight" and "Haunted House". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because it was released in Europe as well, it's actually a little better known the FamiCom version (at least in the West) - sort of, like Konami's "...Maze of Galious". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, this game is, sort of, a little similar in structure to "...Maze of Galious". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, by that, I mean you're running around in (what I assume is) a shrine, made out of a series of interconnected rooms with lots of ladders everywhere, looking for various objects. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you fight a boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though "Youkai Yashiki" is much simpler than "...Maze of Galious". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There aren't any shops or items to buy, no Experience Points, or any of that tomfoolery. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just shooting monsters and climbing ladders and jumping around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will find the occasional power-up to refill your Life Bar or something but nothing too crazy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main challenge is figuring your way around the rooms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This can be -- be made trickier by the fact there is no on-screen indication as to whether or not you can exit a room by the left or right sides. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Many games would indicate, 'You can't go this way.', by having brick walls or something running up the side. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But here, 'Nope!'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll just need to try to walk off the edge of the screen and if you hit an invisible wall, you just can't go that way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I should mention that the layout of each level has been substantially changed for the FamiCom version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Levels seem bigger and a bit harder to find your way around in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you've collected all five scrolls, drop down that purple well and be prepared to take on the boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, by the way, that's not the boss right there - that were a little ardvark-looking thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, I could not (for the life of me) figure out how to defeat this boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like a giant, uh, ghost head (female ghost head) but its hair prevents you from actually getting close enough to hit it with the gun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This witch or demon will actually cause the boss to materialize, right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I assume you need to hit the boss in the face or mouth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it seems impossible to get a hit in without standing right in the way of the hair. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, there are no visual cues, that the boss is actually taken any damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, really, who knows? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Shooting the hair doesn't seem to do anything either. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess it's no loss, as "Yokai Yashiki" isn't a very thrilling-looking game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It makes you wonder when we're going to see some great games from Irem. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Spoiler alert! It'll be in the early 1988. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Momotarou Densetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 26 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I suppose the biggest original title for the FamiCom this episode would be this one, from Hudson. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's "Momotarou Densetsu" (or "Peach Boy Legend", as it's also-called on the title screen) - the first game in Hudson's long-lasting 'Momotaro' franchise. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The timing of this game is a little weird, but we'll discuss that next episode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But hey! Look at this: a nicely illustrated title screen, catchy music... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's Momotaro and his three animal helpers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so who exactly is this Momotaro guy? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, he's a heroic young boy from Japanese legend. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Someone that probably all Japanese kids would be familiar with.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The current version of the legend goes that his elderly parents found a magic peach floating in the water. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When they went to eat it, Momotaro popped out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is detailed in the Hudson's wackily anachronistic opening sequence. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Look, she's got a washing machine; isn't that nutty!). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, here Momotaro appears. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoa! Can they really show that in a video game? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the way, 'momo' is Japanese for 'peach'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, Momotaro'r heroics involve slaying demons and heading off to onigashima ('demon island'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there is a bit of confusion regarding the Momotaro games, so let me see if I can clarify something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hudson released two Momotaro games quite quickly: this one and a spin-off in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What we are looking at is "Momotarou Densetsu" ('Densetsu' meaning legend). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The spin-off game is "Momotaro Dentetsu" (meaning 'Electric Railway'). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Momotaro Dentetsu" is a video Board Game in which moment Momotaro travels around in a train. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are two separate series of games, though "Momotaro Dentetsu" is the longer-lived series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hudson's actually still releasing them today. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, of all the games this episode, Momotaru is probably the closest to an exact clone of "Dragon Quest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's okay because It also has the highest production values if any of this episode's R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You play it [pretty] much like "Dragon Quest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, there's the inn, you start off with 100 Gold, uh, you go in to buy some weapons and armor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the Weapon Shop, right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, once you buy something, don't forget to actually equip it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then of course, there's the various N.P.C.s that you have to run around talking to. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hitting the A button will bring up your status screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] shows all your stats. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (And, oh yeah, I'd better equip that armor.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, once you've, sort of, been done fooling around in the village, then you head out onto the overworld and start your exploring. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the overworld (as you can see) looks very similar to that of "Dragon Quest". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The balance of the game is also almost identical to "Dragon Quest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enemies start out [pretty] weak and gradually get tougher the further out you get. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After killing around three to four monsters you'll then Level Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, you'll need spend some of the money that you collect at the Inn to heal up, you know, after every so many battles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, for some reason, those demon enemies are actually not tough (though they look kind of scary). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... For some reason, the mushroom enemies are actually stronger. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] not really sure why that is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, by some weird coincidence, "Dragon Quest III" would also introduce mushroom enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, in this game, the mice are surprisingly hard, among the early enemies that you find. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Here, I've Leveled Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The options on the battle menu are your standard ones. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have attack, run, magic, and item. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One nice thing about this game is you're probably not going to get killed immediately after stepping out of the first village (something that a few the other games we've seen so far, you know, they seem to quite fun to doing). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The enemies are all [pretty] manageable. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Momotaro..." uses a password system to save... but you actually have to pay for it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That does seem a little crazy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, naturally, these are these huge long passwords. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, you may have noticed, uh, there's a 'Magic' option on the Menu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (It's the, uh, second from the top on the main status screen.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, so far, you have no magic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Dragon Quest" you don't obtain spells automatically while Leveling Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, you have to get it from these wise men you find your little huts. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the helpful old guys in "...Zelda", these dudes are actually [pretty] feisty, and you have to defeat them in combat in order for them to grant you your magic spell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (I'm fighting with this guy right here.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the first spell you obtain is (naturally) a 'Heal' spell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's quite useful for keeping your coins out of the hands of the innkeepers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, I've taken care of this guy, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once obtained, it works much like, uh, "Dragon Quest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You pull up the Menu on the overworld and it's under the 'Magic' heading - or you can use it during battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The next spell found is actually a, uh, powerful magic 'Attack' spell. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The art style is very similar to that of 'Dragon Quest' and the monsters are drawn in, sort of, the goofy Akira Toriyama style. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Note the tongue hanging out.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you're thinking, 'Hudson should really be ashamed for ripping off 'Dragon Quest' so blatantly.'... well, you have a point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, Momotaro's game designer and creator, Akira Sakuma, was also a veteran of Shounen Jump and he has worked with Toriyama. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And apparently he and 'Dragon Quest' creator, Yuji horii, are old college buddies and longtime colleagues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, this, sort of, might be considered to be, sort of, like a member of the gang working in a similar style, rather than an outsider ripping off another company's product. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we are in the next village; you'll want to buy some better weapons if you have the money. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [You] need to collect your animal friends (namely a dog, monkey, and pheasant). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This particular village has some sort of curse. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, as expected, you'll, uh, need to defeat the demon boss, lurking in the village. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, he's disguised as a human. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah, here we go. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sort of, like the first boss in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The production quality of the Hudson titles, sort of, varies, but "Momotaro..." is clearly a top-of-the-line game, technically speaking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The graphics and sound are top-notch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Take a look at little houses; they're so nicely detailed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have that great little animated thing of all the trees coming back to life after you defeated the villain. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's even little shadows behind the houses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Here the dog is going to, uh, join you as a companion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the animals don't actually act as party members in battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Momotaru..." is very much still in the style of "Dragon Quest (I)" (with one character versus one monster battles). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everything in this game is very nicely detailed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, when you go into the Weapon Shop, he has like swords lying around the shop. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not just like a generic counter with a guy behind it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The music is catchy and reflects the changing moods. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, in that village, when you first walk in the music is all spooky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you defeat the boss, then it becomes, sort of, like, the cheery typical music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, yeah, this game is a rather direct "Dragon Quest" clone, but it's very well done, it improves on a lot of "Dragon Quest" problems (there's no Nenu options to go up stairs, for example), and the overall is bigger, and the game looks a lot prettier. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, it's, like, a lot of enhancements were made to the "Dragon Quest" formula. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there weren't any moments that maybe want to throw my controller at the screen (which is more than I can say for a lot of other R.P.G.s on display this episode). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, if you want to see a "Dragon Quest" clone that does everything wrong... well, we have that coming up next. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hoshi no Miru Hito 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Another 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hot-B 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Finally, we've reached the end of our R.P.G. Blitz. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last (and definitely least, in terms of quality) is the rather infamous "Hoshi no Miru Hito". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite being a Japan-[only] title, this game has a certain amount of notoriety in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Right off the bat, notice your character moves unbelievably slowly (agonizingly slowly, as a matter of fact). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start right off next to the first town, but the town is not visible on the overWorld Map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Hoshi no Miru Hito" has a bad habit of making things invisible (be it towns, dungeons, or items) until you just happen to step right on 'em. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first town is [pretty] small (well, I guess actually they all are) but it has the Armor Shop, the Weapon Shop, and a nice lady who will heal you for free. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, unlike most R.P.G.s, you start with absolutely nothing (no weapons, armor, and not even one cent to your name) so you can't even buy anything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Out on the overworld, they have your standard random turn-based battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike every other R.P.G., the default Menu option is not 'Fight'; It's 'ESP' (Something you really won't use that frequently). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, make sure you use the D-Pad to select fight every single time you want to Attack. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The enemies found on the overworld, at the beginning of the game, are a real mixed bag. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of them are real pushovers and others are impossibly difficult. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the "Dragon Quest"-like Stat screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is also, sort of, problematic, but I guess I'll go back to that a little bit later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the tougher bosses are the Returners. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can find these things lurking basically right around the starting point of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there is one of the most blatantly stupid bugs I've ever seen any FamiCom game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Notice your Hit Points (listed near your character). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you take a look at the damage the enemy is doing, you'll notice the numbers don't quite seem to add up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's because the entire number is not displayed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 11 Hit Points is actually... (well) somewhere between 110 and 119. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, that's right, the last digit is actually cut off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is not an issue of this particular translation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's in the original version as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's utterly amazing this actually snuck by. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, these Returners are unfortunately quite common. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it's entirely possible that this could literally be your first battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Yet these guys are capable of dishing out, like, 48 damage with one attack, and you start out with 50 Hit Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, that is insanely unbalanced! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, oh yes, you can't actually run from battles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, should you actually manage to survive long enough to obtain a few Gold pieces, you can go and buy armor and weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, about the weapons... I bought the cheapest weapon and, uh, found it didn't really make any, sort of, difference, whatsoever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You have to buy *way* more expensive weapons, in order to make a noticeable increase in your Attack power. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, I guess some folks have claimed that the first weapon you buy actually *decreases* your Attack power. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is really hardly the full extent of the problems in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... There are so many, that it's really hard to even, sort of, document all of them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's another frequent enemy that cause you some trouble at first. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess he's supposed to be some kind of like, Stormtrooper or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, among the game's frequent and rather irritating problems, well, one of them, of course, is the N.P.C.s that refuse to move, no matter how long you wait. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I] can't really get past that girl because she's blocking the doorway. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And something that happens, um, way -- way too frequently is: you run to a very powerful monster, and ya attack it, whittle down its health (one point at a time, while sustaining lots of damage yourself) and you figure that - even though this one battle used up almost all your health, you at least will get a nice chunk of Experience and Gold when you defeat it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wrong! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] turns off before you kill it the enemy retreats, so you end up getting exactly zero Experience and Gold. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this happens over and over and over again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when in a town or dungeon, um, on the overworld often when you exit, for some reason, it will actually teleport you back to the beginning point of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems, as a rule, when you enter a door and then exit, you'll wind up someplace completely different. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, you can't really tell by looking at it, but "Hoshi no Miru Hito" is supposed to be a Science-Fiction-themed game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like various other Japanese games of this vintage, it focuses on psychic powers (or 'ESP', as they call it here). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a lot like games like "Esper Dream" or "Esper Bouken Tai" and "Spelunker II". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, this looks mostly like your typical R.P.G. with a fantasy setting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most of the backgrounds are so simple and ugly, they don't really look like anything. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Clearly, the title graphics here are some of the ugliest seen on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And check out this horrible brown, yellow, and green color scheme in this room. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Hoshi..." doesn't quite always make it clear what you're supposed to do. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, you are looking for a second character to add to your party. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, oh yeah, that hundred Gold there I found a second ago? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, completely invisible on the map; you just happen to step on the right tile. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, as a rule, there's a lot of invisible stuff on this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, unfortunately, new party members start off with (once again) no Gold, equipment, and you're at Level 0. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Incredibly, you can [only] see or access to stats and equipment of the front party member. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can switch them around all you want. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... And, as far as I can tell, this means that you cannot move items or Gold from one member to another. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, each new character has to acquire his own money to buy equipment, and old equipment can't be transferred to new party members. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, old equipment simply disappears when you buy new weapons or armor. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the positive side, "Hoshi..." does allow you to do something that "Dragon Quest" and "Magic of Herzog" did not allow you to do. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namely, you can choose to attack a specific enemy, rather than just a group of enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, after you tell your character what to do, he'll attack immediately afterwards, and then you'll select what you want the next character to do. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This prevents the problem found in "Dragon Quest" and "Final Fantasy" where, if you had selected a monster to attack that was now defeated, your character won't do anything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One weird thing is your character's so-called 'Jump' ability. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you obtain the, uh, 'Jump' magic, you can walk through walls and over some bodies of water. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is useful for accessing hidden areas, but seems a little weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why have all these walls and passageways in dungeons when you can suddenly walk right through everything? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, the graphic design is really quite a travesty. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, in this scene, where exactly are you supposed to be? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Are you inside or outside? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is that water surrounding us? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Absolutely no sense of atmosphere in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whereas most R.P.G.s gradually ramp up the strength of enemies you encounter, "Hoshi..." does not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The exact same imagery found everywhere in the main overworld. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They start out absurdly hard, but once you gain a few levels they become way too easy, making leveling, uh, incredibly boring and repetitive. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then when you move on to the next area (seen here), the city of Ark, the enemies are so much more powerful that your physical attacks literally cannot touch them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even with the best weapons, I could not do a single point of damage to any of the enemies, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your magic can kill them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is way too expensive, in terms of Magic Points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and, by the way, a nice little touch your characters age with experience, as reflected in your little character portraits. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I found the third party member. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Hoshi..." is a very weird little game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... In some ways it's more advanced than other FamiCom R.P.G.s. (like the way that you have a four-member party, and the ability to select individual enemies to attack, and the decent number of spells available, yet being so full of just completely amazing bugs and flaws the game is virtually unplayable). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can see why a cult following has flowered around the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It tries to be "Phantasy Star" but ends up being closer to "...Super Monkey Daibōken". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It really is a baffling and spectacular failure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game was published by Hot-B and developed by Another - the same two guys behind "The Black Bass" Fishing Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why they went from making a Fishing Game to making an R.P.G. is anyone's guess. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But apparently they were definitely not up to the task. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Karaoke Studio Senyou Cassette Hit Top 20 Vol. 1 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, we have to have a casual game from Bandai. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What would the FamiCom do without them? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our last game is "Karaoke Studio" Senyou Cassette Top 20 Vol. 1". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You remember the karaoke game Bandai released back in July? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, this appears to be a slightly altered re-release. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can't tell the difference really... other than a few added songs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than that, it seems to be [pretty] much identical. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are a few different karaoke modes, you sing using the special microphone accessory, and cute little animations play during the song, courtesy of developer Tose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sorry, [this is], sort of, a disappointing way to end the episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But after "Hoshi no Miru Hito", I guess anything would be anticlimactic. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 23 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so we survived the Japanese R.P.G. Blitz. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While I suppose it is [pretty] interesting to see all these early Japanese R.P.G.s, the fact is, the names behind these games are really not that impressive, for the most part (Hot-B, Kemco, Pony Canyon, ASCII, Random House). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose it would be a lot more interesting to see R.P.G.s from the likes of Nintendo, Konami, or Capcom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All in good time, I suppose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next time, 'Chrontendo' returns to normal. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Two Nintendo releases - including one huge one - one of Nintendo's biggest hits on the system - a title that every kid loved back in the day. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And to balance that out, we also have the debut of an American video game publisher whose name strikes fear into the hearts of N.E.S. owners, due to their consistently crappy titles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But we take the bad with the good. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, we'll see you next time. 🍇🍌
