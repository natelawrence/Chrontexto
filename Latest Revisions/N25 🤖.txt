👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 25 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we are at "Chrontendo ... 25". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We finally reached December of 1987 - an epic month with over 30 games released! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The craziness begins with two of the craziest movie games ever, "Star Wars" and "Rambo". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also: Konami madness! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Four Konami games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And a Dating Sim from Nintendo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's get rolling. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jikuu Yuten Debias 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Now Production 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So right out of the gate, we've got an Action-ish R.P.G. title from Namco, which has some sort of astronomical theme going on (as you can see by the symbols for the various celestial bodies on that mirror thing). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, take a look at the way this guy's mouth has been animated to make it look like he's talking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Make a mental note of how well it's done, so that later you can compare it something similar in another game this episode called Outlanders. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is "Jikuu Yuten Debias" (which means 'Spacetime Legend of Debias'... or something like that). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You get to choose your name and then... your schoolboy self is transformed into a mighty warrior, ready to battle evil. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, how do you fight evil in this game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, mostly by walking from left to right, hitting stuff with your sword, and collecting money and experience (exactly like you would expect). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, talk to everyone you come across. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, once you've spoken to someone, you can also kill them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is, sort of, like "Grand Theft Auto III" (except it's guys in robes, rather than prostitutes). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though you don't want to go around killing N.P.C.s, because that will lower your spirit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First, however, you're going to have to overcome the clunky interface which is [only] slightly improved from "Dragon Quest"'s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To talk to N.P.C.s, you have to hit, uh, Start and then select the 'Talk' option. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most other games of this time had figured out a way to let you interact with people without having to go through a menu. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now "Debias" has a day and night cycle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All the townspeople disappear at night and monsters come out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey, did they steal that from "Castlevania II"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [That] game was released in August and this was released in December, so it doesn't really seem possible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, the monsters come down out of the sky (like they were meteorites or something like that). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the monsters at night don't give you experience (or 'Tech', as they call it here). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, you can enter buildings and buy armor and weapons and talk to important people (like this guy right here, for example). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So far, everything in this game seems [pretty] typical of these sorts of side-scrolling Action R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy, here, is selling weapons, but... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Boy! There's pictures of them, but all those swords kind of look the same. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] not really sure what the difference is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, you need to talk to the King and his daughter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, R.P.G.s and games in related genres had this, like, weird obsession with royalty. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You always have to talk to a King at some point in Fantasy-themed games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, Japanese R.P.G.s would develop more surly and petulant heroes, who wouldn't take orders from some monarch. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, oh yeah! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game has some rather ugly art design in spots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's one really ugly color scheme! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The folks responsible for this were Now Production (same guys who developed "Spelunker II"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both "Spelunker II" and this game feel... a little off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But neither really quite qualify as kusoge. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Controls are a bit awkward too and the sequences where you, sort of, have to jump across platforms are a big pain. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Yeah, that worked real well.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And no, you don't have any lives or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One bad jump and you get a Game Over. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Though you can continue from the beginning of the level.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we've got some doors marked with symbols for Mercury and Jupiter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But what was with that, uh, middle door we saw a second ago? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Was that a -- a 6 on that? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What planet is that supposed to be? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, at any rate, are we getting, uh, tired of these games yet? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, the side-scrolling Hack-'n'-Slash with R.P.G. elements game - (I mean) it's becoming so ubiquitous that even, uh, '...Zelda' and 'Castlevania' kind of got sucked into the genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, really! How long are they kind of keep putting these things out? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The better ti... -- titles (like "Castlevania II" and "Faxanadu") are okay, but I'm feeling the genre is becoming a bit overexposed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Well, I guess in the future, we'll see how things go. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Trainer: Dalondoukai 🇯🇵 // Super Team Games 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November 27 🇯🇵 // 1988 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 // Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know what else I'm getting tired of? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Family Trainer games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is, what? Number seven? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That means there's [only] one more this year, then two more after that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Family Trainer: Daiundōkai" ('Great Athletic Meet'), or "Super Team Games", as was called in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For this release, Human and Bandai wisely stepped back from the last few high-concept 'Family Trainer' games, which tried to mix the Power Pad with traditional video game genres. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead, here we have a very simple sports theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You get on the Power Pad and run and jump. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are several different events. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Tournament is a race that involves various types of obstacles (you know, jumping over things) and actually, uh, pushing a ball with your stomach, for some reason. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Skateboarding has you skating around a little obstacle course. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can race against the computer opponent. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the big draw of "Super Team Games" is the Three Person option. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are events like the Six-Legged Race and Tug of War. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Super Team Games" is hardly a mind-blowing game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... But the rather straightforward controls and team options make it one of the more appealing Power Pad games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 BreakThru 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have a couple of U.S. releases from November to cover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First up: "BreakThru" from Data East. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose this might be an excellent illustration of Japanese video game companies' views of the market in the U.S. and Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "BreakThru" was never released in Japan and previously Data East had done a port of "Karate Champ" for the U.S.-[only]. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Meanwhile, in Japan they released, uh, "several gin Gucci" and "Hercules no Aiko". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is, rather simple Action Games for the Western market and more text-heavy Adventure Games and R.P.G.s in the East. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whether this was due to a perceived difference in the gamers' ages or preferences - or they just didn't want to invest any, uh, resources in making all-new games for the untested U.S. market, I don't know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At any rate, "BreakThru" was an Arcade Game (seen here). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The N.E.S. port is very similar to the Arcade version (right down to individual enemy placement). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It's] [pretty] clear what this game is all about: drive forward and shoot stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Buggy Popper", your vehicle can perform a little jump (necessary for avoid hitting rocks, falls, or falling off bridges). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The actual goal of the game is to make it through these five relatively short stages and take back your aircraft, which was stolen by enemy forces. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the game relies heavily on memorization. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, there are certain long jumps that require you to accelerate quite a bit prior to making the jump. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You, sort of, have to know where they are. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to step on the gas prior to the gap in the bridge actually becoming visible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise, you won't have enough speed to make it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the most part, levels aren't too different from each other. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 More enemies appear and the backgrounds change. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, you're passing through a city. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess a little collateral damage is expected when you're trying to get that that plane. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last level is actually, sort of, boring-looking; it's an airstrip. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "BreakThru" is not that difficult a game; you have infinite continues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while you can waste some time playing this thing, it's not really that great of a game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Top Gun 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 11 🇯🇵 // 1987 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Do you know how many Konami games there are this episode? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Four; that's right, four out of 15 games are from Konami. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, let's start with this one, "Top Gun". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, first of all, this is the most boring Konami intro ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least it gives you, sort of, like, a little animated shot of your jet getting ready to take off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, it actually does not show your jet taking off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It just shows your jet getting ready to take off. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Top Gun" is based on (or at least named after) the 1985 hit movie of the same name, starring Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, and Kelly McGillis. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game doesn't really take anything from the film beyond the general idea of flying around in a jet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No characters movie appear in the game and there's really no, sort of, plot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, "Top Gun" is a rather generic aircraft combat game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are four levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each has you encountering a set number of enemy aircraft and surface vehicles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have two weapons: your Guns and a limited number of Missiles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite the fancy looking control panel, "Top Gun" is definitely not an aircraft simulator. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It plays [pretty] much like "AfterBurner" (or maybe "Sky Destroyer" - that, uh, Taito FamiCom game from 1985). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The controls are [pretty] intuitive, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You use your D-Pad to, sort of, control the, uh, direction (or rather the, uh, angle) of your plane. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One button to fire the machine Guns, and another button to fire the Missiles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the controls do be a little bit trickier, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the one part that gave me a lot of trouble. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the end of each level, you need to land on the carrier. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, your speed at landing should be about 200 and the altitude should be about 288 (as it actually shows you on the display there underneath a little image of your ship). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But slowing down decreases your altitude. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The display will tell me to slow down, which, uh, while simultaneously telling me to go up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since the button to decrease your speed also lowers the plane, I could not figure out how that's actually possible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Failing to land correctly will cost you one life. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, that was real nice. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As the game progresses, you'll get tougher and faster enemies, including jets the fire missiles at ya. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These missiles will kill you in one hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So shooting or evading missiles is crucial. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll also encounter surface enemies, such as the ships on the water that shoot at you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And occasionally something like an enemy fighter will get behind you and you'll have to shake them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... I assume that "Top Gun" was designed for the U.S. market. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was released in the U.S. a month before Japan and bears a superficial similarity all the Air Combat Simulation Games released for U.S. computers (though, those games are always much more complicated than "Top Gun"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, Ocean Software released a, uh, Flight/Combat Simulator Game for the P.C., um, called "Top Gun", about the same time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Konami game, sort of, resembles that one but it's technically a different game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And something else to drive you crazy: refueling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When your fuel gets low, you have to call the refueling jet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game gives you all these crazy instructions to get lined up with the fuel dispenser arm. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like, Up, Left, Down, Up, Speed up, Left, Left, Up, Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know why they made this so complicated. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, "Top Gun" falls, sort of, in the middle of Flight Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not really as exciting as, like, a straightforward Action Game like "AfterBurner". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nor will it satisfy the technically-minded folks who like the Flight Simulators. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While there's really nothing wrong with "Top Gun", I just couldn't f... -- really find anything that exciting about it either. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 01 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're now in December and have another pioneering title this time from Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is also a deeply Japanese game and was never-released outside Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School" (or 'Nakayama Miho's Heartbeat High School') is the title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now who or what is Nakayama Miho? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, she was a popular Japanese idol (that is, a Pop singer and media figure in the 1980s). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's her on the game box art we saw a minute ago. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've seen video games based around Japanese celebrities before (Beat Kitano, for example, or the group Sukima II). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is the first game to feature a Pop idol. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It certainly won't be the last - not by a long shot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nope. Video games start going downhill from here on out, folks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, uh, video games based around girls, were already an established genre, when this came out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, "Tenshitachi no Gogo" from 1985 was one of the earliest so-called Dating Sims. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is, basically an Adventure Game based around getting girls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Bishōjo Games ('[Pretty] Girl' Games) were introduced to Japa... -- Japanese computers in the, uh, very early 1980s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One such title is "Lolita Syndrome" from Enix. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right; Enix made adult games back then (some, like this, with a rather, uh, disturbing misogynistic streak). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I wonder if, uh, Disney knows about this stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, of course, Nintendo is not going to venture into this, sort of, territory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a reason it's called the 'Family Computer'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this, you have your typical Japanese Adventure Game interface, and you need to interact with the -- the game's other characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One unique feature: 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game gives you phone numbers, occasionally, to call for hints and whatnot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy right here is, sort of, one of the main secondary characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You spend a lot of time in the game talking to him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, eventually, you'll end up running into Miho herself in the hallway. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... For some reason she's attending your High School in disguise, leading some sort of Hannah Montana double existence. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Will you be able to win her heart? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that's the main object of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Miho has dropped some sort of little teddy bear charm that ends up proving her true identity. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Man! She's got some really big eyes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So far, though, the game is mostly in the typical "Portopia" Adventure Game style. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there are some rather unusual moments (like this one coming up here, for example). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's rather naughty for a Nintendo game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At any rate, the game uses a, uh, dialogue tree system that's now standard in Dating Sims. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll be given different choices of things to say, which will either continue the storyline or lead you to a Game Over. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, the game is [pretty] generous. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Failing will simply let you restart the scene. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So who was behind this game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, Gunpei Yokoi, it seems, was involved. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... And the Music Composer was Nobuo Uematsu, of all people. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is another one of those F.D.S. games where you could fax in your results, in order to receive a special autographed VHS tape from Miho. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I've made her upset here, with something that I said. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the idea of interacting with a famous Japanese pop idol (and possibly engaging in some sort of imaginary romantic affair via video game) must have been [pretty] appealing to gamers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There would be plenty of other idol games and tons of Dating Sims. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting; one of the more popular was "Tokimeki High School" from Konami. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And perhaps the name was inspired by this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, the whole game is not just talking to Miho. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, you get kidnapped and taken to another girl's, uh, birthday party. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the Dating Sim has a [pretty] long and established history in Japan - both on consoles and computers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose a certain part of that success has to do with this game, itself. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Outlanders 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 04 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Micronics 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Victor Interactive 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 December shifts into high gear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Around half this episode's games were all released on the same day, December 4th. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's get started with "Outlanders" from Victor. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A rather basic title screen and, sort of, a texty intro let's you know this game isn't going to be anything special. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, if you saw the copyright info a moment ago, you'll guess this is based on existing IP. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Victor's games usually are. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, it's based on GOG manabi Sci-Fi manga. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is naturally a one-shot anime spin-off in 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The plot concerns an alien invasion of Earth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, the sexy alien Princess falls for the human protagonist. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Outlanders" has had some mature themes and the sex appeal of, uh, Princess Calm played a [pretty] big part in the comic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 She tends to wear very little clothing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So is Outlanders a sexy game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, no. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, what's going on here? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why are you moving your lips so fast? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This must be the worst attempt to sync up lip movements and speech in any video game ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, really, that's just obnoxious looking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You're playing as Waka Suki Tetsuya - an Earthling reporter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is a, sort of, a "...Zelda"-ish R.P.G. type game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, "Outlanders" was developed by Micronics, so yeah, it's a [pretty] terrible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I'll admit in this game I got off to a [pretty] rocky start, as I kept getting killed, uh, in the very first battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can take about three hits before you die. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then it's actually Game Over. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no lives or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, for an Action R.P.G., that's not very generous. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The key is to get the enemies lined up, so you can attack them both at once. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, if you end up getting surrounded, then it's [pretty] much all over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you have your typical, sort of, Action R.P.G. stuff here - a little treasure chest to open up (you know, that sort of silly stuff). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you get out on the main map, you'll see these enemies floating around, um, as well as the friendly folks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 (That's the Goal icon, there, I just touched.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, for some reason, everyone except you is represented by -- on the overworld by that weird icon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not even really sure what it's supposed to be. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It's] maybe a stylized person or maybe something from the manga? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's hard to say but it all kind of adds to ["Outlanders"'] overall feeling of incoherence. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why do you spend so much time walking around on this big empty overworld in your blue pajamas? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And where, exactly, are you even supposed to be? 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 A spaceship? 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 An alien world? 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Battles on the overworld can generally be avoided. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... But if you do hit a group of enemies, you can actually simply just walk off the screen... as demonstrated, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I hope you like this game this musical theme, because you'll be hearing it quite a lot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, eventually if you keep wandering around, you'll find what stands for a village in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which, in this case, is actually a bunch of guys standing around in some rooms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [There's] not exactly a whole lot of atmosphere in "Outlanders". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while I was here I bought a better sword. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But still, battles are a bit of a pain. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll always face multiple enemies which (as I mentioned earlier) tend to surround you - and it's [pretty] easy to get instantly killed in battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Action R.P.G.s have tended to have, sort of, problematic battle mechanics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Micronics', uh, special brand of awful makes "Outlanders" even worse than most. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I'd say this game definitely belongs on the bottom of this episode's trash pile. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Santa Claus no Takarabako 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 04 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Musical Plan 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Today's Weird Game Award goes to "Santa Claus no Takarabako". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This title from Data East must be the most useless thing we've seen for the FamiCom, so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's also the first 'seasonal' game we've seen for the system. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in the credits, we see the name Musical Plan (same guys who made those music programs, "Family Composer" and "Ikinari Musician"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can see the reasoning behind a music generation program, but... this is a virtual Christmas card generator. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 How it works is this: 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 You select the Christmas card option from the menu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You then type in your Christmas greeting - and you choose between three songs and backgrounds. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have your choice of Japanese or Roman characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably the most exciting thing in this game is the animated Santa. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a little Santa Claus that walks back and forth along the bottom of the screen when the message is displaying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can actually alter his appearance. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is actually [pretty] cool, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You could redraw him entirely and put whatever you want in, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, you [only] have those four colors. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, once you've got your card created, you then run it and see what it looks like. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can then save it to the disk and it'll start running whenever you pop it into the F.D.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what exactly was the purpose of this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Was this, like, literally supposed to be an electronic greeting card that you were supposed to, like, open up, create, and then give someone (like with a gift)? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If so, I certainly hope this is real cheap. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But that's not all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, when you think of Christmas, you also think of gambling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, the disk contains various party games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, these aren't actual games - but rather programs to assist you with playing a game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, Bingo simply generates random Bingo numbers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you wanted to play Bingo and you had Bingo cards but not one of those things with a number of balls that you spin around, you could use this instead. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, Roulette simply generates random Roulette selections. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also a Slot Machine that generates Slot Machine results. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I'm not really sure what this is for. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Poker Dice, uh, basically has you throwin' five dice and tells you the results. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, in theory, I suppose, you would break out this disk at a party or something and then do some gambling based on, you know, the results that it generates. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, the whole thing is, sort of, mystifying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, Poker Dice? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just rolling five dice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why not just get five dice and roll them? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't really need a FamiCom program to roll dice for you, do you? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, I'll stress: These aren't real games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, there's no way you can win or lose at them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're more or less just, sort of, like, random generators of some sort. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, the whole game is completely bizarre. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shanghai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 04 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Activision 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here's an interesting one from Sunsoft, "Shanghai" (the Mahjong tile Puzzle Game - the game you've probably encountered in some form already). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's really no, sort of, plot detail or anything - or even an opening animation, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, if you wait a bit, the credits will start rolling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] crazy music, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Shanghai" is a simple Puzzle Game of unknown and confusing provenance. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Computer Game version was created by one Brodie Lockard, originally for the mainframe PLATO computer system. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A commercial version was released by Activision for the Macintosh, in 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The name "Shanghai" originated with this version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It received various ports, including one from Hudson. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was actually a launch title for the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Does this looks familiar? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's because we actually saw the game briefly in "Chrontendo ... 24". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom version was released a few days after the P.C. Engine one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is one of those rare cases of a console getting a game before the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We actually saw this not that long ago with "hajia no foolin". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For a console game of this era, there are quite a few options. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can change the background music, you can select different tile layouts. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, the graphics take a [pretty] big hit in this version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of the characters on the [tiles] become almost, sort of, like, in comprehensible blobs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, more importantly, the tiles have been flattened down. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thus, the [tiles] have to be, sort of, color-coded to show the different levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, the game is actually quite addictive and playable. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object (in case you don't know) is to s... -- clear the screen of [tiles] by selecting a matching pair. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will remove them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, you can [only] select tiles that are free (meaning tiles along the edges, with no other tiles on top of them). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, one question arises as to where this game originally came from. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Activision (at least for a while) insisted it was an original idea - and thus they owned the rights to the concept. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, the original producer of the game said that Lockhard told him it was based on a Chinese children's game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, Activision's was definitely not the first version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, you keep up at it until basically you've cleared the entire screen of tiles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you get this little shot of a dragon here as a reward, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then the game will reset and you'll get another layout. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoever was responsible for porting this to the FamiCom - I suppose they did a good job. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it's [pretty] hard to screw up a game like this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know what I mean? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, I suppose that of all the versions we've seen (like the Macintosh, the various Computer versions, or [in Japan] the P.C. Engine version) this game wasn't quite as impressive looking. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Star Wars (Namco) 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Nick The Lounge Singer Sings Star Wars Theme" ♪ by Bill Murray

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 04 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Piccari Games 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 December 4th 1987 will forever be remembered as the day two totally crazy movie to video game adaptations were released. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sure, "Karate Kid" and "Jaws" were a little weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, compared to "Star Wars" and "Rambo", they look like models of fidelity to the source material. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namco went all out for the Star Wars game, even coming up with a special Namco logo and recreating the original movie's introduction. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, they were not able to, uh, get the text scrolling backwards into space. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the music is, uh, [pretty] passable. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, this sequence is quite impressive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is about as far as the game goes, trying to duplicate the movie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 From here on out, "Star Wars" (the video game) starts marching to its own drummer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game was never released in the West, though the N... -- the N.E.S. got a, uh, much later 'Star Wars' game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, uh, some gamers may not have played this version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much of the game's charm is the way it diverges from the movie's plot and completely breaks the 'Star Wars' canon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thus, playing it now is, sort of, like a new (but very nutty) take on a very familiar movie. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, luckily, there has been an unofficial translation released from Gil Galad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This allows us to fully appreciate "Star Wars"' strangeness. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, the plot involves Luke needing to travel to all ends of the galaxy to rescue Princess Leia's friends (though they all seem to know Luke as well). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Various familiar locations are seen (such as here) but [there] are some other odd ones as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, it starts getting weird when you enter the Jawa Sandcrawler and encounter... Darth Vader? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, instead, it's Scorpion Vader! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He appears to challenge you to a lightsaber duel, but when you hit him once, he transforms into a giant scorpion thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is how the boss battles typically go. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will fight a Vader doppelganger who transforms into some other form. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this, you then go on to rescue R2-D2, and he does a very little happy dance. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's funny, this is, sort of, like the first level on the Lego Star Wars. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In between the platforming levels, you have these little cockpit view space battle scenes - and they're actually [pretty] annoying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here Obi-Wan informs you he's being held on the planet Kessel, which is mentioned for [only] a second in the Star Wars movie, but I guess, sort of, figures into the later Star Wars books and whatnot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you have these Tie Fighters who are firing these green laser blasts at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you can't dodge 'em, you have to activate your shield. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The [only] problem is that she will last for about one second - and there's [only] three of them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if laser blast number four is headed your way, prepare to lose a life. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And oddly this level -- the Kessel level (it) has some sort of weird Egyptian theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can't make any sense out of it; that's just, sort of, the way the game is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here I found the blaster (which you can, uh, pick up occasionally). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This allows you to use ranged attacks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And those blue diamonds that you're always seeing, uh, those can use for power-ups (special Force powers, as we'll see). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the odd thing about "Star Wars" is... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Uh... Ooh! Look at that there! I'm standing in a wall.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Star Wars features a lot of what you would call, sort of, advanced platforming, for the time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Moving platforms, disappearing platforms, lots of spikes, all kinds of difficult jumps - it's curious how much parts of "Star Wars" r...emble -- resemble "Mega Man" (which would come out later in December). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's a bit of variety, like these light speeder sequences, which resemble, sort of, the skateboard in "Adventure Island", [only] faster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These parts are very memorization-based, because you have to be at the right speed in order to make the jumps. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in the style of "Super Mario Bros." and "Alex Kidd", there's, of course, an underwater level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally you fight Darth Vader underwater, and he turns into a shark. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So back to the plotline. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, you encounter the Death Star. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, once inside, you'll find that it's huge and maze-like. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's very easy to get lost in the damn thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But eventually, you'll hopefully find Princess Leia's cell and then end up in the trash compactor. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, throughout the game, you've been rescuing your buddies, and at times you'll need to get some assistance from them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, when you're stuck in the trash compactor, you will need to select R2-D2 in order to open the door. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This, sort of, makes sense, but most of other times, this is employed in a completely arbitrary fashion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh oh! Looks like I'm doomed! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I'll select R2-D2 from the crew menu. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also very helpful (and perhaps even necessary to complete certain parts of the game) are the Force powers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, here I need to use Levitation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I can't seem quite get up to that ladder, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also, uh, Force powers that'll increase your speed, you can become temporarily invulnerable, shoot lasers from your lightsaber, and, uh, so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll come across the real Darth Vader. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess Obi-Wan couldn't make it to this particular fight. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing about "Star Wars" is, it's actually tough (I mean really tough!) in spots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, uh, "Mega Man"-style tough! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, uh, you often find, like, these kind of crazy jumping sequences here (like having to jump those spikes, for example) that requires a [pretty] precise jump. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, now here, I'm stuck. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, C-3PO will talk to the whale; anyone could have figured that out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoa! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, that was just wrong! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you rewind that and check it out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, both feet were clearly on the whale. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game's hit detection is not very generous. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can sometimes go right through the edges of certain platforms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are plenty of times when you can clearly see your lightsaber hit an opponent and nothing happens. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we have the, uh, ice level, which is slowly becoming, sort of, ubiquitous in video games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's described as the ice world of Tina. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, no; it's not Hoth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this can get [pretty] hairy, at times, with all the blocks that disintegrate as soon as you land on 'em. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And these randomly-moving platforms can also be a pain. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And naturally, at the end of this you will fight Vader Wampa! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, that's right; Darth Vader actually turns into a wampa. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of the boss fights can actually be [pretty] tough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and here's another jump to drive you completely insane. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to activate your 'Speed' power, in order to make this completely blind jump, followed by, uh, two very other precise jumps, right afterwards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That grey stuff will kill you if you land in it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last level is the moon of Yavin. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it looks, sort of, like the Empire's already, kind of, taken over the Rebel base, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you have one last battle with Darth Vader. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All the bosses, sort of, use, like, a particular attack pattern, uh, that you have to learn, in order to defeat them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, one thing about this is that, unlike "Castlevania", or "Mega Man" is one hit and you're dead! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, by the way, I'm playing the game on the 'Easy' setting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The 'Hard' setting has way more enemies, and I'm really not going to subject myself to that for this video. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, here we are for the exciting finale! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You race down the trenches of the Death Star in a timed segment. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can pick up those little 'T's, which will, uh, give you a little bit of extra time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also speed up or slow down. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there are a lot of unexpected turns and some dead ends. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So again, some memorization will be required. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then, uh... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess I should put in a spoiler alert, in case someone out there doesn't know who -- how "Star Wars" ends. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In case you've just, sort of, been meaning to see the movie after all these years, but haven't gotten around to it yet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise, well, you, uh, blow up the Death Star. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hurray! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, as the game ends, you kill Darth Vader; and Luke, Han, and Leia and Obi-Wan all live happily ever after, just like in the movie! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, there you have it - the infamous Namco "Star Wars". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the weird thing is, despite the, uh, huge and bizarre liberties it takes with the movie, the game is, sort of, impressive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was [pretty] long and offers quite a bit of variety (and eerily resembles "Mega Man" in many ways). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, the production values can't quite hide the fact that, at times, this game just, sort of, seems kind of wrong. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, I'd count "Star Wars" as one of the most provocative games this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Playing it can be a bit of a bitch, however. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Chewbacca looks very odd in this closing sequence, for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually, all the characters look a little weird in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, during the game itself, Luke has dark hair. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I'd recommend giving the game a try, though prepare to die quite frequently. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dragon Scroll: Yomigaerishi Maryuu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 04 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, here's the Konami game that I think most folks will be interested in, "Dragon Scroll: Yomigaerishi Ma Ryū". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The subtitle means something like 'resurrection of the dragon demon'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game has, sort of, a 'good dragon versus bad dragon' theme. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, we got a fantastic intro with some great music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some mystic books were stolen, causing an evil dragon to be awakened. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you (the Gold dragon) also awaken and transform yourself into a human being in order to, sort of, sort things out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami's intros and title sequences are [pretty] much almost always top-notch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Scroll" has a lot of text But we do have this unofficial translation from King Mike to make things a little bit understandable for us. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, Konami has done quite a few top-down Action Adventure Games, but "Dragon Scroll" is definitely the most "...Zelda"-like of all their games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might even want to place it in the category of a "...Zelda" clone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But hey, it's a really good-looking "...Zelda" clone. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, it's been almost two years and still it was released in the games now have a lot more dialogue But there's quite a bit of backstory filled in for you throughout the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Somebody sent me a kill folks, they start talking to you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your objective is to wander the earth, find the missing books and other miscellaneous objects, and crack down the Chrome Dragon freedom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a total of five different worlds; each page has a couple towers or dungeons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are work points here and there to transport you to the other worlds. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Scroll" is almost completely nonlinear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's not really too long if you know what you're doing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, figuring out what you're doing is definitely the hard part. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Safra is one of the guys you're looking for. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Turns out that that's not him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Scroll" can probably be considered to be an R.P.G. through the fact received experience from killing enemies and you do gain levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's about it for the traditional R.P.G. trappings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no money or shops or ends or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess there are treasure chests. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There aren't any potions or anything. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is magic, but it doesn't quite work like inspect. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fuel occasionally find a life refill or a magic refill But there aren't that many you can't really count on it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now of course, there are, sort of, many important items that are very well hidden (even more so than in "...Zelda"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, there's one coming up here where you have to stand between these two stone heads for a moment. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then after a little while a chest will appear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is, by the way, the silver ring; this allows you to move a little bit faster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also another ring that kind of cuts down on your damage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Among the other oddities, there's a hidden coin flip game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now a lot of games in the mid-1980s have a "...Zelda"-like tendency to hide important items, though "Dragon Scroll" tends to hide things in a, sort of, excessively obscure fashion at times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, they're often found in those stone heads, but you'd normally have to use magic to find them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the limited number of Magic Points so it makes it a bit more difficult. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On there, sort of, a reoccurring Konami enemy right there the skeleton that comes back to life a moment after you kill them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here you need to use the magical berries in order to find them necklace which is hidden in one particular statue. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the necklace is another magical item used to make you temporarily invulnerable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, before you can do any of this you have to find the berries. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And to find the berries indeed find something called the Rain Bell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now probably the the worst moment in all of this is when a new to use the Rain Bell and the various to find this hidden tower. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, you've got to use the Rain Bell, which doesn't really seem to reveal anything, but actually causes an invisible door to appear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He then use the berries on the invisible door. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Granted, that ring stones looks suspicious but I mean come on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it's an invisible door how you supposed to know what's, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bottom line is you will probably either need a walkthrough or have a whole lot of time on your hands or to get through this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully the original Japanese manual gave players some tips for something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another irritation: The projectiles you shoot will sometimes go right through enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This happens a lot on the mummies It seems the first shot hits and then the second shot passes right through. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can see this again, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other times both shot is hit, I didn't really knows why. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, as I mentioned, you'll spend a lot your time looking around for various items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll, for example, in a key to open the lock doors, various, sort of, special use objects, and something called the modern staff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the most powerful weapon in the game and once you've got it, you'll be strong enough to take on more powerful, amazing bosses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are three sub-bosses and one Final boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On this particular guy, you need to use the rain belt to make invisible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The monster they will admit are all unique looking, but definitely not the most impressive bosses Konami has given us so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you defeat them, you'll get a magical book. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the other books have to be taken back from the thieves which are, sort of, wandering around the world somewhere or some of them are actually found in chests. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And once you've found, sort of, all the books, the final level consists of climb a mountain with a castle on top. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here, I've just defeated one The second box, right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will allow me to get the so-called book of the earth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe it was these magical books actually caused the Chrome Dragon to come back to life to begin with. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the final and toughest level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (1 there's the thief who has one of the missing books.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He climbed way through the castle to base the Final boss, and... well, I guess not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I must have missed a book somewhere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But once you finally got all the books, you will then climb to the top of the castle, turn into dragon form, and then fight the Chrome Dragon, but it actually is a [pretty] cool ending. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite the kind of cool boss battle, I found dragons will be a bit disappointing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the idea of Konami does "...Zelda" sounds great on paper, and the game looks very nice (much better looking "...Zelda", of course). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But too much the game just, sort of, seems like why Going around looking for various items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the magic items are mostly, sort of, like passive use or, sort of, specialized use items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no offensive magic, for example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than two weapons upgrades, nothing you find really seems that cool. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (I mean, how cool is something called the rainville or the silence Bell or something like that.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And despite all the dialogue, the game doesn't really have much plot or any, sort of, narrative thrust. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's cool that Kami made an attempt to be make a very nonlinear game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But as a result, the game seems [pretty] formless. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I wish the game had more character - like gets through modern or "Metal Gear", still with the recently worthy effort and I guess worth checking out this this, sort of, thing that you like. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Doremikko 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 04 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami game number three, but this is a bit different than "Dragon Scroll". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it's another Virtual Synthesizer game, "Doremikko". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's also frequently called DreamMikko, but this name doesn't really make any sense to me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not exactly sure what 'Doremikko' is supposed to mean. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I mean, the 'Do Re Mi' part is obvious, but not the 'kko'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The feature that sets "Doremikko" apart from the other music titles is that it came with a special keyboard controller (as you saw on the box cover a minute ago). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You play simply by tapping the keys on the controller - as opposed to the more complicated methods of making music required by something like "Family Composer". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally you have a variety of different sounds available. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also recording studio type setup. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This being for the disc system, you can actually save your masterpieces. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are a couple additional modes as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can have a four piece band play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And naturally you can choose all sorts of crazy instrumentation and various preset rhythms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Here's the vibraphone, for example.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, the end instruments don't exactly sound lifelike, but it is cool to kind of play around with the different sounds. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Finally, there's also a solo keyboard mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a rather geeky looking guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... But really (just like every other, sort of, similar FamiCom title) this is interesting, but it's not really a game, per se. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Rambo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pack-in-Video 🇯🇵 // Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we see the magic words: 'Pack in Video' and 'Acclaim'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This looks like a [pretty] boring title screen until... Ooh! What's that? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's Rambo! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] small logo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game might be familiar to old-time N.E.S. players. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I'm sure you're aware, it's based on the hit movie with Sylvester Stallone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've already seen a 'Rambo' game on the Master System. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So along with 'Rocky', this makes Stallone the King of 8-bit movie tie-in games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is all very cool, but check out this Japanese intro. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What is that about? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also the colors on the Japanese version are a little weird as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, Trautman wants you to head to Vietnam on a secret mission. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's, sort of, like the Princess in "Dragon Quest"; he won't take no for an answer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I wonder if "Rambo" (the video game) was possibly influenced by "Metal Gear", which had come out on the M.S.X. earlier this year. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All these mission briefing dialogue things remind me a lot of that game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what is interesting is that Rambo has this introductory sequence where you need to, sort of, talk to everyone, in order to get the details of your mission. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the kind of thing seen most R.P.G.s but here it's been transposed onto an Action Platformer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the name of this game's developer and Japanese publisher, Pack in Video, will undoubtedly be familiar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But who exactly were they? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, Pack In... had actually been around for quite a while, since 1970, in connection with Victor and the Tokyo Broadcasting System. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They mostly did video sales and distribution. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the 1980s they decided to get into the video game field. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually Pack in Video's video game division was split from the video sales division. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in 1986 Pack In... became Victor Interactive Software. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then, more recently, uh, the controlling interest was obtained by Marvelous Entertainment and name was changed again to Marvelauy Marvelauy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Pack In... developed and published plenty of games perhaps the most well-known being 'Harvest Moon'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is not the first Rambo game from Pack In. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Presumably they obtain the rights for the video games due to the video distribution division. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rambo for the M.S.X. bears a weird resemblance to "Hydlide". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It has the same walk into enemies to kill the mechanic (though Rambo's knife looks kind of like a cigar). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The clumsily named "Super Rambo Special" for the M.S.X. 2 was released the next year. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a completely different game, but has a very similar idea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the items in Rambo's inventory is a rose? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah and Rambo lets out this blood-curdling scream when killed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The N.E.S. "Rambo" was the final Pack In... game based on the movie. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, as you see here, your sprite looks very little like Sylvester Stallone, um, unlike in Sega's game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, you seem to be wearing red hoodie pajama bottoms, which are completely inappropriate for a jungle outing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here's Rambo in the jungle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is he battling enemy soldiers? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nope. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wild animals. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I've mentioned before the weird habit of video game designers pitting you against enemies that are not very threatening in real life. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But here... bees? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, look at that! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's -- That's obviously a bee! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, seriously, Rambo is this super soldier killing machine and he's fighting bees!? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, tigers - that I can understand! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So your main weapon is this knife with a range of about two pixels or so. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily have a decent size Life Bar and several ranged secondary weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These tend to be very, uh, weak or limited in quantity. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You actually do get Experience Points that will allow you to, sort of, uh, Level Up your weapon a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, of course, Rambo is finding the time to do a flirting with Co. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, why is rebel wearing a green shirt here but is clearly shirtless in the side-scrolling sequences? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, as anyone who's played this game has realized, Co jumps when you do, so you can get Rambo and Co to do, like, a little dance party out there in the jungle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At various moments, some character interactions will replay your health (like here, for example). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The game's, sort of, overall...-arching goals are that you need to find a P.O.W., get him to a helicopter, then find another helicopter, then find a second P.O.W., and then escape. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there is this optional quest to rescue a missing boy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, despite this taking place in Vietnam, none of the characters in this game really seen Asian. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the whole 'rescue the boy' part of "Rambo" seems almost like was taken from another game entirely. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Suddenly, you're out there fighting and things like these weird Flying Skeleton Heads. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you'll enter a cave and rescue the boy from a Giant Spider. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... I suppose is entirely possible this section was added into length in the game or maybe simply reused from the unfinished game, since it really makes no sense in the context of the rest of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I should mention that it can be somewhat difficult to find your way around in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's set up much like "Valis" with a series of side-scrolling screens that are connected certain points that allow you to move either North or South (will actually say 'N' or 'S' on them). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While "Rambo"'s world is not exactly enormous, It can be tricky to find your way around due to the fact that some areas look very similar and can be connected in very odd ways. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, here, we're back in the 'real' game plot, here; I found a P.O.W. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Surprisingly, the -- the game actually gives you a few options. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Video games have, sort of, been, uh, starting to experiment with the 'good ending/bad ending' thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And "Rambo" does give you a few choices, such as not wrestling the POWs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, after this, the game starts to get even more nutty. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are numerous highlights of Rambo, so let's, sort of, take a look. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this point I was getting a bit pissed-off at the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I just put on an invincibility password that prevents you from dying when your health reaches 0, but the screen flash a lot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And look at this! They started dropping bombs on me! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and here's the big plot twist. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like the movie Rambo gets captured. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now you need to play as Co and rescue Rambo by wearing a slinky dress and infiltrating the camp. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, some changes have been made to make this game a bit more G rated. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah. Here it looks like I'm stuck, but... wait a second! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess I forgot about the miraculous powers of John Rambo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now eventually, of course, Co will die. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rambo looks [pretty] broken up, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this was 10 years before "Final Fantasy VII"! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are so many oddities in this game (like this boss's head)! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ugh/Ew! What is going on with that guy? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually you will face the Final boss, which is this enormous helicopter that can be displayed [only] with grenades (a whole lot of grenades)! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, there's a constant barrage of bombs and enemy soldiers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The fight is [pretty] tough and takes way too long. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Rambo" also has one of the oddest denouements in videogame history. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the end, you go back and face Murdoch (just like in the movie) but... you can fire a giant kanji character that reads 'Ikari'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that will turn him into... a frog! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Say what? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what exactly prompted designers to give Rambo that horrible facial expression when he's yelling? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually all the Rambo portraits are [pretty] awful-looking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Rambo" is definitely not a [pretty]-looking game and it can be irritating! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are a number of moments in the game that sort of run the full range from decent, to wacky, to just plain idiotic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game has been classified as Metroidvania title and there is, sort of, a semi-R.P.G.ish Experience system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the whole thing feels kind of half-baked. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I prefer the simple knife stabbing action of "Green Beret", myself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Rambo" lacks that game's smooth handling and has just too many rough edges. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But is nonetheless a [pretty] interesting game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 JJ: Tobidase Daisakusen Part 2 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 07 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Square 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Square 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, folks, "Chrontendo ... 25" We'll be coming in for a landing soon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But we've still got a few minor games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 From Square, it's "JJ: Tobidase Daisakusen Part 2", which is (guess what?) the sequel to "JJ: Tobidase Daisakusen (I)". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That game was released in the U.S. by Acclaim as "3D WorldRunner" but "JJ..." never left Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, "JJ..." looks a lot like the first game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 JJ's sprite has been redrawn, there are some new backgrounds, but the planetary, uh, surface checkerboard is still [pretty] much the same. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the graphics have been given a bit of an upgrade. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As before, you run into pillars to get power-ups (or power downs that can kill you). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One difference this game is faster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 JJ is always running at full speed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The result is a bit more frantic than the first game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing I do like: When you pause the game, JJ is cool enough to turn around completely and face the camera while kneeling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Looks like he's taking a smoke break or something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or maybe he's just out of breath from running so hard. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For those of you who remember the "Chrontendo Episode..." covering the first game, you'll know I pointed out the other obvious similarity to "Space Harrier". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's true here as well; the bosses all look very much like dragons from Sega's game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "JJ" also still has a 3D mode, which is activated by hitting the Select button. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This may be a bit harder than the original. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game speed might have something to do with it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Level 2 starts ya off with some rather tricky jumps. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are, sort of, trial and error, memory-based things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you didn't start your job at exactly the right spot, and you're ending about to fall into a pit, there's really not much you can do about it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are some rather obnoxious enemies that appear in the second level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They actual, sort of, grab on to you and block you from moving forward. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there is nothing wrong with this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 ([It's] [pretty] impressive technically!). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, obviously this would not be the, sort of, game that Square would focus on in the future. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "JJ" is actually in the final pre-"Final Fantasy" release from Square. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, big changes for the company are on the way. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Exciting Baseball 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 08 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our fourth and final Konami game this episode, and it's a bit disappointing: "Exciting Baseball" - the third game in Konami's 'Exciting Sports' series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A series of Sports Games seems to be virtually a requIrement for publishers, at this point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have Nintendo's generically titled Sports Games, Namco's 'Family Sports' series, Sega's 'Great Sports' series (for the Sega Master System), and, of course, these games here from Konami. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, first of all, let me complain about just one thing: for a Konami game, this is [pretty] boring-looking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, look at this; this is cheap and ugly! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami had so many great-looking games at this time, I was really hoping they would make an impressive-looking Baseball Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But nope! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose the, uh, the batter and pitcher in this game are reasonably well drawn. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But right off the bat, you can tell this is not really a product of Konami's A team. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So how does it play? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's, sort of, like every other Baseball Game in the system, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can swing high, low, or in the middle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I never really got the hang of batting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] seems harder than it should be hit the ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I] got a lot of strikes and wasn't always sure why. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The fact that the floating catcher's mitt, sort of, obscures the view of the ball I'm sure doesn't help. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, when playing against the computer, the other team will almost always hit the ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The computer gets a lot of good hits in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Fielding is very similar to every other 8-bit Baseball Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You use the D-Pad to throw it, uh, to the base of your choice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, the zoomed in view of the field makes it kind of difficult to get to the ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you can't always see your outfielders positions the entire time or while the ball is in the air. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not being able to see exactly where outfielders are makes it kind of tough to put them into position. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Good example, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you have a few different pitches and quite a bit of control over the ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It doesn't really seem to matter when playing the computer, because they can hit even your best pitches. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The previous release in this series was "Exciting Basket" or "Double Dribble". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It's] too bad this couldn't be more like that game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Exciting Baseball" was (as far as I can tell) not based on [an] Arcade Game, but was rather an original title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, take a look at this, right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No way was that a hit! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there are some interesting options on this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Being an F.D.S. game, you can save your team's progress, and they're, sort of, extensive customization options for your team. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some ideas were a bit ahead of its time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, you can trade team members with someone else who has the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They have to put their disk into the machine and it'll make a note of the swap and, uh, write over the save files. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, despite the wide variety of options for the game, "Exciting Baseball" is [pretty] subpar and not as fun as, say, "Bases Loaded". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the music is strikingly bad! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With the constant blowing of whistles will start to seriously grate on your nerves very quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, I'm not completely unconvinced my bad performance at this game wasn't at least partly due to that constant shrieking whistle sound. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, all in all, "Exciting Baseball" is a real disappointment. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Golf Club: Birdie Rush 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 09 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Out of all the Sports genres, Golf and Baseball are currently dominating the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 ([That's] not surprising, since both Baseball and Golf are very popular in Japan). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here's another Golf Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our final game this episode is "Golf Club birdie rush" from Data East. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here you have the typical options, including, uh... 'Stork Game'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The basic gameplay of "...Birdie Rush" should be familiar to anyone who's played the other FamiCom in Golf Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 D-Pad lets you select your club, though the best choice usually seems to be automatically selected for ya. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will then need to select the angle at which you hit the ball. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the observant among you will note: There is no on screen overview of the hole you're playing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In order to see where you're supposed to be hitting the ball, you hit Select and then you can move the camera around and view the grounds to your heart's content. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll notice the, uh, display is actually [pretty] minimal! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they've done away with various little windows containing information found in so many of Nintendo's Golf Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows if this was some sort of forward-thinking decision on Data East's part. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe they were trying to reduce visual clutter found in typical Golf Games, or maybe they were just lazy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The swing mechanism is very simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You hit the button once to start the swing - and again to complete it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a power gauge, but you don't really have to time the button presses exactly (like in the Nintendo games). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you don't really have to worry about opening or slicing the swing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there are times when the never-changing overhead viewpoint can become a little frustrating. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... One of them, for example, is, like, right here, when you're on the green. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm lining up taking my shot, but I can't see the hole! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to move the camera to get a glimpse. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you'll still have to line up your shop blindly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the slope of the green is a little confusing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I assume those arrows in the little black box are supposed to indicate the slope. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But they don't really seem to jive with where the ball goes when he hit it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This makes putting kind of tough, but I did end up getting a very lucky shot, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, all the courses in this game seem to be, sort of, these absurdly long, vertically oriented fairways (didn't really see much variety when I was playing this game). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the presentation is a little on the dull side. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Birdie Rush" is very green. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It does for green what "Faxanadu" did for brown. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the courses are... (well, they're) sort of spartan and empty-looking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now "Birdie Rush" was not an Arcade port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there was an Arcade version with a not quite as optimistic title, "Birdie Try". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was released in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade Game was characterized by a more standard Golf Game display with a little on-screen map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Data East decided to, sort of, spice up the visual side of things by adding see, sort of, very low-flying clouds, drifting over the courses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Birdie Rush" seems like a solid Golf Game, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's [pretty] easy! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was getting all kind of birdies the first time I played it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess it is, sort of, a fun 'pick up and play' kind of game. 🍇🍌
