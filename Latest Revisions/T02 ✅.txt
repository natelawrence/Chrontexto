👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chronturbo Episode 2 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 Why, *hello* there! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [didn't] think I'd given up on '*Chronturbo*' now, *did [ya]*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Not] a *chance*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Chronturbo* Episode <One::1>" began with the system's *launch* in October <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Seven*::*1987*>, up through July <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Eight*::*1988*>. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *this episode'll* cover the *rest* of <Nineteen-[Eighty]-Eight::1988> - *<thirteen::13> games* altogether. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As [before, *most*] games [are published] by *Hudson* in *Japan* (with Namco chipping [in] a *bit*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *four new [publishers* will] be [introduced this episode]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] they're *[not] really* the usual [*suspects*] - no [Konami or] *Capcom* yet (though we *do [have] a [port]* of a Capcom *Arcade* game). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *let's start* in [August] <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Eight*::[*1988*]>. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pro Tennis: World Court 🇯🇵 // World Court Tennis 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 11 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 First [out] the [gate], this *episode*, is *Namco* with their fourth P.C. Engine *game, "Pro Tennis*: World Court". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just as] "Pro Yakyuu World *Stadium*" was a souped-up version of FamiCom's "*Family* Stadium", *so is* "Pro *Tennis*..." a souped-up version of "*Family* Tennis". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *It even has* [that] typical *rainbow logo* [that we've] seen on the [*title*] screens [of] so many of their *FamiCom* games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *There [are]* options [for] up [to] four *players* [and] you [can] choose [your] *character from* a variety of players, based on real tennis *pros*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Naturally*, N.E.C. released this in the *U.S.* as "World Court *Tennis*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *It turns out* [to] be a [*pretty*] darn good *Tennis* Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I liked [it better than] "*Family* Tennis". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Graphically*, the game is nothing *special*, [but it] does *handle* [surprisingly] *well*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] C.P.U. [opponents are *pretty*] fast [and] *normally* [don't] make many unforced *errors*, [so] you'll *hafta* try [to] force errors *upon* them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Pressing the D-Pad [while swinging] the *racket* [will control] the direction of [your] *shot*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, you [can often get in] a good [shot into your opponent's opposite] *corner*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So far*, this is [*pretty*] typical [for] a *Tennis* Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *here's* where [it gets] *weird*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On [the] *main menu*, there's a '*Quest*' option. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 What [does *that] do*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, ya -- first of all, ya [hafta select] a name [and] *gender*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *then you'll find* yourself *dragged* into an [*utterly ridiculous*] R.P.G.-inspired single-person *campaign*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] seems some evil *tennis* players [have] taken over the Tennis *Kingdom*, [and] the King of *Tennis* [wants] you [to] clear the whole mess *up* (which he [refers] to as a '*favor*'). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*One thing]* we've [noticed] in '*Chrontendo*' is [that throughout] <Nineteen-[Eighty]-Seven::[1987]> and <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Eight*::[*1988*]> R.P.G. elements have been [*introduced* into] *every* [conceivable] *genre* ([Platformers], Racing Games, [Shoot]-'em-Ups, ya *name* [it]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *still, "Pro Tennis*..." is [surprisingly] *brazen* in the way [that it *inserts] Tennis* Games into a 'Dragon Quest'-style R.P.G. *world*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, the King gives ya some cash, which [we'll] need [to] buy [*equipment* (better] *rackets* [and] shoes [and] *shirts*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Walk around *town* [and] various N.P.C.s [will] give ya [little] bits of unhelpful *advice*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Most [hilariously]*, one guy [identifies the] *village* [that] you [start] *off* [in] as *Chicago*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, the *whole thing* is done [in] a [pretty] tongue-in-cheek fashion. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Out] on* the [*overworld*, you'll encounter] *other tennis* players {and} be challenged [to] *matches*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] *try* [to] *refuse*, [but unless] you have expensive *shirts*, [you'll] be forced [to] *play*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *losing* a [<~g...ame~::game> will send] ya back [to the] King who [will] *resurrect* you [and] give you a [*bit*] more *money*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [it] *turns out* "Pro Tennis..." [isn't] really an *R.P.G.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [don't] have any *stats*, [Experience] *Points*, [and] *never* gain any magic [or] special *moves*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Better equipment] does make ya hit the *ball* harder [and] *run faster*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *really*, the whole [*'Quest'*] thing is [just, sort] of, a clever way [to introduce] a single-player *campaign* [into] the *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Later*] you'll find helpful [*items* and] be able [to] travel [to] new [*cities*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The <~inter-[tube]~::[innertube]> allows [ya to] cross [bodies] of [*water*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you'll need [it to get] a special [item] that'll help [ya fight the] final *boss*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll also need [to collect] *pearls*, which [are found] by [defeating] bosses [that're] holed up [in] various locations around the *overworld*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, yeah, sure*, uh, this is [pretty] *silly*, but [it] *really* is [quite] *surprising* [to] see something [like] this [in a] *Sports* Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, while] the execution is [hardly] *perfect*, [I'm] glad Namco [decided to, sorta], switch up the Tennis Game *formula* [a little] bit. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru 🇯🇵 // Keith Courage in Alpha Zones 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 August 30 🇯🇵 // 1989 August 29 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If there's *one* <Turbo-Graphics::TurboGrafx> game that'll live [in] infamy [*forever*], it's *this* one, "*Mashin* Eiyuuden Wataru*" by *Hudson*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *title* [can] mean either '*Devil* Hero Wataru' or '*Machine* Hero Wataru'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *On one* [hand, this is a typical licensed] *game* - [not that different] from "*Bikkuriman* World", [*except* that it] was [released] in the *U.S.* by *N.E.C.* in <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Nine*::*1989*> under the name "Keith *Courage* in *Alpha* Zones". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Furthermore*, [it] was the *pack*-in game for the <Turbo-Graphics-Sixteen::TurboGrafx-16>, thus making [it] *one* of the most well-known [*titles* for] the *console* (at least [in the United] *States*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *original* version was based on [an animated] *series* [that] ran from <Nineteen-[Eighty]-Eight::[1988> to <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Nine*::*1989*]> by the well-[respected] animation studio, *Sunrise*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *The game* [simply] concerned a young kid [who] found [himself] warped into a weird [magical] world [that] was, *[sort of], video game*-[inspired], as [he had to] make [his] way through a *pyramid* [with multiple themed] *levels*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The series t... -- is [still fondly remembered *today] even* though [it] looks [kinda] *creepy* [to] *me* (the way everyone has [that] weird [vacant] *look* on their faces [and] their *mouths* [hanging] open all the time). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the [*story*] was [completely] altered [for] the *U.S. version*, though *none [of the] characters* were. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Supposedly*, in the U.S. version, this takes place on *Earth* after [an] alien *invasion* (though you would never *know* [that, strictly from] playing the *game*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A [promotional *comic*] book was [created] to explain the *backstory*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "*Keith Courage..." [greatly] resembles* "Wonder Boy [in] *Monster* Land". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya kill *monsters*, collect *money*, buy [*items* from the] guys [in the] *shops*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] also buy *healing* or special *weapons*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's weapon, actually *singular*; [it's just] *one* called 'the [*bolt*] bombs'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] *the *end of* each surface* level, ya ride a *rainbow* to the [underground] *section*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] you [are] *now* suddenly equipped in a *mech*, which [can] move much *faster* [than your] *human* form. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([That's actually] a [pretty] cool [transformation] sequence [there].) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *[While] down* here [ya can] fire off [your *bolt*] bombs (*which [are* just little *projectiles*]; they [aren't quite as] impressive [as] the name *sounds*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing* I do love is the *enemies* [that are] shaped like *handguns*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *watching* this video [should] give you a [*pretty*] good idea [of] how the game *operates*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Your *health* is measured in these suspiciously "...Zelda"-like *hearts*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When ya lose all three *hearts*, the game is *over*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, *thankfully*, you [can] take a [lot] of [*hits* before ya] lose a *heart* (which is a *good thing* because you *really* can't [completely] avoid *enemies*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your robot is] *too* big [and] *slow*, compared [to] the *enemies*, to [actually] avoid *contact* [with them]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] *the end of* each level, you'll [fight] a *boss* [battle]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But your] *hearts* [don't] refill [automatically afterwards]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [might] end up having [to] buy a *Health* Refill [from the] shop on the *overworld* next *level*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One* [disconcerting thing is that] when [ya *transform*] back [into] *human form* (since you move much more *slowly* [without] the *[robot] suit*), after playing as the [*robot*] it's, kind of, frustrating [to] suddenly be moving, like, at a *tortoise's pace* again. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [also need to] buy things like [better] swords [and] of course more [*bolt*] bombs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *money is* a [bit] of an *issue* since *enemies* [only] *drop* money on the *overworld* - and *even then* [it's] very *infrequent*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the *[only] way* you [can] really [hope] {to}, [sort] of, afford [to] *buy stuff* is [to] grind [for] *cash* - [especially in spots] like *this*, where enemies [will] keep *coming* over [and] *over* again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *aside from this*, [the] game feels, [*sorta*], repetitive [and] *uninspired*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, granted [it] *looks [pretty] good* [and the] *music* is *decent*, but [tedium will *probably* set] in [before] too *long*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, from] time [to] time, [there will] be some, [sort of], aggravating platforming [moments] (like this *strangely* hard-to-[accomplish] section [right] *here*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [gotta] jump over [some] disappearing [*platforms*, but] a *stream* of enemies keeps pushin' you *back*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] I *kept* [hitting] my head on... *something*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [*wasn't* even] sure [if it was], like, the *gray [platform]* or the *green* one [that was] causing all the *trouble*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *[bottom] line* is "*Keith* Courage..." was a less-[than]-stellar game [and *not really*] the ideal game [to] *bundle* [with] the *console* [in] the [United] *States*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *Japan*, [it] was just another *game* [but] in the *U.S.* became [almost] *symbolic* of the *failure* [of the] *<*Turbo*-Graphics-*Sixteen*::*TurboGrafx-16*>* (sort of as, like, some, kind of, *proof* [that the] system was doomed from the *start*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And there] were *far* [better] *games [released]* so far, like "*R-Type*", or a *few* [of] the games we'll see [later this] *episode*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As [for] *Hudson*, they seem to [have] learned some *lessons* [about] the, uh, <sixteen::16>-[bit] *[Platformer], because* [they ended up publishing] much [better Platforming] Games [in the] *future*, such as "Bonk's *Adventure*". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Alien Crush 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 14 🇯🇵 // 1989 August 29 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Compile 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Naxat Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alright], *here's* one [of the] most highly-[regarded] early P.C. Engine *games, "Alien Crush"*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Normally*, [when] discussing this game, *people* mention the inspiration of *Swiss* [artist], H.R. *Giger*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] on [the *title*] screen we *also* see a direct *lift* from the *Dutch* [artist], M.C. *Escher* - namely his famous "Tessellated *Lizards*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[That] said*, "Alien Crush" really does owe a *huge* debt [to] H.R. Giger's [designs], and [*specifically*] the 'Alien' movies. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *In* the *menu*, you [can] choose the *speed* [as] well [as] one of two [*soundtracks*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alright, we'll] fire her *up here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *yes*, "Alien Crush" is a *Pinball* Game [*developed*] by none other [than] *Compile* (the first Compile game [for the] P.C. *Engine*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *In terms* of overall *game* design, [it's *pretty] standard*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} has the typical double-screen [*layout*] seen in other Pinball Video *Games*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *[We've] seen* a few Pinball Games [for the] FamiCom, [starting with Nintendo's] own "*Pinball*" [from <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Four*::*1984*>] (a [cute but] basic [little] *game*) [and] Coconuts' "*Super* Pinball", [which] came [out] the month *before* "Alien *Crush*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Comparing these two games [to] "Alien *Crush" dramatically demonstrates* the *huge difference* [between the] FamiCom [and] the *P.C. Engine's* graphical *capabilities*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Naturally*, "Alien Crush" [has] various [li'l] bonus *stages*, though they *all* [take] place [on the] same *screen*, [as] far as *I* know. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As ya *may [have noticed]*, the *game* was published by *Naxat*, which means we [now have] a *third* company publishing games [for the] *system*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Naxat] was a software *publishing* arm of Naga *Electronics* Company, which [had partnered with] *N.E.C.*, [from] time [to] time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *name* ['*Naxat*' is] simply *'Taxan' backwards* ([Taxan] being another [subsidiary] of *<~Naga~::{Kaga}>*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A *few FamiCom* games [were released in the] U.S. [under] the [Taxan] name, such [as "<Eight::8>] Eyes" [or] "Fist [of the *North*] Star" [and] *even Hudson's "Star* Soldier". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *They* ended up becoming a major [*publisher* for] the P.C. Engine, so *we'll [certainly]* see *more* of them [in] '*Chronturbo*'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As for *"Alien <~Crash~::[Crush]>"*, [despite its apparent] *simplicity* it's *considered* one [of] the all-time [best] *Pinball* Games [for] a *console*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [just one of] these games where *everything* lined up *[perfectly] - graphics, [sound], playability*, the *pinball physics* [are] *excellent*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *The table* has all [kinds of] cool moving *parts, secrets*, [and] *lots [of]* ways [to get] *bonuses*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Facehugger-type aliens [will] crawl [around] on the *screen*, for example. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is almost] like a *boss* level - a giant *centipede*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 A *few sequels* [and] follow-[ups] would [later] *appear* [and] a *remake* for the *Wii* came [out not that] *long* [ago]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's *odd* [that one of] the [best] games [for the] console, so *far*, is a *Pinball* Game, *but Compile* [and *Naxat really* just sorta] pulled [out] all the *stops* [for] this one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gaia no Monshou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by NCS 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by NCS 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Two* genres [that] were [*absolutely*] unavoidable [in *Japan* at] this *time* were "*Portopia*"-style *Adventure* Games, [and] *Military [Strategy]* Games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *And* [Military Strategy] Games finally come [to the] *P.C. Engine* with "*Gaia* no *Monshou*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Pretty*] awesome *intro* here - [a] guy is riding [giant] *birds*, [a] guy is riding *dolphins*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This* game *looks* cool. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, [as it] *turns [out], looks* can be a [bit *deceiving*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On the main menu, you [can] choose [to] play a [single battle or start the] full *campaign mode*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 An [*important*] factor here is [your] *points*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You *use [them* to] purchase [*units* before] each [*battle*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya also get] {to} choose a *magic* [to] use [in this battle], which'll give ya some, [sort] of, bonus. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, [and what] we're looking [at] *here* is actually "The *Crest* of Gaia" (the *unofficial* English *translation* from '*D*'). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [This looks pretty] darn *simple*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya select] a [*unit*] then move [him around on the *battlefield*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If [you're] next to an *enemy unit*, you [can] *attack*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Some* units (like *crossbowmen*) can [perform] *ranged* attacks. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] all makes *sense, [right]*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, there *are some things* [that *don't*] make sense, *such* as when engaging in *[battles], there* [doesn't] seem [to] be any *indication* of how much *damage* units are *taking*, or how much *life* they have left. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This makes [it]... (*well*), [pretty] darn *difficult* [to plot out] any [sorta *strategy*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, the game [performs] *some [sorta] random dice roll* [at the] beginning of each *turn* [to determine] who has the [next] *move*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [ya might get] a couple turns in a *row* or the *enemy* might. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Again*, [it] makes [*strategizing*, kinda, *difficult*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Then*, [to] make things *weirder*, the game either *gives* you [points or] takes *away* [points], depending on [your *performance*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [this *isn't*] very *surprising*, [but] "*Gaia* no *Monshou*" was [*originally*] a [*Computer*] game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the *P.C.-<[Eighty]-*Eight*::88*> version. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *N.C.S.* (or '*Nippon [Computer*] Systems'), [*sort*] of, *specialized* [in] these [kind] of games since *after "Gaia* no *Monshou*" they <???::[released/produced]> a *follow-up* called "*Langrisser*" [for the] *Genesis* (which [actually got] a *U.S.* [release under] the name "*WarSong*"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *'Langrisser' series* was, uh -- added a more detailed *story* and has, [sort of, like], an R.P.G.-style *slant* to it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[It] became* [pretty] *successful*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [for] *some* reason, in the [*first* battle], I ended up *losing* [points], so I have *fewer* [points to] buy [*units*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Oh*, [and], *by the way*, [your] surviving [*units* don't actually] transfer over to the [next *battle*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] need [to] buy all new *units* each [*battle*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Thus*, I was [pretty] much *outnumbered* [for battle number] *two* from the *get*-go. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *N.C.S.* [eventually released] games under the name '*Masaya*'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The '*Cho* Aniki' games [and] the 'Langrisser' games [are *pretty*] well-*known*, but [expect to] see a [lot] of *lesser*-known Masaya games [in] future [episodes of] '*Chronturbo*'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, *well*, on the [*second* battle] I ended up *winning* [but] lost all [but] one of my *units*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [resulted in] my [points] dropping [below] *zero*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, I [lost] the *game* even though I won the *battle*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, "*Gaia* no *Monshou*" is an *interesting game*, [but] *has some* bizarre [and] maybe even *unfair* rules [that prevent it from] being a really *good game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [it ends] up seeming more like a dry *run* for "*Langrisser*". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Makyō Densetsu 🇯🇵 // The Legendary Axe 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 23 🇯🇵 // 1989 August 29 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by AiCOM 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Victor Interactive Software 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Yet] another third-[party publisher] enters the *fray: Victor* Musical Industries with "*Makyō Densetsu*: The *Legendary Axe*" (or, [as it was] known [around] here [in] the *West*, just "The Legendary *Axe*"). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Let's not* beat around] the bush, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *terms* of side-scrolling Action *[Platformer-type] games*, "[Legendary] Axe" is *The One*, when [it] comes to early P.C. [Engine releases]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "The Kung *Fu*", "J.J. [&] *Jeff*", "Keith *Courage*...", ... - [*forget* about] all [*that*] stuff. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It *certainly*] gets off to an [exciting] *start*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [About <twenty::20> seconds into] the *game* you [fight] the [first] *mini*-boss - a [giant] *spider*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Because* [your] weapon is so *weak* [at] this [point], he *takes* a [while to] *kill*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *check [out] this*: As you *hack away* [at] him, [*pieces* of his] *legs* go *flying off*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *It's* a nice *touch*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Once* [you've] killed ['im], he'll give ya some *[items], including* the first weapon *power*-up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] will add one gem [to your] *axe*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, as you [can] *see*, [your] *Power* Bar up [at] {the} *top*, there, is now *filled up* one-[quarter of] the *way*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 From *time [to] time* you'll also find a few bonus [items] off [the beaten] *path*, such [as] *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *For the* most [part], though, "*Legendary* Axe" [is] a [*pretty* straightforward and] linear Action Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] no R.P.G. elements; [you just *hit*] guys [with your] *axe*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, [for the *most] part*, the game is *very slick* [and] well-*made*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Notice*, for example, how each enemy has a [decent] number [of] *sprites*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [first] *boss* [encounter's with] a couple of rather malicious *bears*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Each* has c... -- a couple {of} *walking sprites*, two *attacking [sprites]*, a [sprite for] falling *back* when *hit*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Everything's* very well-*animated*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [*definitely*] a step up from the *two* [or] three [sprite] animations found on enemies [in most] *FamiCom* games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *here's* the [confusing *text* between] *levels*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Flare is [not] the main *boss*, [but your] *girlfriend* (whom you're tryin' [to] *rescue*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Throughout* most] {of} [the] game, "Legendary Axe" *keeps things [pretty] fresh*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Each level is [different than] the one [*before* and] features [great] detailed *backgrounds*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] there [are *also* some] unusual *enemies*, such as the gigantic rolling *boulder*, which will take ya by [*surprise* the first] time ya s... -- [*encounter*] it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Legendary Axe*" has a definite "*Castlevania*" feel to it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Even though your axe-[wielding] *barbarian* character, *Gogan*, is [*not quite as*] stiff [as] *Belmont*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *[There] are* a few jumping sequences [and while] Gogan's jump takes [some getting] *used to*, he's *much* easier [to] control than *Rastan* [from] *Sega's* game (*which* "Legendary Axe" [greatly] *resembles*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Though], I *wonder* [what sort] of [*climate*] this game takes *place* in. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 On [this] level, we have some tropical-looking [plants and *palm] trees* with a forest of *redwoods* [or] *pine* trees in the *background*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *These guys* seem *borrowed* [right outta] "*Castlevania*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [There's *really* not] much [in] the way of *secrets, here*, [but] there *are* a few cool, semi-[hidden] areas. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Grabbing [that] *key* [will] unlock an area with a few *[items], including* the all-[important] axe *power-up*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As [for] *how [that] power*-up *works*, well, the *[meter] empties* when ya *swing* [your] *axe* [and] then refills [*afterwards*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *takes [about]* a second [to] *refill*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the *strength* of [your] attack [depends] on how far the [meter is] *filled*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, a *series* [of] attacks [in] quick [succession will] be relatively *weak*, whereas [*waiting*] a moment [and] *then* attacking [will be] much more *powerful*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*important thing*] is if [an] *enemy's approaching*, [you'd *better*] make [contact with your first] *swing*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya don't wanna] waste a charged-up *swing*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 By *Level <Four::4>*, [you'll] be able [to collect] the [*last*] power-[up] - *again*, guarded by a [giant] *spider*, though he *does* go down much *faster*, [this] time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If ya *then* [hit] an enemy with a *fully* charged-up attack, the action'll *pause* [for] a sec [while] you unleash a small [*explosion*, capable of] killing regular *enemies* [in] one *hit*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *mechanic* of having [to] wait [to] *charge* [your] attack *lends* a [bit] of a *risk* [and] *reward* [factor to] the game, *especially* during *boss* [battles]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *who developed "Legendary Axe*"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well, Victor* [mostly] used *contract* developers [at] this *time*, and [it] *appears* that *AiCOM* ([the] same guys [who] did "*Amagon*") were *responsible*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *fact, AiCOM* basically *remade* "Legendary Axe" [for] *Jaleco* the next *year* as the "*Astayanax*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We'll see [it] turn up [*later*] on the *FamiCom*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Some sources* [attribute] "Legendary Axe" to Red [and *Atlus* (who] did the *sequel*) [but as] *far [as]* I know, they had nothing [to] do [with the *first*] game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], the *question arises, "How [did] AiCOM* [create] a game *this good* when *all* we've *seen* [from] them so *far* has been, [sorta], terrible?". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Legendary* Axe" features its share [of] fast *enemies*, [but] *not to* the screwed-up level of "*Amagon*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *I call this* inexplicable variation in *quality* among one *publisher* as 'the *Sunsoft* connundrum'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here's* a "[Karate] Kid"-like *bug*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Not] killing* those guys [at the *bottom* will prevent] *any* enemy *encounters* on the *top level*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Normally*, rock-[carrying *gorillas*] break [outta] the walls [at] various [points]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Speaking* of *which*, *here's* one *now*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm [not] sure why bears [and *gorillas* are out to *get] you*, but *two* fully-[charged] strikes [will] take care [of] *these* guys. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So far*, "Legendary Axe" [hasn't] screwed the player [around] *too much*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *this changes* in the [last] *level*, Zone *<Five::5>* ([which is an] *absurdly* long [and *repetitive*] series of *rooms*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you know the *castle level* [in "Super] *Mario <Brothers::Bros.>*" where [ya *hafta*] take a [specific] *path*, or [you] end [up just getting] looped [around into] a *circle, Level <Five::5>* is, [sorta], like *that*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most rooms have either a *well* you [can] drop *down* or a *door* you [can] *exit*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But ya *hafta find*] the [correct] *path* or [you'll just] go [around in] a *circle*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But], unlike "[Super] *Mario* <Brothers::Bros.>", *this level* [is *<twenty-six::26>]* rooms *long* and filled [with difficult] *enemies, including* some bosses [from] prior *levels*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When [*fighting*] these guys, [it's really] hard to avoid taking *damage*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *losing* a *life* means [your] axe [will] drop one *power* level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you *[wanna] be* fully-charged-*up* [for the last] *boss*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And]... *the whole thing* is *really* an *exercise* [in frustrating the] *player* - [an] attempt [to, sort] of, stretch out the game's *length*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *boss* [at] the end [of] Zone <Five::5> is a *[little] creepy*-looking and a l... c..., uh, *can be [difficult]* if [ya don't] have a... fully-charged-up *axe* or ya [don't] use the [right] *strategy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Really* what you] should try [to] do [is] avoid [his *fireballs* and only] attack when [he] *teleports*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When [you] see [him teleport, move over to] where [he's] *appearing*, then [hit him] again with a fully-[charged] *blow*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [He'll] go down [in about] three hits. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *final* boss is [*quite weird*]-looking and *seems* {to} be formed from [the] *spirits* [of] earlier *bosses*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's *actually* [pretty] damned *impressive* - enormously *huge* [and] well-[*animated*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Beating] him is perhaps a [matter] of *luck* since he has a [*pretty*] much unavoidable *leg* kick. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And if] he [decides to always jump] *over* you, [you'll probably get] *killed*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Otherwise*, [just] keep pounding *away* [at him] 'til he [sort of] tur... -- turns a reddish-*purple*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [*while it's* not] *perfect*, "Legendary Axe" [definitely stands with] "*R-Type*" [and] "Alien *Crush*" as the *best* [and] most well-[remembered] games *from the* first two years [of the] P.C. Engine's *existence*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When [it was released] in the *U.S.*, [it *garnered quite] a [lot* of] *praise*, with 'VideoGames [<and::&> Computer Entertainment]' *magazine* awarding [it] the 'Video Game of the *Year*' award [for <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Nine*::*1989*>]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*And*], of course, everyone [sat around] scratching their *heads* wondering why N.E.C. [didn't release this] as the *pack-in* game for the <Turbo-Graphics-*Sixteen*::TurboGrafx-*16*> instead of "Keith *Courage*...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess [that] was a real missed opportunity [for] *N.E.C.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, if [you're] lookin' for [an] early [<Turbo-Graphics::TurboGrafx>] *Action* Game, this [right] here is [*definitely*] the one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fantasy Zone 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 14 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega | Bits Laboratory 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by NEC Avenue 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Things* [are getting] a [little] *weird* here because [our next] game is "*Fantasy* Zone". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [*right* as] *Sega* [was] rolling out [its] new *console*, the *Mega Drive, [it] was* licensing games [for] the *P.C.* Engine. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Even] *stranger*, "[Fantasy] Zone" is the [first] P.C. Engine *game published* by N.E.C. *themselves*, under their 'N.E.C. Avenue' *[brand] name*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *In* the *U.S.*, of course, virtually *every* <Turbo-Graphics::TurboGrafx> game ended up being [published] by N.E.C., [but] *this was* their entry [into] Console game *publication*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [So], *wow*! The *music* is [sorta] *awful*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] *sure* [you all remember "*Fantasy*] Zone", Sega's *Arcade game*, [which we've already] seen [for the] *Master System*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And there was] also a *FamiCom version* by *Sunsoft*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One unusual feature, [at] the *time*, was the, uh -- [collecting] *coins* [from] slain *enemies*, which could then be used in the *shop*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] upgrading the *engine here*; in [other] words, [I'm getting] a *speed*-[up]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You] make [your *selections] here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] now [I'm goin'] a [little bit] *faster*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I *still think* the [*best*] version, other [than] the [*Arcade*] game, is the *Master* System one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [We'll] do a *quick comparison*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the Master System *version*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} *doesn't look* [as good as] the P.C. Engine *version*, [but it] *sounds* [better and] somehow [it] *handles* [better]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Whereas] the *P.C. Engine* had [brighter] *colors* [and vertical] *scrolling*, [but just, sort] of, feels *weird*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was [apparently] *ported* by Bits [*Laboratory*], who [we've] seen [in 'Chrontendo' before] (most [*recently* in "...Episode <Thirty-Eight::38>", with] Square's "*Hanjuku Hero*"). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Graphically speaking*, [this] is closer to the *Arcade game* than previous *releases*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Master [System* "Fantasy] Zone" had you [fighting] bosses against blank [backgrounds]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, [and] here [we *also* get] a *cool animation* where the boss falls [to] *pieces* after [ya *defeat*] him. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Defeating* the] boss [will give] ya lots [of] coins. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 On [the] *other* [hand], the *coins* look *terrible* [and are] *too small*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Next level [is quite] *impressive*, as [some] fake multi-plane *scrolling* has [been] cooked up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The P.C. Engine [couldn't technically] *handle* multi-plane scrolling, [but] *this looks* [pretty] *convincing*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Anyway, "[Fantasy Zone*" is] *one [of the] few games [we've] seen so far [that] pulls off the *hat* trick [of appearing] on *all* three *consoles* - the *FamiCom*, the *Master* [System, and] the P.C. Engine. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sadakichi Sebun: Hideyoshi no Ougon 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Only*] one game was released in November <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Eight*::[*1988]> and* [it's from] *Hudson, "Sadakichi* [Sebun]: *Hideyoshi* no *Ougon*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Note] the chef's knife used [as] a *cursor* on [the *title*] screen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *In 'Chrontendo*', I've long [bemoaned] this *[constant] stream* [of these] Japanese *Adventure* Games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess [it was only] a [matter of] *time*, [but] here's [the] first such game [for] the *P.C. Engine*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] *least* [it] has this *silly* [little] *intro*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*game is* like] a 'James Bond' take-off - *sort of* a goofy *parody of Spy novels [and] *movies*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *opening text* scroll [*informs] you* [of] the [existence of] {a} criminal organization called *Natto*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Which seems [to, sort] of, tie in the whole, uh, *culinary* theme of the *game* here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you've *never heard* of [natto], it's a dish made from fermented *soybeans* [and] is known for its, uh, *[interesting] aroma*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We even see ya tossing [your hat] on [the hat] rack, [just] like in 'James *Bond*'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [According to] 'Mag Weasel''s Kevin *Gifford*, the *main theme* of "Sadakichi [Sebun]..." is the *clash* [between] the *cultures* of *Osaka* [and] *Tokyo*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And *apparently*] much [of] the game is [written] in *heavy* Osaka *dialect*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Aside* [from *that], however*, [it] *seems* [to] work [just] like every *other such game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya mostly] use the '*Look*', ['*Investigate*', and] '*Talk*' commands. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya talk to] *people* {and} ask them [about specific] *things*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *game* [will] actually make a *chime* sound when you [do something important], like unlock a new *menu* option. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, yeah, [it's] nothing* we [haven't] *seen before* - [just, sort] of, a regular old FamiCom *Adventure Game* with [slightly better] *graphics*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the [writing's really] *funny*, [but that's probably] something [that's not gonna be] picked up [with] anyone who's [not really into] Japanese *dialect* humor. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to P.C. Engine C.D. ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alright], *folks*! *Here* is where the [world] of video *games* changes *forever* [and] where '*Chronturbo*' [starts getting *exciting*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *So far*, all the games we've seen [have been released] on those *tiny [little] HuCards, which* typically held [about] <Two::2> Megabits *or [about]* <Two-[Hundred-and-Sixty]-Two::262> [*kilobytes* - around the] same [as most] *FamiCom* carts. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, on December *<Fourth::4th> <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Eight*::[1988]>, N.E.C.* [released] the first *upgrade* [to] the *P.C.* Engine, the <C.D.-*ROM*-ROM::CD-*ROM*²> system. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just like] how the FamiCom [*Disk* System] allowed the *FamiCom* [to] play games on *floppy disks*, the <C.D.-*ROM*-ROM::CD-*ROM*²> allowed games [to be] played on C.D.-*ROMs*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yep! Six years* [before] the *PlayStation* and five years [before] "*MYST*", *Hudson* [and] N.E.C. [started putting out] games on C.D.-ROM. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Hell*! Even Sega's *Mega* C.D. [wouldn't] come [out for] another three *years*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The first C.D.-ROM home [*Computer*] game (which was a release of Cyan's "[The] *Manhole*") [didn't come out until] <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Nine*::[*1989*]>. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *worked*, sorta, [like] the FamiCom [Disk] System [except that] a [separate] *connector* piece [was required to] hook up the P.C. Engine [and] the <[C.D.]-ROM-ROM::[CD]-ROM²> *system*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, [to actually] *use* the C.D.-*ROM*, [ya need to put in the] <C.D.-ROM-ROM::CD-ROM²> *system* card into the P.C. Engine *card* slot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This contained the *BIOS* [and] an added <[Sixty]-Four-K::64K> of *RAM* as a *buffer*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Later*], the amount [of] *RAM* would be *increased* with the *Super* <C.D.-ROM-ROM::CD-ROM²> system. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], *aside from* games, the *C.D.-ROM* [could] be used [to] play regular *C.D.s*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Pop one *in* [and ya get] this *interface*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In <*Nineteen*-[Eighty-Eight]::[*1988*]>, not too [many people even] *had* C.D. *players*, much less C.D.-*ROM* drives [in] their [*computers*], so *this* was *way* [ahead of its] *time*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [*what was*] the *advantage* [of] the C.D.-ROM *format*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, a huge *increase* [in the amount] of *space*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A HuCard could *hold around* a [quarter] of a [*megabyte*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The C.D.-*ROM* could hold <five-*hundred*::*500*> megabytes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's <*two*-thousand::*2,000> times* the [available] *space*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Wow*! [What would] developers *do* [with] all [that] *space*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well, music* [for] *one* - no more relying on crummy [*sound*] chips. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *let's [start]* by taking a look at the two games [that] were released as *launch* [titles] on [December] <Fourth::4th>. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fighting Street 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 4 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom | Alfa System 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *And* our first C.D.-*ROM* game *is Capcom's "[Fighting]* Street", though [it's actually published] by *Hudson* [and] *ported* by *Alfa* <~Systems~::[System]> (a *small* company [that will] *turn* up [quite] a [*bit* in] '*Chronturbo*'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Most* [of] Capcom's *games for the console* would end up being [published] by [other] *companies*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, we [were] asking [what] all [this] extra *space* on the C.D.-*ROM* [could be] *used for*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well, in *this] case*, they [went with] pre-recorded *music*; [let's] check [it] *out*. 🍇

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Country Select" ♪ from "Fighting Street"

✅🏮🍊🍓 "U.S.A.!" 🍇🍌


🎧🏮🍊♪ "Versus Theme" ♪ from "Fighting Street"

✅🏮🍊🍓 "*Round* <One::1>!" 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, the *speech* [is still] *horrible* [and sounds] *hardware-based*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "*[Fighting] Street*" is, [in] fact, the game also known as "*Street* [Fighter]" (the *first* '[Street Fighter]' game). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Something* looks *screwy* here - like, why [my] -- keep *punching* [at] the *air*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *We'll* discuss [that in just a *second*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [*might* recall "Street Fighter" from] the "<Nineteen-[Eighty]-Seven::1987> Arcade *Round* Up". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *The game* was [not] a *success*, unlike its *sequel, [and] no one* [really] *plays* [it *today*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *check [out]* the *Arcade* version's *music*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yep*! [The] P.C. *Engine* [got] a major *music* upgrade. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] *Arcade game* did have [better] *colors*, however, *and* more detailed [*backgrounds*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still*, when {you} *do* a comparison [between] the Arcade [and] *Console versions*, you'll *see* [the] sprites *do* [look *pretty*] darn *similar*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *why [did] no* one *play this game*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, because [it] was *awful*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] plays *nothing* like "[Street Fighter] *<Two::II>*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are only] two *characters*, Ryu [and] *Ken*, [and] I [*believe*] they have [exactly] the same *moves*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] no *combos*, you can't [*attack*] while you're *jumping* (or *even* while taking a *step*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's *also* infamous [for] *this: terrible speech* samples. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Apparently], in the interest of faithfulness [to] the [*original*, it was decided to, sort of, *take*] the *speech* [directly from the *Arcade*] game *rather* [than] *re-recording* it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], *one problem* here: *Special moves* are difficult to [*impossible* to] pull off. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Hadouken* is *here*, [and] so is the *Hurricane* Kick, [but] the *odds* of [successfully *executing* the] *move* [are, like, <*twenty* to] *one*::*20*:]*1*>. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] see [from the] *videos*, I [spent] *much* [of] my <~trime~::[time]> *trying* [and] *failing* [to do a Hadouken] or *Hurricane* Kick [and ended up just] punching [and] kicking the *air*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[You're] lucky* I [got] even one successful attempt *recorded*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The *Arcade game* is not very] good *and this* [version is] even worse. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The six [*buttons* have] been [reduced to] *two* [buttons]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The controls are *unresponsive*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} [doesn't] feel [*precise*], the way "[Street Fighter] *<Two::II>" did*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If [ya *like] the [sequel]*, you'd [*probably* get] pissed-off [with "Fighting Street" *pretty] quickly*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As [for] why they [changed the] *name* [from "*Street Fighter*" to "*Fighting Street"], no idea* ([unless] they were [just tryin'] to avoid *association* [with the] *Arcade* game). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still*, {it} does have [great-sounding] *music*! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 No-Ri-Ko 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 4 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Alfa System 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *other* <C.D.-ROM-ROM::CD-ROM²> system launch [*title*] showed a [*completely* different] *direction* [for the] new *medium*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*No-Ri-Ko*", [also from] *Hudson*, falls into the '[Not Really] A *Game*' [category], *though* there are some minimal [interactive] *elements*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *The disc* [is] based [around] *viewing [pictures* and *recordings*] of [Noriko Ogawa - one of] those so-called '*idols*' [that're popular in the] Far *East*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 She [should not] be [confused with] the *other* Noriko *Ogawa*, a [classical] pianist, who is much more well-known [in] the [West] than the *idol* Noriko. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] the idea [of] basing a game around her *seems* a [little] *odd*, the *C.D.-ROM* [format] is, [in fact], the [perfect vehicle for such a] *concept*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As [you *recall], Nintendo* [released] a Nakayama *Miho* video *game* - [and] *this idea* is *similar* [except that] we [can] now [actually] have [Noriko's] *voice* [in] the [game]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For a *singer* [and] *actress*, this makes [perfect] *sense*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Rather than [relying] on an [<eight::8>-bit *representation* and] a box [of] *text*, we [can] now have [digitized *photographs*] and *recordings* of [her] *songs*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Well*, let's] *take* a *listen*. 🍇

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Kowareru (Broken)" ♪ by Noriko Ogawa

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Certainly], nothing like* this was even [*remotely possible*] on earlier *game* consoles. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Okay*, so *what's* the game like? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, the story [is that you] go to [the Noriko] concert [and] then go backstage [to *meet] her*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, sure [enough], she's *really nice* [and] *down* [to] *earth*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *guess what*? You *get* [to] *go* [out on] a [*date* with] her! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] *next* major section [of] the game is *the date*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We have more [digitized] *photos here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [have] a few [little] menus [from] time [to] *time*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 For [example], you [can] choose what [to] *do* on the date. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Going [out to eat will result in] you spinning a wheel [to] see [what Noriko will] *eat*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya also] get [to] go *shopping* [and] see her trying on various [*outfits*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Really], the whole thing* is [just] an excuse [to] view various adorable [pictures] of [Noriko and] listen to [her] *talk* [to ya]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *You [can]* even make [her] *dance*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this [part], you *control her* by pressing the [buttons] on the *D-Pad*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} turns [out] she dances [like] a goddamn *spaz*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] why the hell [is she] wearing a *referee [shirt* throughout] much [of] the game? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya know, I *keep* calling this a game, but *it's [not] really*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [don't] know [if] you [can] *win* or *lose* "No-Ri-Ko". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Despite] the [fact that] after the *date* you get [caught in] the *rain* [and] ending up drinking [hot chocolate at her] *pad*, I'm [*pretty] sure* there's no way [to get] lucky with *her*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There is a *trivia* quiz [and a] game of '[Rock] Paper *Scissors*'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] so *maybe* there's some, [sort] of, unlockable *content*, [but] *everything* [is completely] G-[*rated*, I'm] *sure*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, while "No-Ri-Ko"* seems [pretty pointless and] pandering by [*today's standards, it] was* unique [and] *new* [in <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Eight*::1988>]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [was] nothing *like [it]* because there *weren't* other [C.D.]-*ROM* games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [while] the path Hudson *chose* [with] "*No-Ri-Ko*" [eventually] led [to] the *dead-end* of stuff like "Kris Kross: Make My *Video*", [ya *can't] really*, uh, *blame them* for experimenting in a new *medium*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *no*, [it's not] a good game [or] nothing you'll [probably wanna] *play*, [but] *yes*, I [suppose] it is a *success* as an experiment for the <C.D.-ROM-ROM::CD-ROM²> *system*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Space Harrier 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 9 🇯🇵 // 1990 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega | Dempa Shinbunsha 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by NEC Avenue 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Okay*, so we're [back to] the HuCards *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *And* it's another damn *Sega* game! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 What's goin' *on*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just like "*Fantasy] Zone*", it's published by N.E.C. *Avenue* [in] *Japan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Under* the '*Mode*' option, you [can select] which *control* scheme ya *want*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (You [can] do *regular* [or *inverted*].) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Not* too many games [featured *setup*] options [at this] time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But with the] *P.C. Engine*, [different] control schemes, [and sound] tests, [and that kinda] thing [would] *become* more *common*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Space Harrier*" was, of course, Sega's [massively popular] *Super Scaler* game *which [used* sprite]-based <Three-D::3D> [*effects*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*It was* noted for] being [*just* about the fastest, craziest, *loudest*, and] most *extreme Arcade* game [in *existence*] when [it] came [out in <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Six*::*1986*>]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Consoles were not really *capable*] of [replicating] a game like "*Space* Harrier" [*but the] P.C.* Engine comes [*somewhat*] close. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Let's] do [some comparisons]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's [the *Arcade game*], very fast {and} *smooth*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Then* here's the *Master* System *version* ([p... -- previously] seen [in] "Chronsega [Episode] *<Two::2>"*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [an] ugly *mess*, [but] it's *still amazing* [that] they [pulled this] off on [the] *Master* System. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *And here's* the P.C. Engine *again*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Well*], you'll [notice] the *checkerboard* on the planet's *surface* is gone [for] some *reason*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[But] the [fact* that] N.E.C.'s [hardware] could handle a bunch [of sprites at] *once*, avoids all the crazy flickering of the *Master* System game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, the colors [are] more [accurate and it's *not* as] slowed-*down* as the Sega [Master System] *version* [of] "Space Harrier". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *P.C.* Engine's [*sound*] chip [can't quite replicate] the *voices, [but] they* are [somewhat] *recognizable*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, [on the negative] side: The *explosions* [are] much *punier* than the Arcade game's. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], *by* the way, "*Space Harrier*" [is] a big *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] the first <Four::4>-[*Megabit*] card [for the] P.C. Engine. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega themselves [had] released a few m... -- uh, <Four::4>-[Megabit] cards [for] the [*Master* System] such [as "Phantasy] Star" [and] "*AfterBurner*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, [but] <Three::3>-Megs [was still pretty] much the [limit for] the *FamiCom* [at] this point. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [it was] *ported* to the P.C. *Engine* by *Dempa Shinbunsha*, who is [*mostly*] known [for porting] *Arcade* games [to Japanese *computers* - and for] making [some] *hardware*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [believe] they [released some] *add-ons* [for] the *P.C. Engine*, [such as, like], [*Arcade*-style] *joysticks*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, all [in] all*, [it's pretty] *good*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [better than the] FamiCom *game* or the Master [System] *release*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] still [not quite] the full "Space Harrier" [*experience*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And I *do wonder, "Why was* Sega so *anxious* [to put out] *games* on *[competitors'] consoles*?". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dragon Spirit 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 16 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Namco* [returns in] the middle of [*December* with] their [second] *game* this *episode, "Dragon* [Spirit]" - a [*Vertical Shoot*]-'em-Up [in] which you control a *dragon* (rather [than] the usual *spaceship* [or] *airplane* [or somethin']). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here we see* the P.C. Engine's *color* [palette was *wide* enough], *they [could* put] a *blue dragon* on a *blue background* [and] *still have* [everything] *easy* [to] *see*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*So, your cute little*] dragon [breathes] *fire* on flying enemies [and] drops... *something* on *ground* enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[In other] words, "Dragon* [Spirit]" *very* -- is very similar [to] Namco's "*Xevious*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Fire* [and] *Bomb* have [separate *buttons*], so [ya hafta] switch [between the] two. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *my opinion*, this works okay [in] *Arcade* machines, [but] I *think* [most] folks use their *thumbs* [to] press {a} [button] on a *console* controller, *so* [it doesn't work quite as] *well*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Aside*] from *enemies*, you'll [need to] bomb *eggs*, [which] contain *power*-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Red eggs [will] increase [your] *firepower* [and] blue ones [will] cause you to grow [an] extra *head* (which *also* [increases your] firepower). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Arcade game* [came out in <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Seven*::*1987*> and *had*] a *cool intro* [which showed that your] *dragon* [was actually] a transformed human *being*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Arcade game* was a [bit] *faster*, [and it] had more [detailed] *graphics*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But it *wasn't* exactly] a *powerhouse* [in the] *hardware* [department (not] compared [to the] newer *Namco* boards). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Thus*, the *P.C. Engine "Dragon* [Spirit]" *is a [pretty]* good *recreation* of the [*original*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some [of] the details [were] *lost*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [water] is a [flat] *blue* color *here*, [and] the *screen* dimensions have been *changed*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But *definitely*, it's] the [closest] thing [to the *Arcade*] game [out of] the various *home* versions. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, *near* the *end* [of the] *game*, levels were *changed* [or] *dropped*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I assume [that] the HuCard *size* [limitations] were the *cause* of *some* [of] the missing *content* [such as] the *intro*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Other power-[ups] do* appear [from] time [to] *time*, usually [dropped] by special flashing *enemies*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *These [are cool but]* they have [limited] *use* [and] they [*tend* to] *disappear* when [ya really] *need* ['em]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] thing is, *personally*, I [*don't* really] *like* "Dragon [Spirit]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*backgrounds*] seem [kind] of *dull* [in] *places* [and] the *enemies [tend* to] be *small* [and *unimpressive]-looking*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [*don't really* like] the two-[button *control*] for air [and] *ground enemies*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But], *most [of] all*, the game is a *bit tedious* [and] a *pain* [to] *play*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] *dragon* is [*pretty*] damned *large, [especially]* when powered-[up with multiple] *heads*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ground] *enemies* [shoot] these *[little] tiny [projectiles* often] clustered [together] *so close* [that] you [literally *cannot*] squeeze [*between* them]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's *really*] easy [to get] *boxed in* by flying enemies, [projectiles, and *ground*] hazards [like] the *volcanoes* here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *"Dragon [Spirit]" [isn't] like* [one of those] *modern* [Shoot]-'em-*Ups* where [ya] have a *[little] teeny tiny [hitbox]*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Nope*! If anything touches even the *tip* of [your] *wing, 'Blam*!', [you're] *dead*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [What] this means [is that memorization is *required* to] know where the [enemies will] *appear* [so you can *position* yourself and *blast] them* [before they start shooting *projectiles*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *On top* of this, ya throw [in] a [*checkpoint system* and] the [fact that ya] lose all [your] *power-ups* when ya *die*, {and} ya *have, [sort of*, an infuriating] *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Some*] bosses [can be] next to [*impossible* without] being powered-*up, this guy*, for example. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If ya die [before] *reaching* him, [ya *probably won't* have enough] *firepower* [to] clear [out] all his screen-filling [*projectiles*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here*, [since] I have [the] *three heads*, I can just [*shoot* 'im] *away*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But if you're back to] the single *head*, 'Boy!', [you're not gonna be able to *shoot*] more [than] a *couple* [of] those things [before] they [*hit ya*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "*Dragon [Spirit]*" is a game I *[really wanted to] like* [but just] *couldn't*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Later] on*, [however, we'll] see a [completely] *new version* [for] *the FamiCom* [and] a much [better] sequel for the P.C. *Engine*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Appare! Gateball 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Westone 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Alright, we* have another one from *Hudson here, "Appare! Gateball*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or [perhaps it's better pronounced] "Appare! *Gateball*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [One of the] very few *video* games [devoted to *Gateball*], *which is a* Japanese variation on *Croquet*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One* rather handy option [you'll] find [in] the *menu* is a *rather* detailed explanation of how [to] *play* [*Gateball*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *In-game [instructions]* were *[pretty] unusual* in *Console* games back then. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [don't think Gateball is] too terribly *popular*, so, *unlike* Baseball or *Golf, [not]* everybody knows the *rules*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the *[first] thing* [to] do [is] pick [your] *team*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You've [got] a number of colorful *characters, each* with their own *stats*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'm *not] sure* [if] they [represent] the real-life *spectrum* of [*Gateball*] players, *as I think it's* [mostly] played by *old* folks. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Gateball]* [is] a *team sport*, [and] the [*object*] is [to get] the *balls* through three *gates* (in the correct *order* [and] *direction*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Players* [from] each team [take] turns. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *control* mechanic is *almost* taken [*directly*] from contemporary *Golf* Games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You control, first [of] all, the direction you [wanna *hit*] the *ball* [and] then ya have [the typical] *Power* [Meter]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, [in] *this case*, the [object] is simply to [*hit*] the [*button right*] when the [*meter*] reaches the *arrow*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Unlike] Golf*, [you're *not*] simply [tryin' to get] the ball [in] the [general] *direction* of the green. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You're tryin' to get it through] a very small *hoop*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This means you [must *stop*] the [meter *precisely*] on the *arrow*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Even a *[little bit] off* [will] cause a *miss*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If [you're] *successful* [in getting] a ball through a *gate*, you'll [actually get] another *turn* [and] keep on *doing* so [until ya] *miss*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Like* Croquet, if [ya *hit* another] *ball*, you [can] then place your ball *next* to it [and] then knock the [opponent's] ball [out] of [*bounds*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Or* [if ya hit] a *teammate's* ball, you [can] knock their ball to a [better] *location*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In [fact, *Gateball*] seems *more* to involve [shooting] other *balls around* rather [than actually tryin' to get] through a *hoop*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Now*, [it] *seems* reasonably *fun*, though the *C.P.U.* hardly *ever* gets a bad [*shot*] in [or misses its *target*, so it] *can* [get] a [bit *frustrating*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing [that's* not] very *clear* is, "*Who developed* [this] game?". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some Japanese sources say [it] was by *Westone* ({the} same guys [who] did the '*Wonder* Boy's games). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... *By the [way]*, I've [been] calling them '*WestOne*', [but] *someone* says the [pronunciation] is [not *correct*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Of] course*, when [you're dealing with] a Japanese *company* [that] has a made-up English *name*, it's hard [to] say what the [correct pronunciation] *is*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But it] *turns [out* it's] a [portmanteau] of '*West*' and '*Stone*', so 'WesTone' seems [*logical*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Like* [I] was *saying*, they're [often] listed as the *developers* [but] *then there's also* [this mysterious] company called *Azuma* in the *credits*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Are they the *co-developer*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or [are] they maybe the [*artist* who did] the *character portraits*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I *[dunno*; it's] a mystery [to] *me*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well], *anyway*, the *final* conclusion is [that] "*Appare*! [Gateball]" is [*not*] a bad [little] *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If ya [like Sports] Games based on obscure *sports* [that] you've never played [in real] *life, then* [ya *might wanna] check* this out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] it's [*definitely*] no "Super *Dodgeball*". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Bikkuriman Daijikai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 <*Nineteen*-[Eighty-Eight]::1988> [closes out] with the third C.D.-*ROM* [title], "*Bikkuriman Daijikai*" - the [*second*] game [from] *Hudson* based on the series of [collectible] *cards*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As [you] recall [from] "Chronturbo ... *<One::1>", Hudson* took "Wonder Boy [in] *Monster* Land", [changed] the [sprites, and released] it as "*Bikkuriman* World". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game has some *wild music*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *And, much like "No-Ri-Ko"*, a good [amount] of [recorded] speech. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If *[it] seems weird* [that] Hudson [released] another '*Bikkuriman*' [title] so *quickly, keep in* mind [that] 'Bikkuriman' was *incredibly [popular* in Japan at this] *time*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, on* the main screen here, we [have] a *few* [different] *selections*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's these different *levels*, but *three* out of *four* [are] *locked*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [we'll hafta start with the] *first* one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *[don't]* be *disappointed* [but] if *you're* expecting something [like] "*Bikkuriman* World", *well*, it's nothing like that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *fact, much like "No-Ri-Ko"*, [it's not really] a *game*; [it's] *almost* more of a [*database*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, '*Bikkuriman*' was a series [of collectible] *cards*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *this disc* is *basically* a *card* [database]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's, [sorta], like a 'Bikkuriman' *encyclopedia*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] scroll [through the] *cards* [and] look [at] the details of each *character*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This does sound [pretty] *boring*, [but] there *are* a few [interactive] *elements*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can *only] view* a [handful of] cards [at] *first*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then a *quiz* section [will] pop up [and ya need to] answer a *question* [about] '*Bikkuriman*'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If [ya get it *correct*], you'll unlock a special 'Bikkuriman' *character* called a *head* [and another] series of *cards*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Wow, [that *little] angel chick* is *really happy* [that] I [got] the *answer* right. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *again*, some *[pretty] wacky music*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] as *far [as I'm] aware*, [this is pretty] much how the entire disc *goes*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You're just] unlocking more *cards* [and eventually] the other areas we saw on the main *screen*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But]... there *is* a [bit] *more*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For [example], you [can] also unlock this -- [these animated] *cutscenes* [and] you [can] view them *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *technically, there's* a [*lot*] of *content* on this *disc* - many dozens of *characters* (each with their own illustration [and] *stats*), lots [of animated] *cutscenes*, ... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] *non-music* [part] of the [disc] *comes* to over *<forty::40> megabytes* [of *data*], with the entire disc being around <Three-*Hundred*::*300*> megabytes. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *[That] was* [another really great] thing [about] the [C.D.]-ROM [*format*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [could] cram *tons* of graphics [and] *text* onto it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [was] no more struggling [to *fit*] everything onto a <Two::2> Megabit *card*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Much like "*No-Ri-Ko*", "Bikkuriman Daijikai" is [*not*] a disc you'd wanna *play* nowadays [*but it] is*, [in] some ways, still a [bit] of a [landmark *title*]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 2 Wrap Up ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Wow! So*, there [ya] *go*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We've [got through the] first year [and] a *half* of the new *console*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *All told, there* were *<twenty-two::22>* games [released for] the [relatively] new P.C. Engine [in] <Nineteen-[Eighty]-*Eight*::[*1988*]>. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, <*Nineteen*-[Eighty]-Nine::[1989]> is [gonna] be the year [that] *things* really *pick up* [quite] a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Chronturbo Episode <Three::3>" [will] be a full <fifteen::15> *games*, [just] like '*Chrontendo*'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 What's [gonna] happen [next] *time*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, *more* new *publishers*, [for] *one*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, [for the first] *time*, the *majority* [of] games [will not] be [from] *Hudson*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We'll also see [some *Arcade] ports*, [an] *R.P.G.*, *Shoot-'em-Ups*, *Sports Games*, and a classic Military *Strategy* Game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, after* a few more episodes of '*Chrontendo*', join us for "Chronturbo ... <Number *Three*::#*3*>"! 🍇🍌
