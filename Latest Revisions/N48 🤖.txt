👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ A Brief Apology ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey folks, Dr. Sparkle here, alive and well, believe it or not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And yeah, it's been a long time since I've put up a new episode of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there was a long delay on the episode before that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the sad thing is I actually had a lot of work done on "...Episode 48" when the last one was uploaded. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I planned out a timeline as to how long it would take me to finish "...Episode 48" and work on the new 'Chronturbo' and 'Chronsega'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, absolutely none of that happened. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And now I don't really want to go too much into the details of my personal life and give you excuses and that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But looking back now, well, actually did take a new position at work that allowed me to work from home. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And quite frankly, I thought having an extra hour or so a day not spent commuting back and for to work would give me extra time to do things like work on 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But in fact, that didn't really work out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 My scheduled work hours are now much later in the day. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when my old work schedule, I'd actually have a bit of time after work before my wife got home, sort of, do things like this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now working later in the day, I [pretty] much need to start making dinner or have to go to the store something immediately after I get off work. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And due to various health issues with my wife's family, she has less time to commit to helping me with that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So [pretty] much by the time we're done with dinner and the dishes and all that crap, it's [pretty] late at night. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I really have had a lot of difficulty finding time to, sort of, squeeze in for 'Chrontendo'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also There is unfortunately, sort of, a snowball effect when you get really behind on something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once it becomes so, so late, it somehow becomes harder to finish. And that final 10% takes longer than the first 90%. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know why. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So bottom line is I've been having to put some serious thought and how I schedule my time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's for some reason, just more difficult now than it was a year ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In order to find time for content, oh, I'm gonna have to be more disciplined, I guess. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I actually also have a couple of new projects coming up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But that said, 'Chronsega' and 'Chronturbo' will always take less time than the Nintendo stuff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So those episodes will obviously not take eight months, or however long it's been I've been working on this one. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also, I kind of hope that working on some of these new projects between episodes of 'Chrontendo' will buy me a bit of extra sanity. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sort of, flush out all the mental poisons that happen when you work on content. Oh - sort of, a mental mental enema, if you will. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 48 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "...Episode 48" has another 15 games, most of which are not very good. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But we do have some weird s--- here, including that crazy Capcom game based on a movie that I mentioned last time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, the "1989 Arcade Round-Up", which is just so goddamn long. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 RoboCop 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 August 25 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East | Sakata SAS 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, let's start the new episode with "RoboCop" a game based on the classic 1987 Paul Verhoeven action movie, which, as I'm sure you recall, is about a copy of it killed by mobsters and brought back to life as a, sort of, robot Jesus. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this sounds [pretty] good, right? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, by now you should actually know better. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll be screen shows that this was a license from Ocean Software, a man kuhnian video game publisher known for putting out tons and tons of licensed crap, and who years later eventually got folded into the Atari brand. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, they released this in the United States virtually unchanged using the same name. "RoboCop". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Crime on Nash Avenue, isn't even a Nash Avenue in Detroit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently this game takes place in Ypsilanti. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For some reason (despite "RoboCop" being a seven foot tall, heavily armed Cyborg) everyone in the neighborhood seems to want to attack him while unarmed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally "RoboCop" can simply dispatch these dudes with a single punch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'But Dr. Sparkle', you say, 'he's got a gun. Why doesn't he shoot people?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the game does not actually let you choose when to use the gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "RoboCop" will automatically pull out his gun in certain areas and holster it and others. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 See here we go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "RoboCop" is a port of Data East 1980s Arcade game and looks very similar to the Arcade original. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the Arcade "RoboCop" was not too Good. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was a [pretty] simple walking gun game (miles behind something like "Contra" in terms of sophistication and fun). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you might be asking if the home game was based on Data East Arcade game, why was it licensed from ocean? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well apparently ocean off the video game rights "RoboCop" even before the movie was made. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So they just had to obtain the rights from ocean and then of course, ocean ported the Arcade game to various computers, such as the Commodore 64 the spectrum. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The specie version somehow received a massive critical and popular Acclaim in England. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's kind of like the Aquamarine of time for the spectrum or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was number one on the spectrum sales charts for a full year and a half. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the first boss; no idea who it is or what this guy is supposed to be. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The fight is kind of odd, because it can't be harmed by your gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you might think, 'Well, how do I kill this guy?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But as soon as you get within punching range, you stop using a gun and just start hitting him instead, which does eventually kill him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there's actually no way Knowing this until you get right up close to the guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "RoboCop" also looks really stupid when he talks like his tongue is sticking out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They have two Life Bar things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your power is like your regular Life Bar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It shrinks as you take damage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To his time I believe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It slowly ticks down and when it empty your batteries run out, which is [pretty] stupid when you think about it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, "RoboCop" having these batteries that just die and leave him powerless after a few hours or whatever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um, but the display is [pretty] weird. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Under functions, for example, is where you see rubber cops face. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That flashes when there is a destructible wall nearby. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not the would ever guess that just by looking at the icon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As the game progresses it you'll see that it, sort of, follows the movie's plot, but there's really not much here in terms of any kind of like storyline. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "RoboCop" is not an utterly awful game, but it's certainly nowhere near as cool as you would hope it would be. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Racer Mini Yonku: Japan Cup 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 August 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, for last Japanese game of August 1989, we get into a rather obscure genre, the world of Mini Yonku Racing Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So from Konami, we have "Racer Mini Yonku: Japan Cup". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Notice the credit to Tamiya on the title screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This demo screen shows some of the, sort of, the different types of races we have here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All down, [pretty] radical. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so what is mendonca? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's also known as many four wheel drive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Involves racing these little tiny but very fast motorized toy cars, kind of like R.C. cars, but you have no type of steering or control mechanism. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was more or less created by the Japanese model company to Mia in the mid-1980s and became quite popular in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game isn't officially authorized to me a tie-in so their logo appears in game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I assume names of the actual car models were used. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess I have to give Konami a certain amount of credit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather than making a standard Racing Game they made in toward like this weird Board Game with racing elements. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you recall, we've seen several game of life style video game Board Games, and it's actually quite similar to that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You take turns rolling dice, or in this case, it's more like a spinning a roulette wheel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You move around the board making money or losing money, all of these rather charming animations. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here's the thing about the whole many yokoo hobby. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Buying the car is just the beginning. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The cars you buy off the shelf are [pretty] crappy. So you need to start customizing it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to purchase all kinds of upgraded bumpers and wheels and whatnot make your car go faster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So as a result, the game [pretty] much revolves around buying car parts, even more than in most Racing Games of this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Improved parts from most everything can be purchased. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here's the weird thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The races themselves are completely automatic. As far as I can tell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can't control your vehicle at all, just like in real life, many entrepreneurs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Literally Konami and Tamiya are engaging in some kind of interesting cross branding synergy here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And those of you who are not into many own cou racing, which I'm [pretty] sure as just about every single one of you will not get much out of this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nor do I really understand the mechanics of this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite having absolutely no idea what I was doing. I somehow came up first. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is a scripted. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not even really sure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, you always win this race. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is for multiple players, so I'm not even sure exactly how this is supposed to work. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway it's a rather strange game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now before moving on to September we've got exactly one U.S.-[only] him to look at. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jordan Vs Bird: One on One 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 August [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by E.A. | Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Milton Bradley 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alrighty then we have but a single U.S.-[only] game today from August 1989 "Jordan Vs Bird: One-on-One" published by Milton Bradley but copyrighted to Electronic Arts. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, holy hell, what is this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What is going on here? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh god damn, that's ugly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a crudely done 8-bit conversion of the one-on-one Jordan versus Byrd box art photo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Someone just traced the photo and drew out a pixelated version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of what happened today. Gordon's shirt. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is just a bit more proof that Rare simply did not give one s--- when it came to all the for hire work there bruising at the time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And yes, as you may have noticed on the credit screen this was ported by Rare who had done all of the previous Milton Bradley N.E.S. games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jordan versus Byrd was a sequel to the pioneering computer Basketball Game one-on-one Dr. J versus Larry Bird. Originally released in 1983 by EA. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He was one of the very first Sports Games to officially use the names and likenesses of big name sports stars. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The sequel, Jordan vs. bird came out on computers in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He had much improved graphics but didn't really have the following of the first game, which people just loved to death when it came out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now as far as I can gather Critical reception was [pretty] lukewarm to this game. (At least the original Computer version). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is not bad but nothing special; just doesn't really live up to the name of the guys on the cover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So clearly when it came to porting this Rare made some compromises. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The audience have been removed and a brick wall put in its place. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game In simple one-on-one basketball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not that hard to get the ball in the basket. But defense is tricky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Stealing the ball just doesn't seem to happen that much. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I didn't figure out how to effectively get the ball after a rebound. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now of course, there are penalties for traveling blocking charging, which seemed to be handed out in a rather arbitrary fashion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It really kind of hard to say what triggers a foul. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I once got traveling and mid-jump. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from the one-on-one part, there are these dunking contest and three point shot contests. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's nothing too interesting here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The slam dunks have all have these cool names, but it's really just a matter of holding down the button at exactly the right time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even the concept of Jordan versus bird is a little weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those guys were, sort of, from different areas of basketball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean Tibet, they didn't make up Matt Johnson versus bird game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That would have made more sense because they were actually, sort of, considered to be rivals or in the mid-'80s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, that's Jordan versus bird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And with that, we wrap up August 1989. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gekitou Tecmo Pro Wrestling!! Toukon Densetsu 🇯🇵 // Tecmo World Wrestling 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 September 01 🇯🇵 // 1990 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tecmo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that's some [pretty] jaunty theme music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is Tecmo's "giki toe pro wrestling" took on Densetsu the first game of September 89, and the [only] game released in the first two weeks of September. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure why but September is a really bottom heavy month. with about six games coming out on the 29th alone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You get your standard collection of wrestlers many which are inspired by real life wrestlers Nate noninfringing, sort of, way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first guy here is naturally based on Antonio inoki. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy is based on a fictional wrestler called Tiger Mask is actually a manga character in the late '60s, early '70s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tiger mass became, sort of, an archetypal wrestling figure, and he does turn up in several Wrestling Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was kind of odd; when checking the game on hardcore gaming one-on-one, they stated this character's name is Christ hyper. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I thought, Wow, that's a [pretty] bizarre name. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yet in-game the characters referred to as while resuit Piper. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now Haifa is definitely hyper. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But while resuit I have no idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I checked the spelling of Christ in Japanese and the standard form is p resuit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So sadly, I don't think this guy is really called price typer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, you should still definitely check out the hardcore gaming 101 article on this game as they show the character illustrations from the manual, which are actually quite cute and Goofy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In spring of 1990 Tecmo released in the U.S. as Tecmo World Wrestling, putting the company's name in the title as they do with like tech, mobile and various other Sports Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is virtually unchanged in the U.S. version. Other than the names being altered, and some of the characters getting new artwork. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Are these little minigames where you can increase your strength through exercising. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just a quick little button mashing thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But doing well does give you a bit of an edge in the actual matches themselves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It plays very similar to the other Wrestling Games we've seen like Nintendo is pro wrestling, or over on our sister series 'Chronturbo' humans fire pro wrestling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can punch and kick by using the A and B buttons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when you get up close to your opponent, you can execute a number of grappling, moves and throws. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object being to wear down your opponent stamina and then pin him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The one truly novel feature here is the constant commentary from the announcer who in the U.S. gets a [pretty] ugly makeover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enthusiastically described the app And as it's happening. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the funny thing is, is actually, it's kind of difficult to read what he's saying while you're playing the game, because you're busy focusing on what you're doing, rather than reading the stuff at the bottom of the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm thinking that Tecmo (knowing that these games Robin played in groups of more than two) put in the commentary in order to give some entertainment value to the kids when it wasn't actually their turn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The other cool feature is that Tecmo World Wrestling has these cinematic cutscenes when perform a special move. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is, sort of, like the slam dunk animations found in Basketball Games at the time, though Tecmo gives them a certain amount of "Ninja Gaiden"-esque cinematic flair. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another interesting and, sort of, annoying addition is that your opponent (once his health is down really low) starts cheating like crazy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Suddenly starts hammering you with aggressive attacks one after the other. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All in all, it's a [pretty] good Wrestling Game, though not tech, most most successful Sports Game by a longshot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Japan, it doesn't seem very well remembered, belonging to that special class of FamiCom games that don't have their own jobs. His Wikipedia page. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't we've we've taken over a follow-up with the C Corp despite putting out tons and tons of other Sports Games over the next few years. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Idol Hakkenden 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 September 14 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Natsume 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Towachiki 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next up is a game from our good friends at cheeky. The guys from those goofy 'Sherlock Holmes' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might remember that first one wherever a pedestrian And went around shooting guns randomly for no reason. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they also did that horrible horrible 'Garfield' game from "...Episode 44". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, "Idol Hakkenden" is a hell of a lot better than those games because it was built by Natsumi who are of course, mostly known for the 'Harvest Moon' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was a very early Natsumi title, the second we've seen on 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And even at this early age, they were producing some [pretty] high-quality work, at least in terms of graphics and music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we get this charming as all heck intro here, which is actually going to be the most interesting part of this game for the viewers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because "Idol Hakkenden" is yet another goddamn menu-based Adventure Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the extremely literate among you have already taken note of the name "Idol Hakkenden" and realized it was a play on Nanos had told me Hopkinton the 19th century Japanese epic novel, whose English name is sometimes rendered as a dog Chronicles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've already seen games based on Nando's tell me that kendon but this one is a bit different. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It concerns eight young ladies, but the character you play is named Erica. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The other seven girls will appear at various times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of them Hoshi me (this lady here) serves as kind of your sidekick. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In almost every detective Adventure Game you have some kind of sidekick who follows you around and you can ask them questions and that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hoshi fills the role here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, in the game, the other seven girls make appearances as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a nerdy scientist, type girl, a motorcycle gang girl, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As an all these type of games, you need to talk to various people move to various locations get items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of the items I found while playing this included a candy and a ticket to the aquarium. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At some point, you're going to need to enter that aquarium and sing a song to a sea otter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a few times in this game where they'll sing a song, the result being this brief musical interlude. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All together, there are six songs in idle ockenden. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now Japanese Wikipedia considers idle Kingdom to be, sort of, a follow-up to the first Natsumi game we covered Toho Kanban Roku, which was a crazy ass time traveling Adventure Game involving Marco Polo (cover that back in "Chrontendo ... 37") and which also had some musical regressions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently Natsumi was, sort of, developing a house style when it came to these Adventure Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, unfortunately, we'll [only] be seeing one more Tortuga game and 'Chrontendo' but plenty of Natsumi games and hopefully they'll be a bit more exciting than this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tanigawa Koji no Shogi Shinan III 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 September 14 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, we've got two games from the record label Pony Canyon today, and they are about as different as two games can possibly be. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First up is "Tanigawa Koji no 'Shogi' Shinan III", which is honestly the third game in the Shoji Learning Series that bears the name of Koji Tanigawa, the 'Shogi' master. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the first game in the series was never-released for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, it was an M.S.X. game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Show machine in two was released with the F.D.S. And now the third game It's a regular old cartridge release. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No idea who developed this, but it's a [pretty] standard looking 'Shogi' game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have regular head-to-head 'Shogi' versus a computer or versus another person. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Showbie is, of course, an Asian game that's actually close related to Chess, the rules are a bit different. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are a few other options here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can watch, sort of, a pre-recorded 'Shogi' match. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is supposed to give you tips for your strategy and playing shows. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also a couple odd variations on 'Shogi'. Like this one where you play it but with all the same pieces. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or even stranger there's a slot machine version in which use a slot machine thing to choose which pieces you can move that turn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess Anyway, it was a [pretty] good year for Tanigawa. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from this game coming out, he actually won the big 'Shogi' Grandmaster tournament again, but he wouldn't win that tournament another time until eight years later. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there wouldn't be another Koji Tanigawa video game in total, the PlayStation 2 era. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is actually the last game that we'll see from him and content. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Marusa no Onna 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 September 19 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have some genuinely strange game say but here's one that blows my mind. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 From Capcom. It's "Marusa no Onna", a menu-based Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is certainly not the first Adventure Game we've seen from Capcom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Samurai Sword" came out in late 1988 but that one had, sort of, a typical Fantasy theme to it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Russa no owner is quite a bit different. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now we've seen video games based on comics, on animated T.V. shows, on live action T.V. shows, on movies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most of the FamiCom games like In this room films are some kind of action or Science-Fiction movie, something that younger people will be familiar with. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But far and away the unlikeliest source I've seen for a game so far in 'Chrontendo' is this one here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Brusa no onah the 1987 international hit movie by Judo itami its English language title is a taxing woman. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the director of Tommy was becoming a huge film sensation in Japan in the mid-1980s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 His 1984 movie, the funeral won all kinds of awards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He followed up the funeral with another movie called tampopo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And after that, a taxing woman. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S. in the '80s. These three movies were probably the most well-known Japanese films by a contemporary director, or maybe actually the [only] well-known films by a contemporary Japanese director. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They used to show them all the time on cable TV. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thing is a texting woman is a completely adult film. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's an arthouse black comedy about a middle aged female tax collector, played by the directors wife. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 She goes after a business Who are cheating on their taxes? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Off the top of my head? I really can't think of a less likely candidate for a video game adaptation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Can you imagine playing an S game about a tax fraud investigation? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. equivalent would be I don't know. Maybe Hannah and Her Sisters the video game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One strange thing is that the box art uses the artwork from the poster for the sequel marusia on it too. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So despite its odd subject matter, Marisa Anna plays out just like every other Japanese menu-based Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have the standard menu options moved, look, speak, examine use and the last command is others. (Sort of a miscellaneous command). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the structure more or less conforms to other detective type Adventure Games, even though you're not really technically speaking a detective. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead of trying to solve the murder you're trying to catch people committing tax fraud. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game starts out with you in your office or you talk to your boss log in new computer, you know real exciting stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you exit the office, you can move around on the streets and travel various locations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is usually done by entering a train station and then taking the train to some other part of town. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your first destination is the Pachinko parlor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So essentially here he talked to folks, get information, then head back to your office, look up some stuff on the computer, and then head out elsewhere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Interactions tend to be the typical, repeated use of the 'look' and 'talk' commands. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or sometimes you find it interesting item, or you need to use the 'examine' command. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The odd thing is is I don't really think this is a straight adaptation of the movie, most of which is concerned with the unusual relationship that helps the tax investigator and a hotel owner who she's investigating for tax fraud. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The hotel owner appears in the game as a character (as do several other people from movie) but I don't call a Pachinko parlor or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Don't think is actually an adaptation of the film. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Might be, sort of, like an original story based on the characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So earlier we were wondering why Capcom made a game based on such a strange movie for a video game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps they were aiming for a more mature non-gaming audience. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But also, you know, this movie was massively successful and critically Acclaimed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, as we're Tommy's movies in general at this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A taxing woman won nine Japanese Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And his earlier movie, the funeral did [pretty] much the same thing a couple years earlier. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, I think about just every economy film of this era earned multiple Japanese Academy Awards and nominations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Tommy was just such a huge presence that somehow one of those movies got me into a video game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Interestingly enough, we'll actually see another economy related game later in 1989. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tommy was an actress before became a director and Capcom in a game or movie acted and called's Home. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this game is actually much more well-known in the West and loosen the owner. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we'll be covering it a few episodes down the road. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ultima: Seisha he no Michi 🇯🇵 // Ultima: Quest of the Avatar 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 September 20 🇯🇵 // 1990 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Origin | Infinity | Atelier Double 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 // FCI 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And going back to a much more standard subject for a video game, we have "Ultima Sasha hieno mici" the second ultimate port for the FamiCom, created originally by Richard Garriott as that super brief intro screen there says, but published by a record label company, Pony Canyon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And some would be epic sounding music here, which is unique to this version because the original Computer version had no music at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather obscure company called soft hand may have had something to do with the music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Ultima' is one of those games where the behind the scenes stuff is a bit confusing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the second 'Ultima' port from Pony Canyon, the first being "Ultima III" in 1987. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like that game ultimacy show, you know me, Chica U.S. released by FCI which was another branch of that huge media company that also contained Pony Canyon and Fuji TV. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1989. These guys were so rich and powerful. They actually hired Ronald Reagan (who had just left the White House) to come to Japan and basically, you know, Bunch of speeches saying how great they were. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if they could acquire him certainly acquiring the N.E.S. rights for Ultima was no big deal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The official release title of the U.S. version was "Ultima: Quest of the Avatar" naturally since 'Quest to the Avatar' was the subtitle of the original U.S. Computer version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there is some kind of story going on here, you're running to a magical Renaissance Festival and get teleported to Britannia by a fortune teller. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is [pretty] much what passed to our plot in 1980s R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ultima four goes about character creation a little bit differently than most western R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't directly choose your class and you can't play as different races. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no elves or dwarves here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead, you answer some questions about your personal values and then get assigned to a particular character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are the typical fighter, Paladin, made, but also some more off-the-wall stuff like Shepard or Tinker. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know if this is the first game to use this form of character creation but it certainly was unusual at the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which character you play as will decide which city is start off at. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This part a little confusing since you exit nor Britain's Castle in the outside, but the building that you see there is not the castle you just exited. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Somehow the moment you step outside the castle gates, you instantaneously get teleported halfway around the world and ended up outside your hometown. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So that little town you see there is actually jelen, the hometown of the fighters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you might be like, Whoa, where'd the council go? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Where am I? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each character's hometown is devoted to a particular virtue. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jellen is devoted to valor and everyone is a fighter just like I am here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kind of weird when you think about it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, what happens to the guys who aren't into valor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Down, kick them out or kill them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's a town full of mages, one full of paladins, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Inside you have your typical ultimate shops. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a tavern in various N.P.C.s will drop cryptic hints about where certain things are located. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And other people your hairs you will often find N.P.C.s hiding in corners and slightly inaccessible places, so snooping around the talent is vital. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, "Dragon Quest II" use this idea as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hold on before was originally released on the Apple II around Christmas 1985. The same time the N.E.S. was being test marketed in New York City, and slightly prior to 'Dragon Quest' being released on the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Afterwards, it was ported to many, many other computer systems, and for years was considered to be perhaps one of the best Computer Games ever created. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Was, sort of, like the equivalent of "Dragon Quest III" for Western R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it was far bigger, more involved had more characters and dialogue than all the earlier ultimate games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was, sort of, considered to be the game where R.P.G. is grew up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead of simply revolving around killing off the evil wizard at the bottom of the dungeon. Ultima four was about creating a whole world and a culture for you For you to explore. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, the game was considered revolutionary, at the time, since the main object If it didn't involve defeating some kind of evil Final boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is no final boss and ultimate for! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though in practice this doesn't really change things much about the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When it's the same old 'run around and kill monsters' and 'get money and experience', 'better weapons', 'explore dungeons', et cetera. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In most R.P.G.s he reached the end of the final dungeon and then battle some kind of evil wizard or monster or something and save the universe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here you reach the end of the final dungeon and then... you won! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's it! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Game Over! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Congratulations! you're the Avatar! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And being the avatar means that you were very moral person despite having killed tons and tons of creatures throughout the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But that's okay, you can kill and still be virtuous because you're [only] killing you know, bad guys. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, looting the corpses is okay if you've killed someone, but stealing from living people is bad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So yeah, I guess quest from the avatar totally teaches some important moral lessons like kill all the witnesses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You guys ever noticed how every R.P.G. takes place in a hold up? ground state. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some games will even penalize you from backing away from violent confrontations like you will lose money or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Video games do teach valuable life lessons like making sure that every fight that you get into ends and violent death. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Combat is a lot like "Ultima III"; you enter this special combat screen, and each side takes turn performing app actions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But characters do not have targeted weapons or magic must actually step towards the enemy until they're adjacent then attack. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Frequently, you're just moving your character one step return. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That actually will often take longer than the actual fighting apart. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's range weapons and spells are very handy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another way This differs from Japanese R.P.G. is like 'Dragon Quest' or "Final Fantasy" is your Hit Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In those games, you always start out with like five Hit Points and all usually Level Up after two battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you have to be really really careful at the beginning of the game because it's so easy to get killed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you'll do a bit of fighting and then healing and and so on, until you're strong enough to venture out To the next town. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On ultimate, I started out with 300 hp. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I fought battle after battle and never had to even remotely worry about dying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Leveling-Up is something that requires traveling all the way to Lord Britain's castle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's none of this, sort of, constant improvement and progression that you see in J.R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what exactly do you do an ultimate? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How do you play the game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's, sort of, boils down to a bunch of fetch quests technically. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, you need to find some other party members. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In each town you'll find a real cruel character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned earlier, each town is populated by a specific class. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, for example, you can recruit a Druid in you a Tinker and might knock and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some classes are certainly more useful than others. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from getting your four party members together, you'll need to grind for cash and get some decent weapons, especially bows for ranged attacks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then it's [pretty] much all about wandering the earth in search of... stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Specifically, you need to find the eight Runes of virtue. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (That's a rune as In the letters of the alphabet.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But in the game these ruins seem to be like some sort of stones (maybe wood ruined with runes written on them or something). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are hidden about the various towns, others are squirreled away in Harvard rich places. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In pieces often drop hints about the location of this kind of stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Use these runes to unlock the eight shrines of virtue. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You then have to meditate (which does something - I forget what exactly). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also need to master the virtues by performing (or sometimes not performing) certain actions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In some are really easy; to increase Valerie's and to fight in lots of battles, not right away. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To increase compassion and to give a Gold piece to a beggar when you meet one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For humility, apparently, you can just talk to lots of people. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At some point, you'll also need to venture into the dungeon and find each of the eight stones of virtue, I guess, to match the set of rooms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To use the stones to get some keys and you also need to get a bell, book, and candle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And once you've got all that crap, you can then enter the final dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you actually beat the game by being asked a quiz about the eight virtues. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So ultimate four is a [pretty] weird game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, the whole idea of an R.P.G. based on virtue was supposedly inspired by parents complaining about violence in video games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it still involves a whole lot of killing, lots of random battles, and stealing people's loot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the structure is kind of weird as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The World Map as a huge sprawling place with the eight towns mentioned. Plus, you know a number of other locations. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Travel is mostly done through these teleportation portals called moon gates. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Essentially how this works at a particular spot. A magical portal will briefly appear when the two moons are phased up correctly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you're on the World Map, you can see the moons on the upper left corner. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can [only] travel to certain locations from any given moon date, so you may have to make several trips in using moon gates to get to the place where you want to be. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is all [pretty] confusing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though. In the U.S. at least the game came with a huge manual (like 80 pages), including this handy chart For using the moon gates. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, there's some maps of the world and of individual towns, descriptions of weapons, armor, herbs, all kinds of tips. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's virtually a mini walkthrough guide. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other ways in which ultimate four is kind of strange. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mean on one hand, it takes place on this huge world full of N.P.C.s and exploration, and is in many ways completely nonlinear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, it's very strangely structured. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, you go from city to city, picking up party members and looking for some runes and stones. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are dungeons of course, but they're all connected together. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll probably have to Level Up quite a bit before you can even start exploring the dungeons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So most people will play it today we'll get all the rooms and port items first while building up through virtue stats and running for Gold and Leveling-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then going to the dungeons getting those virtue stones and finishing up the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it's not like "Dragon Quest III" or "Final Fantasy II" or mother or "Phantasy Star II" or any of those games where there's some kind of narrative structure that has new parts of the world opening up and becoming Not consecutively more difficult, with dungeons and mini-Bosses each getting a bit more difficult as you progress to the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Man, "Final Fantasy II", there's this tightly constructed narrative, it's always driving you forward. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead here you can wander around wherever you want. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you, sort of, have to do the dungeon at the very end because it takes that long get strong enough to survive the dungeons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the game (like I said), does feel very strangely paced, compared to most J.R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's take a look at the dungeons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ultima four handles in a [pretty] odd way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You actually enter them from Lord Britain's castle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you found this key, which can [only] be purchased in a couple of towns which are accessible by ship [only]. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the ships can [only] be obtained once you reach a certain level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So like as I pointed out earlier, you It's impossible to actually get to the dungeons until you've reached that level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Dungeons are, of course, completely dark unless you use a torch or smell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then go up or down the floor by using this annoying ladder interface. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first dungeon is [pretty] big But you need to go all the way to the bottom floor in order to access on all of it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, you'll find entrances to the other dungeons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like I mentioned, they're all connected into some sort of super dungeon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's a plenty of random encounters at this point, but nothing too tough. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is not a completely faithful part of the original. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Part of the issue is due to hardware limitations, they had cut out quite a bit of stuff from the Computer version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Computer version was spread across multiple disks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The dialogue choices with mpcs have been greatly simplified and reduced to more standard J.R.P.G. 'talk' options like it happened every other J.R.P.G. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, the ugly stick figures from the Computer version have been converted into your typical squat Little 'Dragon Quest' guys. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At one point ultimate four was considered to be the crowning achievement of Computer Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And even today, some folks will still call it the greatest R.P.G. ever made. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 More than likely, you'll probably enjoy something like Earthbound or "Final Fantasy IV" or 'Dragon Quest' five more than ultimate for. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But we can't ignore its historical significance. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you're some kind of video game story, and you'll definitely need to investigate this particular game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Chuuka Taisen 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 September 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito | Disco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've not seen much from Taito lately, probably. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yet a few games out earlier in the year such as a port of "Operation Wolf", and there was a Baseball Game a couple months ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then today we have yet another Arcade port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This time it's the Chinese themed Horizontal Shoot-'em-Up "Chuuka Taisen" (known in the U.S. as "Cloud Master", though this FamiCom version never had a U.S. release). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What can we say about this game that we haven't already said? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a "Gradius" inspired Shooter, I guess? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, it has a completely different power-ups. system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It does, sort of, feel kind of like a lame "Gradius" knockoff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those of you with strong memories will know this is the third time we've seen this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was mentioned very briefly in the 1980s Arcade games Round-Up, and the Arcade game version was much nicer looking in terms of graphics and had better sound. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the backgrounds (inspired by Chinese painting) looked [pretty] good. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hardly a classic game though. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in "Chronsega ... 8" we covered the Sega Master System port, which looked quite a bit uglier and didn't impress me very much why it's got to back then. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Master System version was released sometime in 1989, and did not get a Japanese release since Sega had already pulled the plug on the Master System in Japan by that time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now we have the FamiCom game which still looks [pretty] poopy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was ported (I think) by something called disco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 According to Game Developer Research Institute disco was a subdivision of title originally created to sell appliances. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But later the name was found in the credits of some title ns ports. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you need a refresher course on this game, well, you know you shoot waves of enemies such as soup bowls and turtles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and look, here's a mini-Boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you defeat him, you'll get to enter a shop of sorts. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no money or anything and you could Tyson. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You simply get to pick one of the power-ups every time you went to our shop. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This replaces your existing power-up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from what you get in the shop, you can also power-up your main weapon in a very non-spectacular fashion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's a three way shot, for example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the end of level you'll fight Big boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's about it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's [pretty] short, very basic Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was impressed with it when I covered on Sega and I'm certainly not impressed with it now. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 The Chrontendo 1989 Arcade Round-Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, we're almost through 1989 so I guess we better finally get around to doing the 1989 Arcade Round-Up. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Intro: Arcade Games Were Still Huge ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep after the video game crash and during the height of Nintendo mania Arcade games were still huge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while we were seeing the number of arcades in the U.S. diminish, there were still tons of places to play these - movie theaters, pizza joints, bowling alleys, miniature Golf courses, and dedicated spots like Chucky cheese and other amusement venues. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what kind of Arcade games came out in 1989? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, not a whole lot different from those 1988. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This era was around the height of the whole militarization era video games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the wake of the huge success of movies like Rambo and Top Gun all kinds of games with similar themes were created. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So in 1989, we had tons of contrast Run-'n'-Guns, as well as lots of Shoot-'em-Ups where you pilot as a jet fighter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The dominant genres at this time appear to be Run-'n'-Guns and the relative the Beat-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're, sort of, at a Golden age of Beat-'em-Ups here, the huge upswing in the genre being triggered by the success of "Double Dragon". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also Shoot-'em-Ups remain very popular as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's also of course, quite a few driving sports and puzzle type games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Sega ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sega in many ways remains the King of the Arcade despite simultaneously supporting the Master System, Genesis, and preparing for the release of the Game Gear in 1990. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Turbo Outrun ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They were actually putting out a [pretty] amazing amount of product when you think about it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Many of Sega has high-end Arcade games last few years to use their sprite scaling technology. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Turbo "OutRun" was the first equal to sales 986 hit and actually sold was sold as an "OutRun" conversion kit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was on the old "OutRun" board. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The course here is based on actual map of the United States with you traveling from coast to coast. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not terribly different than "OutRun" (vehicle upgrades have been added for one) but it's still a very nice looking game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Super Monaco Grand Prix ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Super Monaco GP was technically a more advanced racer using Singh as export (the same board used for "AfterBurner" and thunderblade). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Way back around 1980 sec released a couple of top down Monaco GP Arcade games sweis poses a very belated sequel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Very Nice use of carefully layered sprites and backgrounds to create a 3D fill. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Line of Fire ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Line of Fire also using the Sega export. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a military themed rail Shooter which used to mounted positional guns. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather than a standard gallery Shooters something like "Operation Wolf". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is more along the lines of Panzer Dragoon in the camera is constantly moving on a set of rails. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, you're driving a Jeep giving it, sort of, a Disneyland dark ride type of field. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why no fire really goes overboard with the explosions and flying objects and huge 'damage' text popping up, making it feel, sort of, like one of the more frantic rail Shooters that came out later in the '90s. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Crack Down ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the System 24 board was its successor to seikos famous System 16 boards, but wasn't really used in a ton of interesting games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Crack down. (Aside from having this absolutely amazing intro) was a bit unusual for Sega. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It featured 2-Player Co-Op with a separate mini screen for each player. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your objective is to go around planning a set number of bombs to blow up an enemy base, and it feels kind of like a variation on alien syndrome. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Shadow Dancer ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much more well-known was the game that came out for the brand new system 18 board shadowdancer the sequel to 1987 Shinobi. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shadowdancer doesn't really change the formula too much. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You now have a dog companion that you can use to stick on enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like crack down the game revolved around bombs, in this case, defusing them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now if you've ever played the Genesis game shadowdancer you'll find the Arcade version is [pretty] much a completely different game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was also the last Shinobi Arcade game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Golden Axe ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Moving a step back technologically we have Sega his most beloved game of 1989 Golden Axe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I love the way the logo incorporates the shape of the weapons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now you too among three characters the the classic, sort of, trio of slow but strong, fast and weak, or balanced. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Golden Max is very much one of the classic games of the post "Double Dragon" Beat-'em-Up era. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike many of Sega earlier Beat-'em-Up so you can move in two dimensions instead of just one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have a variety of tacks and even magic at your disposal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also kill mounted enemies and then hijack the rides. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can also beat the s--- out of elves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Totally top-notch stuff and definitely one of the top games in 1989. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Cyber Police ESWAT ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other say Sega games of interest are e SWAT, which is kind of like Shinobi with guns, but with a twist. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a basic walk and shoot type game (feels [pretty] similar to "RoboCop" actually), and the story was lifted directly from "RoboCop". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now after killing three bosses, you will get the SWAT Robo armor, which looks like it should turn you into a walking death machine but is actually a little lame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like shadowdancer at God just USB port, which completely redid the game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸M.V.P. Baseball ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now Sega did put out a few Sports Games for arcades. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is MVP Baseball, which is most notable for the goofy art style and unappealing character designs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To me everything here looks, sort of, like it's in like the British or European comic card style with those weird bug eyes and oddly shaped heads. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Looks kinda like the guy is from the lemmings games or something like that. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Bay Route ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, a bit obscure is Bay route, which was actually developed by Sunsoft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, they route is one of the most boring video game names ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It sounds like a Driving Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it's not; It's a straight up "Contra" clone sentence, either some kind of post-apocalyptic wasteland or some war zone that's been torn to pieces by airstrikes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The title screen also just mentions hostages. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's so Condor like that it actually has a Spread shot weapon. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Namco ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so they're Singaporean. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But what about the other big guns of the Arcade scene? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well Namco for one didn't really offer too much of interest in 1989. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Burning Force ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Burning force has a great name, and a rather striking it tracks bring. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game itself as a "Space Harrier"-like Shooter with sprite based 3D effects. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It uses the Namco System 2 board which was first introduced in 1987 with the Racing Game "Final Lap". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The system to do various forms of sprite depilation, but the effects here are nowhere near as spectacular as the stuff that Sega was doing at this time. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Valkyrie no Densetsu ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, of note is Namco's Daltrey no Densetsu a sequel to the FamiCom game called Valkyrie no boeken which we covered way back in "Chrontendo Episode 9". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was the same episode in which we covered "Metroid". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now Namco does not hesitate to use the system to his abilities as often as possible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sprites are always shrinking and growing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is a [pretty] good combination of shooting action and R.P.G. like characteristics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 N.P.C.s will give you new abilities, chest one pop out loot, and you collect money whenever you kill something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll actually see this game later when it's poured into the P.C. Engine. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Marvel Land ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not quite as good as Marvel land a [pretty] simplistic Platformer, but one which is actually [pretty] cute, and have some rather thumping music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot of other Namco games have this candy colored cutie style at the time. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Dangerous Seed ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namco boy didn't get quite into the whole military Shooter thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though they did have some shoot ups like dangerous seed, which had a red logo though the game itself is [pretty] similar to Dragon Spirit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You often find yourselves fighting giant spider things or creepy little frogs and that sort of stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later on, there'll be a Mega Drive port of this. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Blast Off ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even less interesting is blast off which is quite frankly, one of the most generic looking maps I've ever seen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Technically, it's a sequel to Bostonian. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it does have these, sort of, rather slick, clean looking graphics features and nice 3D like effects, such as this rotating space station day. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the game itself seems [pretty] boring. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Taito ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Twin Hawk ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now title, on the other hand go fully into the military Shooters genre, in particular, through their games developed by toy plan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Twin Hawk is a fine example of this, sort of, a successor to the 1987 game of Flying Shark. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You control a small underpowered World War II style plane engaging an entire army with lots of tanks, even tank bosses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I found that to be [pretty] hard. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Hellfire ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hellfire sounds like a World War II Shooter but it's actually more like a "Gradius" clone, the one with a much more normal power of scheme, and rather unmemorable, generic space station type back rounds. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 His bosses just like the greediest shoot the core boss [only] he has four cores. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not a bad little game, but there's really not much here that's gonna make it stand out from the crowd. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Cadash ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're not playing games, let's take a look at Kaddish. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is yet another attempt to introduce R.P.G. elements into an Arcade game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You get to choose your character class, (I foolishly chose major). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then it's off to the side-scrolling R.P.G. action. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have Gold and experience, stabs like strength and agility, all that stuff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yet it is a very linear side-scrolling Action Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kennish is not bad by any means. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the whole idea of, sort of, converting a traditional Arcade game into an R.P.G. is one that a lot of games experiment with at this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the results were always interesting but mostly not exceptional. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Master of Weapon ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Master of weapon is a Science-Fiction themes Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One bizarre coincidence is the date listed here is September 11 19.xx. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this game you can find and shoot these big duel skyscrapers which collapse or World Trade Center style. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than that, it's really not very memorable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it is, sort of, an ugly looking game which, by the way, later about poured into the Genesis. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Darius 2 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now Gary is to is well it's tickled derrius that big wide game that uses the crazy three screen cabinet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now most areas two cabinets scale this back to a relatively modest two screens. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is two is [pretty] much just like derrius one as far as I can tell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You shoot a bunch of spaceships that are shaped like fish. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Battle Shark ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also battle shark a submarine first-person Shooting Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nice looking graphics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Cool fish. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Can't say the grim as game is that great. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now take a good look at this because this one will never be ported to any 16-bit systems. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Special Criminal Investigation ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Special Criminal Investigation is the sequel to "Chase HQ". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] cool intro is yet tear off your fancy sports car to rescue some kidnap victims. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why are people always getting kidnapped in video games? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 NCI is essentially just "Spy Hunter" down in the "OutRun"-style (ramming cars off the road shooting rocket launchers, you know, that kind of stuff). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Cameltry ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Title also released a number of relatively gentler games, such as the strangely named the camel tree, in which you navigate a maze by revolving the world around you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though I clearly did not have the controls emulated correctly here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Are there other Arcade games based on this concept? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's quite unusual. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ported to the Super Nintendo by the way. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Don Doko Don ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Dawn doko Dawn is a gentle little Platformer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while it's not a "bubble Bobble" sequel technically, it's very much in the same vein, except that you smash things with mallets rather than capture them with bubbles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Was actually ported to the FamiCom in 1990. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And maybe and maybe due to the whole mushroom thing got released as a bogus Mario game on pirate carts. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Zero Wing ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while we're here let's check out another Shooter that to a plan made which was perhaps Not done per title, the famous "zero wing". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is actually not quite clear as to whether title released this or not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of the cabinets in the U.S.A. Williams on them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I don't see titles name anywhere on this so maybe to plan or lease to themselves in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not 100% Sure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this is a cool little "Gradius"-style Shooter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I'm sorry to disappoint you but the cutscene that contains those famous lines of broken English do not exist in the Arcade "zero wing". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nope. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That particular cutscene was created, especially for the Mega Drive Genesis version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously will encounter zero when again in from Sega. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Data East ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, let's check out some of the other companies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Data ees released a slew of mostly forgotten Action Games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Vapor Trail: Hyper Offense Formation ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Vapor trail hyper offense formation has cool music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not to be confused with the rush album, of course, vapor trail is a [pretty] decent but not very original Shooter. For you below bunch of tanks and enemy jet fighters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh look, here's the standard giant tank boss at some of the games used. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Act-Fancer: Cybernetick Hyper Weapon ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The awkwardly named act fan sir cybernetic hyper weapon is a Horizontal Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What would they the east and the word hyper? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one? I think it's [pretty] obscure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't believe it ever got any, sort of, home court. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Sly Spy // Secret Agent ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, now this is just silly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You're a spy named Agent 000. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taking on the council for world domination. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're not very subtle about it, are they? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's a [pretty] cool beginning where he has, sort of, a midair shootout over Washington DC. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Slice by is a rather colorful Action Game which is [pretty] fast-paced and tends to throw you from one set piece to another in a fashion quite similar to the Uncharted games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, was ported to computer systems like the Commodore 64 Amiga, but not forgotten. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Fighting Fantasy // Hippodrome ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So fighting fantasy is a [pretty] violent and weird Fighting Game with Mortal Kombat style plot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's some wild fighting tournament going on where you battle a bunch of crazy monsters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] dark and bloody game which employs some very similar fighting mechanics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He can barely even be called a Fighting Game in the Street Fighter sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also goes by the name Hippodrome, which is rather an appropriate Some say Hippodrome is a chariot racing stadium. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe they were a confusing a Hippodrome, where they call a sim. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Midnight Resistance ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Midnight resistance has this insane intro. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What does this mean? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No idea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the game begins with the ghost riding off a jeep. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's [pretty] hifi. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, midnight resistance is a [pretty] cool little "Contra" knockoff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Guy with a headband. Then machine gun kills army dudes and tanks. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Capcom ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Strider ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Moving on to more prestigious releases, we have Strider from Capcom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not so sure Strider was a huge hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It wasn't one of those games like "Double Dragon" are Street Fighter that used to see in every single bowling alley with a huge crowd around it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But those are reputation as being one of the absolute best Action Games of the era. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's easy to see why. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's fast-paced, tons of over the top action, utterly ridiculous bosses, Creative level design. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Strider is basically a nonstop roller coaster of a video game with antastic graphics and sound. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, let's just look at this! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These dudes become a giant snake! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What the hell? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And basically the whole game is kind of like this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now obviously, we've already seen the N.E.S. version of Strider which was a completely different game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I play Strider with Golden Axe as being the top for Arcade games of this year. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Final Fight ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And another of the top four games and 99 must be this one final fight. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 1989 through 1990 was, sort of, the Golden Age of Beat-'em-Ups and Final Fight is one of the absolute high points of the genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, we have a kidnapped girlfriend slash daughter, and you need to walk across town and rescue her. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like Golden Axe or three characteristics strong, fast, and balanced. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have an attack button and a jump button and a special movability where you press both buttons at once. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you probably heard, Final Fight was originally supposed to be a sequel to Street Fighter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Guy (the balanced character here is) basically just reviewing an orange outfit instead of a white one, (a.k.a. Ken). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while the release of "Street Fighter II" in 1991 [pretty] much wiped out the Beat-'em-Up genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For a couple years Final Fight and ilk ruled the arcades. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Dynasty Wars ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now another interesting Capcom Beat-'em-Up his dynasty wars. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I probably should have mentioned this in the episode of content no will recover "Destiny of an Emperor" But this is the Arcade game version of that game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Japan they both went by the same name Tinchy will carry. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Along with Strider, this was part of some multimedia plan Capcom ad with a company called Mota mia kikaku. A Manga Studio. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each property consists of a manga, and Arcade game, and original FamiCom game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike Strider, Tinchy will curl was an adaptation of an existing comic, not a new character. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And basically, it's just The Three Kingdoms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can play as one of the three brothers or Xiao Yun, who acted as a general under the obey. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There would be both an Arcade sequel and a FamiCom sequel later. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Area 88 // U.N. Squadron ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 No cap columns main Shoot-'em-Up series was the '1942' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But here's another military theme Shooter from them area '88 or un Squadron as was called in the U.S. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese version was based on the area at manga. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the weird thing was area it was actually one of the very first longest to get an English release in the U.S. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the mango is actually available and readable in English in the United States in 1989. But they still release the game under a different name. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Possibly this was a licensing issue. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Super Nintendo version is much better known and is considered to be one of the best Shoot-'em-Ups on that system. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Capcom Baseball ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so what else do we have from Capcom? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, there was Capcom Baseball, which went for the goofy, cartoony style rather than aiming for a realistic Baseball Game style. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing too exciting here. I'm afraid. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Konami ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Bottom of the Ninth ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami was more known for Sports Games, and Capcom was and they went the exact opposite approach with their Baseball Game bottom of the night, almost going for a photo realistic effect. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Check out the animation on this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or these trays from film footage of real life Baseball players? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Konami is trying to make this look like a televised Baseball Game or something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A few years later, they would revive bottom of the Knights as a game for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Gradius III ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now all admit "Gradius III" as a game sounds [pretty] intriguing, especially after the sheer awesomeness of radius two, but this is actually a bit of a letdown. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Radius three isn't bad; it just, sort of, feels like more of the same. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like instead of Fire Dragon here are some sand dragons and Sam Lyons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This rather famously was ported to the Super Nintendo where was one of the very earliest titles for that system, and was intended to show off the squid Nintendo's graphical muscle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this comic, sort of, abandoned radius until the PlayStation era, or at least the excellent game "Gradius" guidance in 1997. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Missing In Action ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, looking back into the past instead of the future is missing an action, a sequel of sorts to "Rush'n' Attack". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now back when we saw the home version of "Rush'n' Attack" in 'Chrontendo', I liked it quite a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was one of the best Action Games on the family home at that time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the post "Contra" era, however, it feels a little dull. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe You saw this in the Arcade next to Strider, you wouldn't have given it a second glance. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, when you think of Konami in the early '90s, you might think of Beat-'em-Ups, particularly those involving licensed characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here's one game that instantly springs to mind. "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" the Arcade game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the vein of Strider and "Ninja Gaiden". TMT existed as two separately developed games, one for the N.E.S. and one for the arcades. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We, of course, already covered the N.E.S. version a few episodes back. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Gigantic Arcade cabinets that could accommodate for players were, sort of, becoming a more common sight Arcade at this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And TMT was one such game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A perfectly logical choice in this case, since there were four turtles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this certainly was not the best beam up game of 1989. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it came at just the right time as the turtles were becoming massively popular. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in 1990, of course, we'd see the movie and a flood of Ninja Turtles games released over the next few years. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Crime Fighters ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not as well-known for obvious reasons is the rather busy Our crime fighters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Classic over the top intro involving not a kidnapped girlfriend but a whole bunch of ladies captured by some crime boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As such games go, it's just okay action wise, but the appeal lies in being so damned weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can attack enemies with straight razors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's [pretty] cool, I guess. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then there's stuff like this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And lots of beating up punk rockers in the grimy streets of New York, I assume. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You just look at this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's subtle, but the posters of the women on the subway are actually animated. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Crime fighters is bizarre enough be worth a look and actually ended up getting two sequels. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Block Hole // Quarth ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami also put its finger into the Puzzle Game pie with black hole. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I love the idea of a fleet of "Tetris"-like blocks carving a path of death and destruction throughout the galaxy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This would show throws in shooting elements into the falling block genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to fill in these shapes as they fall. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I really don't think anybody remembers this game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Atari Games ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸KLAX ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's a Puzzle Game people do remember. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's the '90s and there's time for clacks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably one of Atari is more successful Arcade games at this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Clacs was very famously created by Mark Akers in a very short period of time after he completed escape from the plan of the robot monsters, which had a very long development time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some sources say the code was written in, quote unquote, a few weeks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Others give a more realistic sounding for months. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, quacks like "Tetris" is an addictive little Puzzle Game that got ported to every system under the sun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Including in 1990, the 2600 making it the last official Atari game for that console, even though various unlicensed came out afterwards. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Escape From The Planet Of The Robot Monsters ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other games from Atari in 1989. Included well escape from the plan to the robot monsters of course. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great colorful intro here, sort of, in the vein of '50s Science-Fiction movies and Mars Attacks trading cards. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your mission:. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Port all hostages back to your ship. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Destroy all robots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Red Planet X. alone. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not much remember today, probably because I don't think it actually received any console cords but instead several computer ports to the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum and that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sort of seeing the graphics of the rescued hostages kind of remind me of those in "Metal Slug". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸S.T.U.N. Runner ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some sources say that Atari 3D racer or game hard driving came out in 1989. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But others say 1988 and I covered it in last year's Arcade Round-Up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another game released on the same hardware was stun runner, a futuristic Racing Game, almost kind of like a predecessor to F Zero. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those done runner, Of course, uses polygonal 3D instead of sprites and mode seven. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now obviously by 1989 standards, this is utterly mind blowing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is just so damn fast and smooth looking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes Atari is high-tech experiments worked out and other times like in games like pit fighter they did. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# SNK + Kaneko ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Ikari III: The Rescue ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So sorry SNK down so we're still one year away from the introduction of your stupid beloved neogeo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead, here's some crap SNK put out 1989. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ikari three is a [pretty] weird game and actually feels more like a top down Beat-'em-Up instead of a "Commando"-style Run-'n'-Gun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have some in water Rambo clone on Rambo clone action here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As we see SNK use much bigger be Your sprites than in the prior two games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's still a [pretty] ugly game and lacked any decent ports. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this was, of course, the final 'Ikari Warriors' game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Beast Busters ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright animal lovers, I bet you'll hate this game beast busters in the zombie apocalypse themed shooting gallery game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It also makes use of the very Rare zombies with guns trope. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yet but the zombies are armed and quick on the draw. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also dogs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now I assume these are zombie dogs, not just random vicious dogs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, you shoot a lot of dogs in this game, a whole lot of dogs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So dog lovers beware. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Street Smart ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also SNK is glorious history of ripping off Capcom's Fighting Games begins here with street smart (for the lane Fighting Game that resembles the first Street Fighter). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not very good, but it has some nice details like the backgrounds and crowds. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, the SNK ambulance that hauls away defeated opponents. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Gang Wars ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this insane open is from gang wars which was built by alpha denshi and manufactured by SNK. At least in some territories. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's a standard and [pretty] don't Beat-'em-Up in the "Double Dragon" mode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enemies constantly do this horrible sounding digitized laugh sound effect. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really obnoxious. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the flyer feature an illustration of a guy who has obviously copied from a photo of Jackie Chan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, this game has been [pretty] much long forgotten. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸DJ Boy ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konica was a small game company mostly known for producing the naughty gals panic Arcade games, as well as a few regular games like this one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a roller skating themed Beat-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You play the game on roller skates. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now obviously this makes it, sort of, feel a lot different than most Beat-'em-Ups. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now does this take place in San Francisco? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have a marina, hills visible in the background, streetcars. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Interesting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the most notorious moment is this boss fight right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, this feature is the vocal talents of Wolfman jack, for some reason. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Somehow this ended up getting ported onto the Genesis. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# IREM ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Dragon Breed ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 From IREM Ae have a dragon breed a [pretty] sweet looking horizontal, Shoot-'em-Up and once you write a dragon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The dragon itself appears to be indestructible, so you can use its body as a weapon of sorts. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seems like a [pretty] cool little game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Never put it in the consoles, [only] computers. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸XMultiply ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah, here we have x multiply, not officially a secret art hype, but, sort of, the spiritual successor to that game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great looking title screen with creepy suspiria like music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also that x and infinity symbol logo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That and the name itself greatly resemble that of the Yellow Magic Orchestra album x multiples. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is basically R-Type with a twist. Your ship has these crazy alarms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They resemble old radio style options except they're attached to these arms and they move around as you move your ship. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, moving backwards will cause the arms to move in front of you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Little arms actually absorb enemy projectiles of which there are a lot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's a [pretty] cool little mechanic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And despite not being very well-known, it's multipliers actually one of the ironies better Shooters, one that's much better than... R-Type two. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸R-Type II ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite this cool intro, this game isn't quite as awesome as the first archetype. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some sources say this released in 1990, but main says 1989 so I'll go ahead and stick with it. Stick this into this year's Round-Up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's hard to say exactly what's wrong with R-Type. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's competently made, but, sort of, lacks the freshness of the first one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's just really not that much new here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Gradius III", this kind of port to the Super Nintendo a couple years down the road. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Legend of Hero: Tonma ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just a wee bit more obscure is legend of hero Toma which doesn't really resemble the iron style at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a cute little Platformer, kinda like a "Wonder Boy" type game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will come up later on the P.C. Engine and even godhra U.S. released on TurboGrafx. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Smaller Publishers ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Arch-Rivals ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The once mighty midway was still plugging along. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point who are more well-known for Pinball Games rather than video games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One notable title this year was arch rivals. A cartoony looking Basketball Game is mostly known now for being a dry run for NBA Jam. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have a variety of colorful characters you can pick. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game has various animated mini scenes, shattering back boards and that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the very few games here today be ported to the N.E.S. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸WWF Superstars ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now Technos (despite having a massive recent hit with "Double Dragon") didn't put that much out in 1989, a Wrestling Game WWF superstars. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might notice the whole Conan is a trademark of Marvel Comics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right. The Hulk Hogan actually had a license his name from Marvel Comics for quite some time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is obviously fully licensed WWF game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Block Out ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also "Block Out". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is an arcane version of a Computer Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, there were actually two games that came out in 1989 are basically "Tetris" in three dimensions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, truss was created by Pajitnov himself, and "Block Out" was created by a couple of Polish guys. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But hey, "Tetris" was hot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And since the right that game right to that game, we're all completely tied up. "Block Out" was the next best thing. I assume. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Astyanax // Lord of King ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey Sword and Sorcery fans, here's a game for you, "Astyanax" (a.k.a. "Lord of Kings" in Japan), from Jaleco. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this was apparently the belt by icon the guys who worked on Legendary acts for the TurboGrafx. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this looks and plays a lot like that game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, I mentioned this similarity back when we covered legendary acts and 'Chronturbo'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [pretty] sweet game, but sadly, it was never ported to any system big systems [only] getting an N.E.S. port. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Omega Fighter ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A mega fighter isn't utterly generic Shoot-'em-Up from the UPL. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We saw these somewhat interesting atomic Robo kid from them last year. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a rather outdated looking bog-standard Shooter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 UPL would go out of business in a year or two, a victim of the contracting Arcade game scene. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those who two mo Fujisawa of UPL with forming a new company called feel plus. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're still active and codoped law Odyssey and did that No More Heroes sequel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They even did a lot of work on some Dreamcast games for Sega, including a notorious flop called Shenmue. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Wild Fang // Tecmo Knight ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here's a weird ass looking game from Tecmo wild thing called Tecmo. Knight in the U.S. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's original. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know what to say about this other than it looks, sort of, amateurish. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is so ridiculously violent, gory, and over the top that I can actually forgive that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wild Thing is [pretty] absurd. It's a [pretty] obscure game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was never ported anywhere., As far as I know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one's [pretty] weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I guess maybe give it a try. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ⚠️ NSFW Alert ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And last, but definitely least, oh, by the way, here's a not safe for work alert. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Turn off this video. Now if you're at work. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Tokyo Gal ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, it's Tokyo gal from Nietzsche booth zoo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They've made some cool stuff like "Crazy Climber" in years past but they eventually settled into stuff like this sexy Mahjong games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which is exactly what this is. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Conclusion: 1989 Arcade Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And okay, we're finally done... until we reach the 1989. Computer Game round-up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh god. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But one big takeaway of all this is that very few of these games ended up getting any N.E.S. or FamiCom ports. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the last few years games like "Double Dragon" in Gaiden, and all kinds of things ended up on the world's most popular game console. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that is about in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Almost everything here, with a few exceptions that had a home version ended up on the Genesis, the TurboGrafx, or the Super Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Nintendo Entertainment System as a delivery system for home console versions of Arcade games was [pretty] much at an end at this point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, now all this is over with let's go back to where we left off. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hollywood Squares 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 September [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by GameTek 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, let's check out a few of U.S.-[only] games for November. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are actually a lot of non-Japanese titles in November 1989. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we'll need to do some now and then some next time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, this is another one of those Rare-develop games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, it's a game show adaptation published by GameTek. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, we'll be seeing Rare-developed games about every single episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this will actually continue for a while. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So clearly, what we have here is a game version of "Hollywood Square's". A daytime game show that I'm [pretty] sure it's no longer on the air. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The idea was that you play Tic Tac Toe by having the celebrities (or, sort of, C list celebrities) answer questions and then trying to decide if they had the correct answer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Technically, it existed up until the 2000s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But for me, it's impossible to separate this from the Golden era of game show. In the '70s and early '80s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was, sort of, a sister show to the Match Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And both of these feature this, sort of, particular brand of not exactly top tier celebrities whose claim to fame seemed to mostly stem from appearing on these game shows. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, I have no idea what Charles Nelson Reilly did other than the Match Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...win $500. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Did Adam and Eve have a last name?". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ginsburg, I think.". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "No, no.". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "No, they did not have a last name.". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "I agree with you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They did not have a last name. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ace gets the square and $500.". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The competitive aspect of these things is actually, sort of, a minor part of the appeal. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was mostly these goofy celebrity guests constantly making corny jokes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And could check out episodes of these things back in the early '70s. You'll see it was [pretty] much the entertainment world major source of gay actors who are not officially out of the closet, but we're constantly making non-stop sexual innuendos. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 GameTek relates to multiple versions of the "Hollywood Square's" video game, starting with this one here, the Commodore 64 version from 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then, of course, they hired Rare to produce a version for the Nintendo Entertainment System. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While the graphics and characters and music have all been completely changed from the original Computer versions, the basic idea remains the same. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You pick a square and then the person in that Square's ask a question, which they will apply First of all, like a corny joke answer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then they give you their real answer and need to decide whether it's true or false, or rather, whether you agree or disagree with them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you get the correct answer, then you put an X or o in that square. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now GameTek did not license any of the likenesses of any of the celebrities associated with the T.V. shows. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this, sort of, destroys the entire appeal of "Hollywood Square's". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The entire focus of this show was watching guys like Paul Lynde be goofy for half an hour. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here all we have are like this hopelessly lame jokes. and uninteresting trivia questions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the best way to win this game is to play it a few times and start to memorize the answers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's an obvious flaw in these sorts of things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because the very limited number of questions someone who's already played will have a big advantage against someone who hasn't. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, there is very little interest here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's move on to another Rare related game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sesame Street ABC 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 September [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Zippo Games 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hi-Tech Expressions 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So again, we get the standard Rare credit screen, but this game doesn't even have a proper title screen (at least if I can't find it). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead, when we start, we go straight to the selection screen and get a charming little version of the Sesame Street theme song. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As a recall one of my main complaints about "Sesame Street 123" (high-tech first Sesame Street came January 19. Nine) wasn't it didn't use much music from a T.V. show. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here at least we get one memorable song. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, once you actually start the damn game, we find it's just some hastily done minigame collection with Sesame Street characters thrown in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let her go around comprises six variations on the same game and would choose a ferris wheel to well I guess to match letters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You simply press the button when the correct letter is on the bottom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so a ferris wheel which is not the same thing as a merry go round. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Get a dark starless night, the moon reflecting on a mirror like Lake, circus midway. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, what does this have to do with Sesame Street? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Absolutely nothing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, if you get three correct a character will appear and do a little dance. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's Big Bird. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's pokey wants to run Ernie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Damn ponies got some sick loops. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Think that some kind of industrial dance he's doing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or here's a cookie monster and Bert. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, Bert is hella slag. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The second and final game here (and yeah, that's right. There are exactly two minigames on this cartridge. That's a few less than the last high-tech Sesame Street game), his earnings big splash. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now despite the theme of the cart being the alphabet, the developers apparently couldn't come up with a second alphabet themed game, and instead they did this thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object is simply to press the D-Pad over and over until you get the box that points you in the direction you want to go. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you add the next box on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You, sort of, keep adding boxes until you connect Ernie. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game is [pretty] moronic and stupid. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And just like that other Sesame Street game while Rare name appears on the credits it was subcontracted to Zippo games, which is a small English studio run by two brothers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As Game Developers Research Institute Riley puts it this to do folded due to quote unquote Rare not paying them much. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll see a few more Zippo developed games before they disappear in 1991. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the whole cart is simply two rather boring minigame collections. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even little kids would be bored by these things as far as I can tell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What exactly what's the age group these were aimed at? preschoolers? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The letter go round game simply involves determining if two letters are the same. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Isn't really teaching kids what the letters are or what they're called, or what they sound like. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead is just Can you tell the difference between two differently shaped letters? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the back of the box art claims that the bathtub game is a problem solving and predicting game and will introduce quote unquote, the concepts of cause and effect and spatial relationships. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, seriously, if your kid does not have a basic grasp of cause and effect and how the hell are they even willing to ease The damn controller. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the game is relatively slick looking, but ultimately [pretty] worthless even for an educational game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I took eventually combined both 123 and ABC into one cart and released it in 1991 or there abouts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They released a couple more Sesame Street games, but those did not involve either Rare or Zippo. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Bad Street Brawler 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 September [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Beam Software 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Mattel 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are more games and better games that came out for the western market in September, but we can't cover them all today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we'll do just one last non-Japanese game and then cover the rest next time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Mattel makes its triumphant return to video games with "Bad Street Brawler". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This title screen is probably the coolest part of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Bad Street Brawler". And it's not really clear whether this takes place on Bad Street, or if the game is just being completely honest about its quality. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Can we have the brawlers famous epigram never Trouble Trouble Trouble as you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can practice your three moves here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He started off with a punch kick and a powerful ear pool. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Until was a major U.S. toy company and they had previously had their own game console, the Intellivision, which was [pretty] much dead and gone by the time the Nintendo Entertainment System came out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bad St. brawler Mark Mattel has returned to the world of video games and was released in conjunction with a certain infamous controller the Power Glove. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the Power Glove is rightly remembered as not being a very good controller. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the idea I guess, was [pretty] amazing when you think about it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Virtual reality and cyberspace were [pretty] hot concepts at the time, with a key piece of equipment and virtual reality being some sort of glove that you could use to To manipulate virtual objects with. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Power Glove was distributed in the U.S. by Mattel that was created by a company called Abrams gentle entertainment, run by some film and T.V. veterans. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's basically a dumbed down version of the data glove, a much more high-tech device created by Jason linear, one of the big shots in the world of virtual reality. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, he reportedly even popularized the term virtual reality. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Years later, Abrams gentle came out with a very similar glove shaped controller called dp five. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now while the Power Glove could be programmed to work, sort of, with minigames, there were [only] two games specifically designed to work with it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bad trade brawler and super glove ball also by Mattel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there were also a few games that were announced and never-released. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Footage one of these games called tech town even exist in this videotape. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...travel through time and space literally grabbing the tools you need in pursuit of the next challenge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No one has 3D moves...". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course "Bad Street Brawler" can be played with just a regular control pad as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I really don't think the Power Glove makes this game any better though. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a very simple walk left to right Beat-'em-Up with a 15 short levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You fight a few small groups of enemies, then reach a boss type fight thing, which is often just a regular enemy or two. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're usually three bosses per level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the last one is usually a new enemy type. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is a gorilla, which can be easily destroyed by using the Interpol. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right, you defeat a giant gorilla simply by pulling on sear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Between levels you throw out any of the enemy's weapons that you manage to catch, including hilariously, the gorillas bananas. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, they're just bananas. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can understand getting rid of the knives and clubs and things but why bananas. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bad tree brawler is a weirdly unbalanced game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The attacks that have changed every round. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And some attacks are way too powerful, like the quote unquote trip attack, which really looks more like you're, sort of, pushing someone on the ground and, sort of, rubbing them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the developers even And, sort of, acknowledge this because when you use the trip attack on one of these dogs, it looks like you're rubbing his tummy and you actually say nice boy, as if you were petting him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One really odd design decision was you can avoid almost all the fights except the boss fight. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In most cases, you can simply run away from the enemies until you reach the boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They'll usually, sort of, chase after you and then turn around and disappear once you reach the boss area. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Combat is [pretty] simple. It's mostly just a matter of timing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll often find a poorly timed attack passing harmlessly through the enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And enemies will often pass right through you without doing damage as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there are a few in between level rewards like this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like many Western N.E.S. games, there are some boobs tossed in, as well as some crude sexual innuendo with the reporter, sort of, symbolically giving him a handjob here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A man noticed on the title screen developer was Beam Software, the Australian company who's also involved with the U.S. version of the "Airwolf" game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is actually a portable Computer Game first released in 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Different territories was called either a "Bad Street Brawler", bop and rumble, or street hassle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Title screens all have these, sort of, slightly different versions of the artwork, but they all share in excess of nipples drawn onto the characters, in particular, the gorilla. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the DOS version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These guys with canes don't really appear until much later in the N.E.S. game of the appear on the first level of the Computer version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The moves have been changed around quite a bit as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the troop attack when used on these little Oles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh man. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also your character here it looks a lot like more like a pro wrestler or something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the ns version, his name is given as Duke Davis, and is described as a former punk rocker turned vigilante. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He bears an interesting resemblance to Duke Nukem who would, of course, get his first game in 1991. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bansri brawler is not a very well regarded game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shaun baby put on both his worst and he s games list and his work Do Games of All Time list. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while it's really not that bad, it is [pretty] awful. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's extremely linear, very repetitive, and kind of alternates between being too easy and stupidly cheap. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is basically exactly what it looks like an ugly port of a lame old Computer Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 American Dream 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 September 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by C-Dream 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Coconuts Japan 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, we're back to Japan in September 1989. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's a good one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A fantastically weird game from Coconuts Japan and the mysterious sea dream. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Look I've mentioned before have no relation to the American company Color Dreams I'm sure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "American Dream" is a [pretty] strange game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So thank goodness we have an unofficial translation from one pale dim. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, that's patchy Okun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "American Dream" is the third game from coconuts featuring the lovable anthropomorphic size Pachinko ball, patch yokan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And he's going to Brooklyn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just like the Eddie Murphy movie coming to America, but it's all gambling based. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you fly from Tokyo to New York and a helicopter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] sure that's not possible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That would certainly take a really long time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We actually have a somewhat accurate map of New York here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "American Dream" is a 'Dragon Quest' inspired game, but with gambling, and it's not really an R.P.G. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It is, sort of, takes the 'Dragon Quest' template and removes the actual R.P.G. tough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've seen a tennis R.P.G., a racing R.P.G. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So why not a gambling R.P.G.? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As we can see here, there are actually random battles on the World Map, but they really aren't important. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can make or lose a bit of money, but 99% of the action is in the casinos. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They will first need a pass to get into a casino because I guess these casinos are very exclusive and picky as to who walks in there and starts losing money. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once inside, you exchange some money for chips and start playing slots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 $1 slots for the cheapest, but you will find price your games upstairs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object of "American Dream" is simply to make money. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess it's actually to, sort of, conquer America through massive slot machine winnings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Specifically, you need to get enough money to travel to the next borough, and then you play more slots and then repeat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the first step is to make enough money and tweak and go to Queens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now why would you want to go to Queens if you're already in Brooklyn? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But remember back when this came out Brooklyn was not some hip trendy place. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who was more of, sort of, like a rough and tumble working class area where everyone spoke like stereotypical New York cab drivers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Before you leave, you'll want to find the invisible VIP card which just lying around on the ground and some random place. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you have enough cash, you wander over to this thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It looks like the Washington Square arch but it's actually the gateway to Queens and it's called the Rainbow Bridge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it is literally a rainbow bridge like the bridge to Asgard. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there is a famous Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo though it's just a regular bridge not made of Rainbows, but why they inserted it into this game is anyone's guess. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And why the hell is the toll so high? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So aside from the slot machines, various events can take place. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you enter this casino, you'll find It's haunted, or something and apps play this silly little guessing game to get out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another casino is crooked. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you injure it, they'll actually, sort of, toss you over these mountains back into Brooklyn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So after queens, you make enough money to get into the Bronx, then Manhattan and all through like a rather, sort of, lengthy circular route. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If [only] there were some sort of free public bridge connecting Manhattan in Brooklyn. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After conquering the casinos in Manhattan, logically, the final area would be Staten Island right? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Staten Island gets no love. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead, you go on to New Jersey, which kind of makes sense because in the real world, there's actual gambling there. Unlike in New York where it's illegal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, I'd say part or most of the appeal of "American Dream" is actually just how utterly ridiculous its depiction of New York is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, yeah, sure. It's [pretty] silly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you work as a bunch of open field with occasional skyscrapers and enormous casinos dotting the landscape. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of this whole, sort of, goofy take on America and American materialism. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's intriguing, but, you know, just realize that if you actually tried to play "American Dream", you'll be spending [pretty] much all your time pulling a slot machine handle over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So don't expect to get that much entertainment out of this game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Akuma no Shoutaijou 🇯🇵 // Uninvited 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 September 29 🇯🇵 // 1991 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ICOM Simulations | Kemco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are actually several games released in Japan on September 29, so we'll [only] be able to cover some of them today and then the rest next time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here though we have "a Kuma nose so tido" (or 'devils imitation') published by Kemco they will notice the name icon on the title screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this is a point-and-click Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And as many of you will have figured out, this is the game known in the U.S. as "Uninvited". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's kind of funny. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They call this Devil's invitation in Japan and put an image of an invitation on the title screen, which is, sort of, a weird bit of irony in the U.S. version because the name is "Uninvited" and they are showing an imitation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is starts a lot like icons deja vu; for begins in media "Rez". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You just crashed your car into a tree and your sister's missing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can see how the game controls in the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a large inventory menu on the right-hand side. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Below that is, sort of, a menu that allows you to, sort of, go through the pages of your inventory, among other things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the bottom menu you are have your commands. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in the lower left, there's a mini map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the upper left of course, is the window that shows you what you're looking at. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The style of "Uninvited" will be familiar to us and we've already seen deja vu and "Shadowgate". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those were the other two games in this series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And as you recall those titles were actually, sort of, pioneering point-and-click Adventure Games. Originally released on the Macintosh by icon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'd probably consider the original Computer versions to be superior to this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Mac version that invited was released in 1986. In the black and white graphics were much more high resolution than the FamiCom version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, these things were originally designed to be played with a mouse so the interface is much easier to use. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just reminder the order that we're seeing these games and is not the order they were originally created in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the Mac deja vu came first followed by "Uninvited" and finally "Shadowgate". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the Japanese FamiCom the release order was deja boo, "Shadowgate", And finally, "Uninvited". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S. we had "Shadowgate", then deja vu, And finally, "Uninvited". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This starts, sort of, like at successor game "Shadowgate". In your first challenge is simply to try to get into the house. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You probably will think to open the envelope and find a letter address to a master Crowley. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If they are not very subtle reference to Alister galley. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you also get some background information about the mystic s--- and the undead and whatever the hell's going on here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This also introduces you to the game, sort of, unlogical puzzles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The House seems to be locked up tighter than a drum. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there is no keys be found. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But when you take the pendant out of the envelope, suddenly that magically unlocks the house. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Uninvited" it feels kind of like a dry run for shadow gate. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Environments are quite similar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead of a castle you're in a haunted house. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You spend most your time opening doors and boxes and picking up things and avoiding the occasional monster. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like Shadow gate dangerous must be avoided in very specific fashions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first ghost you encounter is this one be turn on the box art. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once she appears if you interact with her or even tried to opening a door, this will result in instant death. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, in a nearby room, you'll find a bottle of no ghost. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, you can't just you know, clip us in Use it honor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, you'd have to open the bottle first, before you attempt to use it; otherwise, you'll die. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's quite a few ways to die in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And much of the charm of invited is, sort of, the gruesome death scenes that you get. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, there is nothing here as annoying as tripping and dying in the dark like it wasn't "Shadowgate". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But one really awful thing and "Uninvited" is the Ruby. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will find tons of items you can pick up, many of which do absolutely nothing, but you should pick up anyway (you know, just in case it comes out useful later). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing you will find is the Ruby and "Uninvited" gives you no hints whatsoever about not touching this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the Ruby will kill you if you hang on to it for too long. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game doesn't even tell you why you died. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It doesn't say it's because you picked up the Ruby. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, of course, everyone knows this nowadays. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But back then when the game first came out, this seemed quite cruel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 House isn't really too huge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's an upstairs and downstairs, some rooms to the side kitchen, a game room. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then there's a backyard area with three more buildings. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Solutions to the puzzles, as I mentioned, can be somewhat obscure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like throwing the box into the fireplace. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems like a bad idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you know when the box burns up, it allows you to get the apparently fireproof item that was inside the box. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now it should be pointed out there as a speak command but you don't actually talk to any anyone like you do in many of the Japanese imagery games we've seen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead of us speak to other spells, such as a thunder spell to scare away these dogs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you try to attack them or interact with them any other way they will kill you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Near the games and you'll find it underground maze which is filled with among other things, this ridiculous three animal puzzle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I do love this death scene. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object here is to get the bird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's for when you encounter this weird guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What exactly is this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Looks like something from a little feet album cover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, he runs away after the bird if you release the bird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, not the most logical thing to do. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the bottom of the maze, you'll find this frozen cave. In some dude, who I think is master Crowley. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He explains that he is put drakon that's the bad guy in some sort of suspended animation by freezing him and he needs you to throw his body down the well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A well which leads to the quote unquote dark world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This actually, this thing is [pretty] weird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, you see dragons frozen body just lying there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Trying to interact with them will cause them to wake up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead of doing this, you'd actually quit. Hold Use his body on the pit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This allows you to throw him down the pit and finishes them off and suddenly convenient nearby door will take you back into the house. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The actual reason you enter the house to begin with was to look for your sister. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you [pretty] much forgot about her until now. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game makes very few references to her after you enter the house. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's all about avoiding ghost and trying to bear what's going on with this drakon guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But then you suddenly hear a voice and eventually you'll find her this little doorless room. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure how she got in there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Did ghosts lock her up in there or something? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But she's possessed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing a little slap camp here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And your final action week you throw Holy Water at this guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally your sister doesn't even know what happened. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That silly girl. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The end! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So yeah, "Uninvited" a well done port of a, sort of, classic game that hasn't really aged that well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, but it's still reasonably fun to play if you have the patience. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that wraps up Kemco series of Mac vintra games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ochin ni Toshi Puzzle Tonjan!? 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise. 🍇

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 September 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Jaleco | NMK 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last game this episode array. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is "...Tonjan!?" (or, as it sometimes called, "Ochin ni Toshi Puzzle Tonjan!?"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Meanings something about dropping things down holes, puzzle, and pigs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Published by Jaleco. It has an M Ks name in the title screen (in MK having already been involved with a few other Jaleco cartridges such as one of the 'Ninja-kun...' games). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so we have a very cute little title screen here involving pigs, which are filthy, non-cute creatures in real life. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, don't panic; This isn't a Mahjong game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a Puzzle Game that uses Mahjong tiles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really just one of the very many "Sokoban" light games that came out around this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You push around blocks (or Mahjong tiles in this case). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those white circles are well, I don't know exactly what they are portals, maybe? holes? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You push the tiles into them and then the tiles disappear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now there's a certain order you want to push them in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 See that Thailand Third, the very top? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's the title that clears the level; you want to push that in last. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To the side we see a tile the big double points and below that there's a tile, sort of, give you like some bonus points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You want to push in the tile that doubles your points as soon as possible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the idea is simply push everything in the holes as efficiently as possible while maximizing your points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After each level, you get a rating. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As it turns out, tanjun wasn't the first pig game from nmk and Jaleco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, that was this game, simply called pig in Japan are Buddhists on or pigs and bombers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was about well pigs throwing bombs at each other. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It actually got ported do some home computer systems as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tone jam the Kwazii sequel was intended as Arcade game but was never actually released. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As far as I can tell. Jaleco or an MK ended up selling this to a Korean company called do young who released it in 1990. With altered graphics as yummier. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The overall gameplay is the same though the pig has been replaced with a new key. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So that's [pretty] much tone john and nutshell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later levels add more elements and trickier puzzles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have two ways of pushing tiles: one space at a time, or pushing them so that they all slide as far as they can. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Be careful not to mix the two buttons up and push the tiles too far. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You're actually able to die in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those fish tiles can't be pushed into the portals, otherwise, you'll lose a level and start over. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure there's any, sort of, logical in-game explanation for this. (Or for that matter why you're pushing Mahjong tiles into holes at all). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if you're a fan of semi-decent soap avant variations, I guess congratulations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's a new one for you. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 48 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, there we have it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What a horrible collection of games! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What do I even choose for the best game this episode? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe nothing? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose I could pick either ultimate quest to the avatar or "Uninvited". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, those are certainly the most well remembered games featured this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though that's almost kind of a cheat because both were ports of earlier Computer Games, and both have a lot of elements today that are kind of frustrating. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really sure really how playable they still are. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I kind of wish I could cheat and pick Final Fight or Strider from the Arcade Round-Up, but you know, that would be cheating. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So maybe "Uninvited". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least it has some sort of iconic imagery and artwork If nothing else. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the worst. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, I don't know nothing is quite outright kusoge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, "Hollywood Square's" and "Sesame Street 123" are completely worthless quickie titles pumped out with very little thought. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe I'll give the worst award to "Bad Street Brawler". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean everything about this game screams 'we don't give a s---' from the inconsistent character design, to the completely thoughtless level design, and the weirdly varying difficulty between levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the end. It's weird enough that almost becomes kind of a minor trash classic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, these three games are either British or Australian. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we can, sort of, get a good picture of the horrible video games being produced in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next up is some 'Chronturbo' and 'Chronsega'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But as for "Chrontendo ... 49", we've got another infamous game from the makers of "bad St. brawler". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we have some more Rare-develop titles, another Nintendo Adventure Game, and we have a Shooter from Konami. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we actually have a title that I'm looking forward to - a classic classic game from Capcom based on a popular T.V. show. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Things are definitely looking up for next time. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Please Visit the Chrontendo Tumblr ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Between now and then I suggest you keep it on the 'Chrontendo' Tumblr. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And yes, there is a 'Chrontendo' Tumblr, mostly just used for posting screenshots, but I'm gonna start putting up for like micro updates on Tumblr. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I, sort of, make progress on the new episodes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll keep you filled in via you know, the occasional post nothing too detailed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's more intended to let people know that you know how the episodes are progressing and to assure everyone that I'm not dead or kidnapped by terrorists or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you have not seen the 'Chrontendo' Tumblr, well, it's not hard to find. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's simply called "Chrontendo". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can look it up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright. See you later. 🍇🍌
