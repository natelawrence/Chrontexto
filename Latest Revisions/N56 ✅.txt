👓🏮🍊🎇# Oops! All Kusoge ✨



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 56 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, wow! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here we are: 🍊 February and 🍋 early March 1990. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And (hoo boy!) 🍊 this episode 🍋 is a real gem. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I was [only] familiar with 🍋 a couple of these games 🍊 but the names look 🍋 kind of interesting, 🍊 like 🍋 "Destination EarthStar". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, no, this episode 🍋 is 100% garbage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's not much of 🍋 redeeming value here, 🍊 but at least one game 🍋 is kind of fascinating 🍊 just based on 🍋 the concept alone. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ A Couple Things I Need To Point Out ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, a couple things 🍋 I need to point out: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In "...Episode 54", 🍋 I covered "Super Sprint" 🍊 (the Atari racing game) 🍊 and someone pointed out 🍋 that "Super Sprint" was 🍋 already in "...Episode 40" 🍊 (something I have absolutely 🍋 no recollection of). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, I missed 🍋 "...A Boy And His Blob...", 🍊 which was released 🍋 in January 1990, 🍊 but I had it down 🍋 as January 1991. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Wizardry" got booted 🍋 from this episode 🍊 and we'll start off by 🍋 getting caught back up with 🍊 "...A Boy And His Blob...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, sorry about that, 🍋 "Wizardry" fans 🍊 (all three of you). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so 🍋 let's get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 David Crane's a Boy and his Blob: Trouble on Blobonia 🇺🇸 // Fushigi na Blobby: Blobania no Kiki 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 January [?] 🇺🇸 // 1990 November 29 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Imagineering
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Absolute 🇺🇸 // Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, folks, 🍊 here's the weird 🍋 game this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a popular game 🍋 from a major publisher 🍊 that is unlike 🍋 almost anything else 🍊 released on the console 🍋 at that time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, I don't necessarily 🍋 mean that as a compliment. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a game that feels 🍊 both experimental and 🍋 surprisingly amateurish 🍊 (or, at the very least, 🍋 it feels rushed). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "David Crane's 🍋 A Boy And His Blob: 🍋 Trouble [on] Blobonia" 🍊 is the first of 🍋 two games this episode 🍋 with overly-long 🍋 campy titles 🍊 that are meant to evoke old 🍋 Science Fiction serials 🍋 or Pulp stories. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Against my better judgment, 🍊 I played all the way 🍋 through this game, 🍊 but luckily you can 🍋 beat this [pretty] quickly 🍊 if you know what to do. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, after the weird faux 🍋 "Raiders of the Lost Ark" 🍊 Title Screen and music, 🍋 the game starts you out 🍊 with no intro, 🍋 no cutscenes, nothing; 🍊 the game just starts. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You're a boy 🍋 and you have a blob. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Exploring the upper level, 🍋 we find a subway entrance 🍊 and (at the far right end) 🍋 a Health Food Store. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's emblematic of 🍋 "...A Boy And His Blob..." 🍊 that, of the eight screens 🍋 we've traveled through, 🍊 most [of] them are 🍋 completely empty 🍊 and serve no purpose 🍋 other than to show off 🍋 the backgrounds, 🍊 which were clearly 🍋 derived from photographs. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so we've explored 🍋 the upper levels; let's go down the stairs 🍋 to the subway 🍊 - which is also empty and 🍋 appears to be a dead end. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, how do people 🍋 get on the train, David? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here's where 🍋 the Blob comes in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 His full name is Blobert 🍋 (of course) 🍊 and he likes Jelly Beans. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I'll point out, 🍋 in this game 🍊 there is no, like, 🍋 in-game storytelling at all; 🍊 everything is explained 🍋 [only] in the manual. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Throwing Jelly Beans 🍋 at the Blob 🍊 will cause him to 🍋 change his shape. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each flavor of Jelly Bean 🍊 will change him 🍋 to something else 🍊 (an Umbrella, for example). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, neither the game 🍋 nor the manual 🍊 tell you what flavor 🍋 does what. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I would 🍋 actually recommend 🍊 writing all [of] them down 🍋 so you don't waste Jelly Beans 🍊 by feeding the Blob 🍋 the wrong flavor. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There is a sort of logic 🍋 to the bean names 🍊 (like 'Vanilla' and 'Umbrella' 🍋 both end in 'L-L-A' - 🍊 or Punch Jelly Beans 🍋 changes the Blob into a Hole - 🍋 like a Hole Punch). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The manual basically 🍋 just tells you that 🍊 you need to explore 🍋 underground Caverns 🍋 and find Treasure, 🍊 which you can then use 🍋 to purchase Vitamins 🍋 at the Vitamin store. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You will then 🍋 use these Vitamins 🍊 to defeat the 🍋 Evil Emperor of Blobonia 🍊 in the second half 🍋 of the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the part about the Vitamins 🍋 turns out to be completely untrue 🍋 (as we'll discuss later). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, the point is, 🍋 the game gives you 🍊 almost no guidance 🍋 beyond 'explore the caves' 🍊 and encourages you 🍋 to 'experiment'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, while experimentation 🍋 in video games is great, 🍊 in this case it mostly 🍋 just means trial and error. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 entering the Caverns: 🍊 clearly, you'll need to 🍋 use the Punch Jelly Bean 🍊 to get the [Blob] 🍋 to turn into a Hole. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, using the Hole on 🍋 the left side [of] the tunnel 🍊 or the far right side 🍋 [of] the tunnel 🍊 will result in you 🍋 just falling to your death. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there is a platform in 🍋 the middle section [of] the tunnel, 🍊 that you can safely put a Hole in, 🍋 land, and grab some Treasure 🍊 (as long as you don't put the Hole 🍋 above the Subway Serpent - 🍊 in which case, you will 🍋 land on him and get killed). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Using the Trampoline 🍋 is quite similar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can use it to 🍋 jump very high up, 🍊 to reach platforms that are 🍋 higher than the Ladder can go. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Often, you'll need to 🍋 jump up several screens 🍊 and then land on a platform. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, again, 🍋 trial and error - 🍊 you need to 🍋 position the Trampoline 🍋 in exactly the right spot 🍊 so you'll end up right next 🍋 to the ledge and land on it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, despite me throwing around 🍋 words like 'experimentation', 🍊 there's [pretty] much [only] one tool 🍋 that can be used to allow you to... 🍊 to go forward whenever you 🍋 reach a certain type of obstacle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For reaching higher ledges 🍋 it's the Trampoline, 🍊 for dropping down one floor 🍋 it's the Hole, 🍊 and for jumping off *high* ledges 🍋 it's the Umbrella - 🍊 which allows you to gently 🍋 float down to the ground below. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Caverns are [pretty] big; 🍋 here's a map of the whole area. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, quite a lot of it is just 🍋 empty space and it's relatively linear. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You enter on the right-hand 🍋 section of the Cavern, 🍋 go down a few floors, 🍊 at the bottom head 🍋 to the left-hand side. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You can skip the lake completely and 🍋 then just use a Ladder and Trampoline 🍊 to get back up to the top, 🍋 where you exit from a Manhole. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's nothing really 🍋 that interesting in the Caverns. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's not like "Zelda" 🍋 or "Symphony of the Night", 🍋 where ya find cool items by exploring. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, there's just Treasure - 🍋 which is, once again, completely useless. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, the issue here is: there is 🍋 really not much to do in the Caverns 🍊 (other than find your way around 🍋 without getting killed a lot). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 David Crane was, of course, 🍋 a well-known designer of Atari 2600 games 🍋 (and then later Computer games) 🍊 and, at its core, 🍋 "...A Boy And His Blob..." 🍊 is just a really big 2600 game 🍋 with better graphics. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Its obvious predecessor was 🍋 Crane's "Pitfall II" from 1984. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Much like "...A Boy And His Blob...", 🍋 "Pitfall II" had you exploring 🍋 a huge underground Cavern, 🍊 filled with deadly bats and scorpions 🍋 that you needed to avoid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Much like the Sewer Snakes in 🍋 "...A Boy And His Blob...", 🍊 you can't attack these 🍋 creatures directly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just need to make sure that they 🍋 don't touch you, as they roam around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The stated goal of "Pitfall II" 🍋 is to collect a few useless items, 🍋 stashed around the Caverns. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, the real point of the game 🍋 is just running around and exploring 🍊 (swimming through lakes, 🍋 falling down holes in the floor, 🍊 or just jumping off ledges 🍋 [to] see where you'll end up at). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you find the final item that you're 🍋 looking for, the game just ends. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No Final Boss, no Congratulations screen; 🍋 it just stops. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And "Blob"'s gameplay style 🍋 (experimentation with very little 🍋 guidance as to what to do or where to go) 🍊 actually harkens back to older games 🍋 like "Raiders of the Lost Ark" on the 2600 🍊 (an utterly baffling game that gives you 🍋 a few items like a Bullwhip and a Flute 🍊 and places you into a relatively 🍋 open world and just says, 🍋 'Okay, beat the game.'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's like a Sierra Adventure Game 🍋 with no text. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As kids, we had no idea 🍋 what to do with this thing 🍊 (other than just 🍋 wandering around aimlessly) 🍊 until, one day, an older kid 🍋 showed us the very specific steps 🍋 you had to take to beat it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Looking at "...A Boy And His Blob..." 🍋 from this perspective 🍊 might give some context to the 🍋 game's lack of hints or guidance 🍊 or the surprisingly 🍋 anti-climatic Boss fight. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game was [pretty] successful, 🍋 I believe, 🍊 and received a, uh, little-known sequel 🍋 for the Game Boy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A modern-day remake (or reimagining) 🍋 of "...A Boy And His Blob..." 🍋 was released for the Wii. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This version is much more normal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The characters are cuter, 🍊 it gives you more direction 🍋 and clues about what to do, 🍊 it's designed to be 🍋 a lot more intuitive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You pick up new types of Jelly Beans, 🍋 as you progress through the game 🍊 (rather than starting with all [of] them, 🍋 like you do in the N.E.S. game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It tells you what the Jelly Beans do 🍋 when you select them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think most people would probably 🍋 enjoy this a bit more than the original, 🍋 but it is a very different game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'This way!'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so I mentioned earlier that 🍋 the [only] thing to do in the Caverns 🍋 is to collect Treasure. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The number at the top of the screen tells you 🍋 how many pieces of Treasure you have left. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I said earlier, 🍋 the Treasure is absolutely useless 🍊 but there is one thing in the Caverns 🍋 that you *must* get. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This bag contains a bunch of Jelly Beans 🍋 (very helpful, if you're running low on 🍋 certain flavors, 🍊 but it also gives you a new flavor, Lime, 🍋 which is needed to finish the game later on). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here if you give Blobert 🍋 an Apple Jelly Bean, 🍊 he'll turn into a Jack 🍋 and pop open the Manhole - 🍊 and you can now 🍋 exit the Cavern. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then I suppose you would 🍋 go to the Health Food Store, 🍊 trade in the Treasure for Vitamins 🍋 (very expensive Vitamins, apparently). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so now what? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, we use a Root Beer Jelly Bean 🍋 and Blobert turns into a Rocket 🍋 and flies to Blobonia. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And we now begin the 🍋 second section of the game, 🍊 which is much shorter 🍋 and completely linear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so all ya do here is 🍋 you walk from left to right 🍊 through several screens 🍋 until ya find these guys. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, hypothetically you would use 🍋 your Vitamin Gun to shoot these dudes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Remember, all the Treasure you collected 🍋 was spent buying those Vitamins. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They're sort of like bullets in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, instead [of] the Gun, you can just 🍋 use the Coconut. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All the Coconut does is roll. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, once you exit a screen 🍋 via the right-hand side, 🍊 if you turn around and re-enter 🍋 that previous screen 🍊 all of the enemies 🍋 are now gone permanently. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you just roll the Coconut 🍋 past the enemies, 🍊 then call the Blob back to you, 🍋 and he'll clear all the screams 🍋 of all the enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, honestly, I can't tell if this was 🍋 intended or if it's just some kind of bug. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, if this wasn't something 🍋 that was put in on purpose, 🍋 then... what the hell is the Coconut for? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, finally, you enter 🍋 the Evil Emperor's lair 🍊 (which is, like, 🍋 a red brick schoolhouse building?). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This doesn't even really look 🍋 like an alien planet to me. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya need to trampoline up this machine 🍋 and turn it off, 🍊 so it stops the marshmallows (or whatever) 🍋 from falling on you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you get the [only] really 🍋 difficult enemy in the game: 🍊 these teeth that move randomly - 🍋 and you have to run through them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then you have to do this again 🍋 a few screens later. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like all the enemies in this game, 🍋 you don't fight them, 🍊 you don't engage them in battle or anything; 🍋 you just need to get past them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The design philosophy here is 🍋 'enemies as obstacles'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so basically we're done here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... This is where ya use the Lime Jelly Bean. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It turns the Blob into a Key 🍋 so you can unlock this door. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you don't have the Lime Jelly Beans, 🍋 then I suppose you can 🍋 fly back to Earth and get it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for the Boss: 🍋 (and you're probably not gonna like this) 🍊 it's not a Boss battle 🍋 in any normal sense. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, the Emperor doesn't even move; 🍋 he's just part of the... the background. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya need to knock over 🍋 that jar of Vitamins above his head. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is done by feeding the Blob 🍋 an Apple Jelly Bean. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, that large rock 🍋 is in your way, so you must run, 🍊 in order to throw the Jelly Bean 🍋 further than normal. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, there is a delay 🍋 between hitting the throw button 🍊 and when the Jelly Bean 🍋 actually leaves your hand. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, it'll take a few tries 🍋 to get the timing just right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once this happens, you've won. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And don't expect any cutscenes 🍋 or anything fancy like that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "...A Boy And His Blob..." is a weird game and 🍋 it's [only] gotten weirder since its release. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Its gameplay style 🍋 would have felt somewhat familiar 🍊 to someone who'd grown up playing 🍋 the Atari 2600 or early Computer games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, if you pick it up now 🍋 (for the first time) 🍊 its aimlessness, 🍋 its lack of any in-game clues, 🍊 the fact that it's split into two 🍋 almost completely unrelated parts - 🍋 all this makes it feel 'off', somehow. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The intervening 30 years 🍋 of video game development 🍋 has led us to expect certain things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And "...A Boy And His Blob..." 🍋 simply has no interest in 🍋 giving us any of those things. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kiteretsu Daihyakka 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 February 23 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Epoch | Fill-In-Café
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Epoch 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so (picking up February 23rd) 🍋 we have "Kiteretsu Daihyakka" from Epoch 🍊 (the same guys who made that Pinball 🍋 Baseball Game, a couple episodes ago). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll recall that Epoch had 🍋 produced several consoles themselves 🍋 (like the Cassette Vision) 🍊 before finally giving up 🍋 and making games for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, when I first saw the box art 🍋 for this game I immediately thought, 🍊🍓 'Wait a sec; 🍋 I know I've covered a game 🍋 based on this Anime. 🍇 🍊🍓 This looks so familiar. 🍇 🍊🍓 Was it that Mega Drive game 🍋 that came out, right after 🍋 the console launched?'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, it turned out that - 🍋 no, this is the first game 🍋 based on the 'Kiteretsu' property. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It began as a Manga in the 1970s 🍋 and later an animated TV series ran 🍋 for several years in the '80s and '90s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The characters were actually 🍋 created by Fujiko Fujio 🍋 (the same team that produced Doraemon). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Someone described 'Kiteretsu' to me as being 🍋 'Doraemon with the serial numbers filed off'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some online sources claim that an English 🍋 version of the cartoon was released 🍋 as "Kevin and B.U.D.S.T.E.R.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, I couldn't find any evidence 🍋 of this actually existing, 🍊 so it's probably just 🍋 an Internet urban legend. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can see, this is a [pretty] unappealing-🍋 looking side-scrolling Platformer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was never released in the U.S. but 🍋 luckily for all you masochists out there, 🍊 there is an unofficial English translation 🍋 which allows us to enjoy the game's story. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, Kiteretsu (the main character) 🍋 is some sort of super-smart inventor kid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He has a little robot buddy 🍋 (who is definitely *not* Doraemon) 🍊 and some friends 🍋 that include a girl [and] a fat kid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He invents a machine that allows one to 🍋 travel to 'the world of dreams' 🍊 and his dumbass friends activate it, 🍊 so now Kiteretsu has to go to 🍋 the dream world and rescue them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this game is very "Mario"-esque 🍋 and even has an underwater level 🍊 that is ripped straight out of 🍋 "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, it does include a 🍋 rather interesting mechanic, 🍊 where you can reverse gravity 🍋 and walk on the ceiling. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This idea would be used in another 🍋 (much better) game, 🍊 which we'll encounter later in 1990. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, one thing ya have to do here 🍋 is collect Gold. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This will be used for creating inventions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You do this by pressing the A Button 🍋 *really* fast to fill up the bar. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The whole button-pressing thing 🍋 seems [pretty] unnecessary to me, 🍊 but you will need these inventions 🍋 to make progress, in most cases. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like here, for example; 🍋 ya need to build this Shrink-Ray to 🍋 get your girlfriend out [of] the house. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After she's back to normal size, 🍋 she will join you on your quest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is mostly linear, but there are 🍋 some areas that're sort of hidden - 🍊 like this total knockoff of the 🍋 "Super Mario Bros." underwater levels 🍊 (except the underwater physics 🍋 are very different 🍊 and it's purty hard to control 🍋 your characters, while you're swimming). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one very *clever* thing that I 🍋 actually *did* like was that 🍊 when you run out of lives 🍋 you are sent to Hell 🍋 and can borrow extra lives. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can, of course, 🍋 [only] do this so many times 🍋 before ya get a Game Over, 🍊 but it's a clever way of employing 🍋 the concept of 'lives' in a video game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, don't get me wrong; 🍋 despite having some cute ideas, 🍋 this is not a good game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably the worst thing about it 🍋 is trying to control 🍋 multiple characters at once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When they move, they're not quite in sync - 🍋 and this makes jumping incredibly troublesome. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's very common to jump 🍋 and have one character land safely 🍋 and have the other fall to their death. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Make no mistake; 🍋 I absolutely *hated* this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's also [pretty] hard on the eyes - 🍋 with ugly textures and busy backgrounds. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The whole game just feels 🍋 like a lot of random bullshit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Fill-In-Cafe was involved 🍋 in this to some extent 🍋 (they appear to have done the sound?). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Later, two more 🍋 'Kiteretsu' games were released 🍊 (for the Game Boy and the Super FamiCom), 🍊 and then the cartoon series ended in 1996 🍊 and the world has *fortunately* 🍋 been 'Kiteretsu'-free since then. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Don't worry, though; 🍋 for all you licensed-game lovers, 🍊 we have another Anime game coming up 🍋 later this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dead Fox Ningen Keiki 🇯🇵 // Code Name: Viper 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 February 23 🇯🇵 // 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom | Arc System Works
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, boy! here we go! 🍋 "Ningen Keiki: Dead Fox" from Capcom 🍊 (which literally translates to 🍋 'Human Weapon: Dead Fox'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, just so you know, 🍋 this is not exactly top-tier Capcom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's middle-tier at best, 🍋 and I suspect you'll hate this game 🍋 if you ever try playing through it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, of course, this was released 🍋 outside of Japan as "Code Name: Viper". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess 'Viper' sounds more 🍋 badass in English than 'Dead Fox'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing that is rather odd is the 🍋 copyright on the U.S. version saying '1989', 🍊 while the Japanese version says '1990', 🍊 despite "Code Name: Viper" 🍋 being released in March 🍋 (one year after the Japanese release). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Possibly this was created 🍋 for the U.S. market in 1989 🍊 but the release got delayed 🍋 until 1990, for some reason. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This opening cutscene 🍋 raises a number of questions - 🍊 most notably, 🍋 'Is he wearing pants?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 His legs are flesh-colored, 🍋 so it's not hard to interpret this 🍊 as meaning he's wearing a jacket, 🍋 and boots, and... nothing else. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, what is that little blob of pixels 🍋 near his waist supposed to be (a gun?)? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He fires from his other hand. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, why would he be pointing his 🍋 gun barrel at his superior officer, 🍋 while being briefed? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One interesting thing: 🍋 Commander Jones seems to have 🍋 pioneered the use of standing desks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, just look at how tall 🍋 those desks are, in the background. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so we've got to destroy 🍋 seven drug cartel bases. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is done by: 🍋 a. shooting everyone we see, 🍋 b. freeing any captives you find, and 🍊 c. getting grenades from 🍋 a captured fellow soldier. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why doesn't the Army 🍋 just give you grenades? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, they gave you a gun; 🍊 I'm sure that the Army 🍋 could spare a few grenades. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the main novelty 🍋 in "Code Name: Viper" 🍋 is the spinning doors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When you stand in front of them, 🍋 the door will revolve - 🍊 sometimes revealing a captive or ammo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Many times there's nothing 🍋 in the door at all, 🍊 but the doors come in useful 🍋 because they can also 🍊 be used to temporarily hide 🍋 from enemy projectiles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies seem to walk around 🍋 somewhat randomly, so they will 🍊 often just walk away while you're 🍋 using the revolving doors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One (and [only] one) door 🍋 contains the grenades, 🍊 so you must find that door, 🍋 in order to exit the level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you reach the end [of] the level, 🍋 you will automatically throw 🍋 the grenade that you have. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Unless you don't have the grenades, 🍋 of course; 🍊 then you'll need to turn back 🍋 and keep looking for them). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Between levels, you have, like, 🍋 a little campfire cookout with this guy, 🍊 who appears to be decoding a 🍋 letter from the drug cartel? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You know these guys are badass because 🍋 they sign their letters with, like, 🍊 little drawings of 🍋 a skull with an eye patch. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then it's on to the next level 🍋 and, quite frankly, 🍊 all the levels here 🍋 are [pretty] much the same. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, they all have different themes - 🍊 like, there's a jungle level, 🍋 a military camp level, 🍋 a high-tech research lab level... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each has slightly different hazards, 🍋 but they all feel very similar, 🍋 with a few minor exceptions. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Code Name: Viper" doesn't have 🍋 the variety of something like 🍋 "Strider" or "Mega Man". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It feels [pretty] samey, 🍋 throughout the entire game, 🍋 and it's actually a bit repetitive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, 🍋 sometimes you're jumping onto cliffs, 🍊 sometimes it's metal crates, and 🍋 sometimes it's on ancient ruins - 🍊 but every level s... 🍋 feels very similar. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one unusual thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The guy with the bombs is p... placed in 🍋 an apparently randomized location 🍋 that changes every time ya play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you really do need to check 🍋 every door until ya find the grenades. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And I guess the question arises, 🍋 'Why didn't the drug cartel guys 🍋 search him and find the grenades?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 According to the intro, 🍋 the, uh, commando was injured and captured 🍋 and that's who you're looking for. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, are we to understand 🍋 this somehow happens seven times 🍋 (once in each base)? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Seven different grenade-carrying 🍋 commandos got captured? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's actually [pretty] lucky for you 🍋 because without those commandos' grenades 🍋 you'd never be able to finish the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as you may know, "Code Name: Viper" 🍋 is [pretty] derivative of "Rolling Thunder", 🍊 a Namco Arcade game from 1986, 🍋 which also involved opening a lot [of] doors 🍊 - but which also had weirder-looking enemies 🍋 and was [pretty] damn annoying. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This got a port to the FamiCom 🍋 in March 1989 🍊 and this port was actually 🍋 changed in a lot of ways. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I covered it in "Chrontendo ... 43" 🍋 and I barely remember it, 🍊 other than the weird cutscenes 🍋 where the bad guys did, like, 🍋 Industrial Dance moves, 🍊 while watching their girlfriend get 🍋 raped, I guess, on their big-screen TV. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, so things that 🍋 I don't like about this game, 🍊 aside from its extreme 🍋 simplicity and repetitiveness: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's very hard often in a non-fun way; 🍊 I mean, "Mega Man" was 🍋 hard in creative ways. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Code Name: Viper" is hard 🍊 because enemies continuously 🍋 appear on the edge of the screen 🍋 and instantaneously fire at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies move around and fire in 🍋 what feels like random patterns. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I found myself kind of inching forward, 🍋 when moving through the levels, 🍊 so I wouldn't be shot 🍋 in the face by surprise. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like in "Mottomo Abunai Deka", 🍋 you have to constantly crouch 🍋 to avoid enemy bullets 🍊 (which is something that I 🍋 personally don't really like, in games). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the platforming is awful. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I had to try this section multiple times 🍋 because in mid-jump the damaging slime 🍋 might fall down and hit you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's hard to explain, 🍋 if you haven't played it, 🍊 but the jumping is actually 🍋 [pretty] terrible in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're too close to the edge 🍋 of the platform when jumping 🍊 you'll just sort of fall off the platform 🍋 instead of jumping correctly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to jump while you're, sort of, 🍋 in the center of the platform. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there is some cool stuff 🍋 in the last couple levels 🍊 (like these elevators that 🍋 move you from floor to floor). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But none of this makes up 🍋 for the game's monotony. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no Boss fights, 🍋 or interesting items, 🍋 or any in-game dialogue 🍊 - except for the cutscenes 🍋 at the beginning and the end. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, the guy with the campfire 🍋 who always just says this one line 🍋 over and over again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By the second-to-last level, 🍋 the guy has deciphered 🍋 almost the entire letter. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The plan is to supply drugs to [blank] 🍋 who can be found at his home in [blank]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hmm! Who could this mysterious figure be? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, there's literally [only] 🍋 one other character in the game 🍊 (aside from you and the campfire guy) 🍋 so it's not very hard to figure this out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The last cartel base is 🍋 probably the most interesting; 🍊 it has various spiky floors 🍋 and conveyor belts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's not really good, 🍋 but at least it throws in a bit of variety. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so the guy in charge of 🍋 the drug cartel is... Commander Jones! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Wow! 🍋 I definitely did not see that one coming. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you head to his mansion, 🍊 and then suddenly you're 🍋 in a "Castlevania" game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you have to 🍋 avoid lightning strikes? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Does Commander Jones 🍋 control the weather? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've climbed up Jones's tower, 🍋 you face off with him 🍊 for the shortest Boss fight of all time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We just start shooting at each other 🍋 and whoever dies first loses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's helpful to duck 🍋 and to have the rifle 🍋 (which... I didn't have). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We've both died at the same time 🍋 (which apparently counts as a Win). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For me, this seems like 🍋 a very low-grade Capcom game 🍊 and one of the least-interesting 🍋 Capcom games for the N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Code Name: Viper" feels like something 🍋 that was intended for the Arcades 🍋 but ended up on the console instead. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It has a very Arcadey feel to it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, some people like this 🍋 but I'm saying "Code Name: Viper" 🍊 should be thrown into 🍋 the dustbin of history. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Akuma-kun: Makai no Wana 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 February 24 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I promised you another Anime game 🍋 and here it is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Please note: the animated intro shown here 🍋 is probably the coolest part [of] the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Akuma-kun: Makai no Wana" 🍋 is a rather bizarre J.R.P.G. 🍊 from the powerhouse team 🍋 of Bandai and Tose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's basically about 🍋 a kid who can summon demons 🍋 and uses them to fight other demons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If that reminds you a little bit 🍋 of 'Megami Tensei', 🍊 well you're not wrong, 🍋 but this is a much different game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] stripped-down 🍋 R.P.G., of sorts, 🍊 and doesn't seem to have 🍋 entered the pantheon of classic 🍋 FamiCom Role-Playing Games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your character, here, 🍋 is the titular Akuma-kun 🍊 (a kid who, for some reason, was 🍋 born with demon-summoning powers). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As the Wikipedia entry wryly states, 🍊 "Akuma-kun wants to create a world 🍋 where all human beings can live happily, 🍊 and he believes that 🍋 harnessing the power of demons 🍊 is necessary for him 🍋 to achieve [this] goal.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know, kid; 🍋 that sounds like a bad idea to me. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this, of course, was based on... 🍋 that's right a Manga and Anime. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Several different Akuma comics series 🍋 were published in the '60s and '70s, 🍊 but this game is specifically based on 🍋 the Toei animated series 🍋 from the late-'80s/early-'90s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Akuma-kun''s creator, Shigeru Mizuki, 🍋 is mostly known for 'GeGeGe no Kitarou' - 🍊 another supernatural-themed comic, 🍋 which Bandai and Tose also 🍋 made into a video game in 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You might remember it as "Ninja Kid", 🍋 as it was re-titled 🍋 for the U.S. version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, while a lot of FamiCom R.P.G.s 🍋 have been fan-translated, 🍊 "Akuma-kun" [only] has a 🍋 *very* partial translation 🍋 (mostly menus and some dialogue). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned earlier, 🍋 this is [pretty] strange, as J.R.P.G.s go, 🍊 and I apologize for all the ugly 🍋 untranslated text in here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You start in Hell Village 🍊 (this place looks [pretty] dead 🍋 if you ask me). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's the house of Dr. Faust 🍋 who will save your game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's a Magic Store, 🍋 where you can't buy any, like, 🍋 decent spells as of yet - 🍊 but later you'll need to 🍋 purchase some stuff here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can also travel to... 🍋 (I guess this is) Tokyo 🍊 where you live with your parents. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In Tokyo you can rest [at] your house 🍋 so, it acts as, like, a free Inn, 🍊 but there's really 🍋 nothing else to do in Tokyo. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike most J.R.P.G.s where ya have, 🍋 like, a top-down view of each town, 🍊 here we can [only] walk 🍋 horizontally left or right 🍊 and there's not really any interactions 🍋 of note with the townspeople. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Exiting to the overworld 🍋 doesn't really do much either. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You are [pretty] much trapped on the island 🍋 of Japan for the beginning [of] the game 🍊 and, apparently, there are no other 🍋 cities of note in Japan beyond Tokyo. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, before you can leave Japan, 🍋 you need to defeat Cerberus 🍊 who is waiting for you in 🍋 one of the rooms in Hell Town. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, he's way too 🍋 powerful for you, 🍊 so you need to go next door 🍋 to this Training Room, 🍊 where you just fight 🍋 random groups of monsters 🍊 over and over again, 🍋 in order to level up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And I almost (but not really) 🍋 appreciate the way this game strips all 🍋 the pretenses from the J.R.P.G. formula. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no exploring or adventure here 🍋 as a... mechanism that explains 🍋 why you're fighting monsters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just enter an empty room, 🍋 fight a battle, exit the room, 🍋 and then re-enter 🍊 and repeat this over and over again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your battles are performed 🍋 in the usual fashion. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You, yourself, have little 🍋 offensive power at the moment 🍊 - but you do have 🍋 8 minions you can summon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you summon, 🍋 they will fight on your behalf 🍊 until they lose their Hit Points 🍋 or the battle is over. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The default setting is that they 🍋 will fight automatically each turn, 🍊 but you can control them 🍋 manually if you want 🍊 (though this makes 🍋 each battle even longer). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, let me tell ya, 🍋 the battles are long and monotonous 🍊 - compared to something like 🍋 "Dragon Quest" or "Final Fantasy". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At Level 1, your minions will 🍋 typically do about one point 🍋 of damage when they attack, 🍊 which means that every battle 🍋 is gonna last a few rounds. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In addition to this, 🍋 for every battle, 🍊 you need to manually select 🍋 which minions you want to summon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then each minion appears, 🍋 one by one, on the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a summoning animation, 🍋 uh, that thankfully can be skipped, 🍊 but regardless battles are slow, 🍋 compared to most other J.R.P.G.s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, yes, and most of the enemies 🍋 you fight, at this point, 🍊 will give you one 🍋 Experience Point. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've leveled up a few times 🍊 and gotten enough money 🍋 to purchase some magic, 🍊 you will be able to fight Cerberus. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A walkthrough I found recommended 🍋 to get to Level 4 to do this 🍊 (which requires 100 Experience Points 🍋 - and remember most battles give you 🍋 between 1 and 3 Experience Points). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I was able to beat him 🍋 at, uh, Level 3, thankfully. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, and please note that 🍋 (unlike some J.R.P.G.s) 🍋 here, Cerberus has all three of his heads. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, once he's defeated, 🍋 Dr. Faust opens up a cave, 🍊 which will allow you to travel 🍋 under the ocean to the mainland. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At this point, "Akuma-kun" becomes 🍋 more like a normal J.R.P.G.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya wander around, fight random battles 🍋 (which are apparently infrequent, 🍋 based on the time that I played this), 🍊 and [there] will also be a few towns with shops 🍋 - but not really many people to talk to. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's apparently not really a 🍋 whole lot of content in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's [only] around four Bosses, 🍋 I believe, and it's relatively short. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's able to be beaten in 🍋 just, like, several hours 🍊 - though the Final Boss 🍋 looks like an enormous slog. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the video playthrough I found, 🍋 the Boss fight took about a half-hour. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, I suppose this falls somewhere 🍋 between, like, a standard J.R.P.G. 🍋 (like "Dragon Quest") 🍊 and old-school Computer R.P.G.s 🍋 (like "Wizardry") - 🍊 with its emphasis on combat and 🍋 de-emphasis on things like exploring 🍋 towns and talking to N.P.C.s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's an odd game 🍋 (and not a good game, 🍋 as far as I can tell). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure there are far worse 🍋 R.P.G.s on the FamiCom, 🍊 but this feels 🍋 far too boring to actually play 🍊 and its lack of a full translation 🍋 is probably no loss. 🍇



"🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dragon Unit 🇯🇵 // Castle of Dragon 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 February 27 🇯🇵 // 1990 June [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Athena
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Athena 🇯🇵 // Seta 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so we jump 🍋 from Tose to Athena - 🍊 the minds behind such classics 🍋 as "Family Quiz" and "Lutter" 🍊 (two games we covered earlier, 🍋 but I'm sure you don't remember; 🍋 I certainly don't). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing I can tell ya: 🍋 the intro is cool. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, a dragon kidnapped a lady 🍋 (as dragons often do) 🍋 and ya have to rescue her. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, so far, so good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This looks kind of like "Castlevania". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Trust me, though; 🍋 you will be disappointed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Dragon Unit" was apparently considered 🍋 to be slick enough to get a U.S. release 🍋 by Seta, under the name "Castle of Dragon" 🍊 (which is just [as] bad 🍋 a name as "Dragon Unit"). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The backstory is told in the manual. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your name is Geraden and 🍋 apparently, the evil dragon, Darklarza, 🍊 has kidnapped this princess 🍋 that you were supposed to marry. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, technically she was kidnapped 🍋 by Darklarza's son, Dragon Cub. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the princess's father 🍋 is named King Boros. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He doesn't turn up in the game itself 🍋 but gets several mentions in the manual 🍊 and was considered important enough 🍋 to actually have a drawing 🍋 of him in there as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, let me tell ya, 🍋 the art in the "Castle of Dragon" manual 🍋 is definitely a trip. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, this game is like "Castlevania", 🍋 except that... it's awful? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, there really aren't 🍋 a whole lot of enemies, here, 🍊 but the game loves to toss in lots of 🍋 (what feel like) mini-Bosses at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like this guy, who is just obnoxious: 🍋 whenever ya hit him, he disappears 🍋 and then reappears from off-screen 🍊 (which feels like a bug, 🍋 but I think, probably, it wasn't). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot [of] the fights involve a 🍋 single enemy, who comes rushing at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya try to hit him a couple times, 🍋 and then back up or jump over him, 🍋 and then just keep repeating. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then you also get a few 🍋 mostly harmless enemies (like bats) 🍋 flying across the screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The meter on your left is your Health Bar 🍋 and the one on your right is your XP. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When it fills up, 🍋 your Life Bar gets longer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, Fairies'll fly across the screen 🍋 and, if you jump to touch them, 🍋 your Health [will] be refilled. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Dragon Unit" is hypothetically a port 🍋 of a 1989 Arcade game of the same name. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Arcade game was much more 🍋 a... of a frantic Beat-'em-Up 🍊 with multiple enemy types 🍋 on-screen at once 🍊 and constant weapon and armor drops, 🍋 as well as screaming Metal music. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies move horizontally in either 🍋 a foreground lane or a background lane. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You, yourself, can move 🍋 from lane to lane freely. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also some awkward 🍋 platforming sequences. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't think "Dragon Unit" made 🍋 a very big splash at the arcades. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the N.E.S. port [only] 🍋 resembles the Arcade game 🍋 in the most superficial ways. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose maybe they thought 🍋 the name and concept would 🍋 translate well into a home game? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Overall, the game is 🍋 weird and inconsistent. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, the first enemy in Heresy Forest 🍋 is this weird little thing 🍊 that rushes at you super quick 🍋 and starts draining your Health 🍊 and [will] knock off several Life Bars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just a really strange 🍋 way to start a [new] level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then you get a whole bunch of really 🍋 weak monsters and some awful platforming. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first two levels are really short 🍊 and the remaining section 🍋 (Darklarza's Castle) is much longer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At some point, you'll get a Mace - 🍋 which is a huge game-changer, 🍋 since it knocks enemies back a bit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, most enemies can't just 🍋 bum rush you and start draining 🍋 your health by touching you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, you still can be knocked around 🍋 by certain types of enemies 🍋 (even if you hit them with a Mace). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Castle of Dragon" seems like a 🍋 [pretty] unfair game in a lot [of] ways. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you might ask, 🍋 'How many lives do ya have?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, here's the kicker: 🍋 you have one life. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, you die one time, 🍋 and it's Game Over. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Considering how easy it is to get 🍋 knocked off a pillar or something 🍊 and fall to your death, this 🍋 is a [pretty] bizarre decision. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There're three Boss battles in this 🍋 game and they're all very similar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The chicken-headed thing is 🍋 supposed to be Quetzalcoatl. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They all move in a very similar pattern 🍊 and ya need to position yourself so 🍋 that the shield blocks their fireballs, 🍊 and then move underneath the Boss 🍋 to avoid them stomping on you, 🍊 and then attacking them by jumping 🍋 and hitting them on the head. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, and did I mention that there're 🍋 these random bursts of thunder and 🍋 lightning that occur every few seconds 🍊 (which gets very tiresome)? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Castle of Dragon" is 🍋 a [pretty] confusing game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the art is [pretty] good, 🍋 the music is okay in places; 🍊 it just makes so many 🍋 [inscrutable] decisions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For every cool thing in the game, 🍋 it has, like, 9 random awful things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's almost impossible to imagine 🍋 playing through this without save states. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game itself doesn't give you 🍋 any information as to what's going on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There're no cutscenes or dialogue or 🍋 any explanation of what's happening. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this probably adds to the 🍋 overall feeling that it's just a 🍋 bunch of random crap going on here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, what you actually need to do 🍋 is collect several items 🍊 from the various floors [of] the castle 🍋 before you can face Darklarza. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The final level has this 🍋 [pretty] cool mirror effect 🍊 (which, of course, leads to you 🍋 facing your exact double). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Final Boss 🍊 (who is just a bigger more annoying 🍋 version of the first two Bosses) 🍊 has a sneaky catch. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can [only] use the Sword to attack him 🍋 and you will die if you lose your Armor. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You have sort of 🍋 a double Life Bar, in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If the Life Bar is depleted once, 🍋 you will lose your Armor - and 🍊 if it's depleted a second time, 🍋 you'll actually die. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Except in this Boss battle, 🍋 in which you instantly die if you 🍋 lose your Armor, for some reason.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At the end, you walk down the hall 🍋 and ya meet your friend, the princess. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, this game has 🍋 one last little twist. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Before she actually appears, 🍋 you can enter in a secret code. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Basically, this involves holding down 🍋 most [of] the buttons on the controller 🍋 and the princess will then appear topless. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hubba hubba! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Castle of Dragon" is not a fun game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [pretty] damn frustrating 🍋 and just feels thrown together 🍋 with no rhyme or reason. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 February [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Beam
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, boy! 🍋 Here we go again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One of the two non-Japanese 🍋 releases in February: 🍊 "Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum" 🍋 is published by Data East, but 🍋 developed by... Beam Software. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Granted, this game is not 🍋 "Back To The Future"; 🍋 it's not that irritating. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, I can say that, 🍋 after watching this video, 🍊 you probably aren't gonna gr... 🍋 run out and grab a copy of this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, in the cutscene, Dash rolls up 🍋 in his 1956 Buick (or whatever), 🍊 there's this giant rocket, and 🍋 the screen flashed a few times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose the game takes place 🍋 inside the rocket. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The manual is [pretty] unclear 🍋 about what's happening. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It says you've just landed a 🍋 thousand light-years from home 🍋 on an alien planet 🍊 filled with strange creatures, 🍋 deadly force fields, 🍋 and dangerous pitfalls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And your goal is to make your way 🍋 through this incredible maze 🍊 of rocket rooms and elevator shafts 🍋 and return safely to your ship. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, maybe this is an alien ship we're in? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though sometimes you enter a room 🍋 and you'll be suddenly outside? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 To make matters more confusing, 🍋 the back [of] the box says 🍊 you've landed in the mental ward 🍋 of the galaxy, The Alien Asylum, 🍊 and that you need to destroy 🍋 'Overlords' in the 'Control Complex'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, there's really not a whole 🍋 lot of thought or consistency 🍊 when it comes to the 🍋 story of this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, regardless of whatever 🍋 this game is apparently about, 🍊 "Dash Galaxy" is sort of 🍋 a mixture of a, uh, "Sokoban"-style 🍋 block-pushing Puzzle Game 🍊 and an "Impossible Mission"-style 🍋 Action Platformer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, there's a few things 🍋 you can pick up in this game 🍋 (Bombs and other helpful items) 🍊 and if you look at the bottom of your 🍋 screen, it will show your inventory. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can carry Keys, Bombs, 🍋 Detonators, and Stars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Hearts just show you 🍋 how many lives you have left 🍊 and the Stars'll give you 🍋 temporary invincibility, 🍊 once you collect 🍋 (I think) 10 of them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, ya start off on Floor 0-0. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are 25 floors, total, 🍊 and about 100 rooms 🍋 in the entire game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 When you enter a room, 🍋 the door is locked, 🍊 and you then have to press 🍋 several switches in the room 🍊 to open the door again 🍋 so you can leave. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, ya might ask, 🍋 'If you're just gonna leave, what's 🍋 the point of entering the room?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, for 90% of the rooms, 🍋 the answer is: 🍊 'Absolutely nothing; 🍋 you can just skip them'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One could almost say, 🍋 'The [only] way to win 🍋 this game is not to play.'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the actual goal, here, 🍋 is to get to the top floor 🍊 and you can just walk right 🍋 into the elevator shaft 🍊 and go to the next floor, 🍋 in most cases. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On some floors, there might be 🍋 something blocking the elevator shaft, 🍊 so you'll need to use 🍋 a Bomb or a Key. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, in the upper levels, 🍋 you're required to find 🍋 a few hidden doors 🍊 in order to proceed 🍋 on to the next level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A few things about this remind me 🍋 of "...A Boy And His Blob...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, one is that you can 🍋 just skip whole sections of the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The other is, you don't really 🍋 engage enemies much. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Dash doesn't have laser guns 🍋 or weapons (other than bombs) 🍊 and enemies don't 🍋 actually attack you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They typically just walk 🍋 or fly back and forth across the screen 🍊 and ya might need 🍋 to jump over them 🍊 or wait for them to pass, 🍋 before moving forward. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, both games seem very invested 🍋 in trying to give the game protagonist 🍋 some sort of feeling of realistic physics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, for example, the boy had that 🍋 thing where he would do a little skid 🍋 across the ground when he stopped running. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And that annoying little wind-up 🍋 when he threw a Jelly Bean. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Dash Galaxy" feels... sort of 🍋 influenced by "Prince of Persia". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a lot of little subtle 🍋 changes to his sprite, as he moves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, when you hold down the, uh,... the 🍋 D-Pad while running for a couple seconds, 🍋 Dash will change from a walk to a run. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And he doesn't just speed up; 🍋 his whole posture changes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When doing a running jump, he 🍋 stretches his arms out in front of him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And when landing 🍋 after a high jump or fall 🍊 he bends his knees 🍋 to soften the impact. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Compare this to, say, Batman's sprite 🍋 from a couple episodes ago. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, his cape flaps in the wind, 🍋 but his torso remains completely still 🍋 as he ducks and jumps. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This interest in physics might explain 🍋 why the game is basically centered 🍋 around trampolines and jumping. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One does not normally associate 🍋 Science Fiction with trampolines 🍊 and the fact that you spend 🍋 so much time jumping on trampolines 🍊 makes one suspect that maybe 🍋 this was originally planned to be 🍋 a completely different game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The actual physics, here, 🍋 are [pretty] strange 🍊 and'll take some 🍋 getting used to. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, to jump higher you would 🍋 assume you would do a running jump. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (That's, like, a video game law, right?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, here a running jump makes 🍋 you do, like, a low flying leap forward. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 To jump high, you have to 🍋 walk slowly or stand still, 🍊 jump straight up, 🍋 and then push the 🍋 D-Pad while in mid-air. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are some very odd things. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Instead of Health, you have Oxygen 🍊 (which slowly runs out but also gets 🍋 depleted when an enemy touches you). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess this makes sense but... 🍋 you refill your Oxygen by 🍋 picking up Erlenmeyer Flasks(?)... 🍊 (which obviously can 🍋 hold liquid, but not gas). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, why didn't they draw the sprites 🍋 as Oxygen tanks or something? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Or, as I mentioned earlier, some parts 🍋 simply don't make much sense. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Despite the entire game supposedly 🍋 taking place inside a rocket ship, 🍊 some areas are clearly set outside. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Many of the levels don't look like they 🍋 were designed with a rocket ship in mind 🍋 and use tiles that look like stone blocks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the, sort of, 🍋 old-fashioned-looking doors 🍊 look very out-of-place 🍋 inside a rocket ship. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, there's, like, a few 🍋 metal textures in the game 🍋 and some robot enemies, 🍊 but I can [only] assume the 🍋 levels were mostly designed 🍋 before the Sci-Fi theme was added. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the block-pushing areas 🍋 seem to [have been] added on later, 🍊 since they have a very clear 🍋 futuristic look to them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Should you actually finish the game, 🍊 you might be disappointed there's 🍋 no final battle with the 'Overlords' 🍋 in the 'Control Complex'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, there's no 'Control Complex' 🍋 or 'Overlords' mentioned anywhere 🍋 except on the back [of] the box. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 When you exit the final door 🍋 on the top floor, 🍊 you simply get a message that says 🍋 'Mission Complete, Dash'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then 🍋 'Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!!' 🍊 with, like, a dozen 🍋 exclamation points after it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then it just returns 🍋 to the Title Screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Even though I really dislike this game, 🍊 at least "Dash Galaxy" has a somewhat 🍋 unusual concept in execution. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our next game, however, is 🍋 a whole 'nother ball of wax. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Destination Earthstar 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 February [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Imagineering
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay! If "Dash Galaxy" 🍋 wasn't bad enough for ya, 🍋 here's "Destination EarthStar". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I've] got to admit; it takes 🍋 a certain amount of cojones 🍊 to not even have a separate 🍋 Title Screen for your game 🍊 and instead just put in the title and 🍋 credits right in the main game screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was published by Acclaim 🍋 but developed by Imagineering 🍊 (the same folks who made 🍋 "...A Boy and His Blob..."). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Garry Kitchen 🍋 (an Atari 2600 veteran) 🍊 is credited as the designer 🍋 of "Destination EarthStar" 🍊 and Kitchen also worked 🍋 on "...A Boy and His Blob...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But while "...Blob" had a certain 🍋 amount of originality to it 🍊 "...EarthStar" has absolutely none. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "...EarthStar" is one of those 🍋 games, like "Dash Galaxy", 🍊 where the game itself is 🍋 completely divorced from the 🍋 plot, as described in the manual. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It gives you a couple 🍋 pages of backstory 🍊 - something about humans 🍋 captured for a galactic zoo 🍊 who are now returning 🍋 to Earth after many years. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 None of this really matters 🍊 because it has no connection to 🍋 anything that happens in-game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Actually playing "Destination EarthStar", 🍋 you'll find no references to the plot 🍊 (aside from a single sentence of text 🍋 that appears when you beat the game). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you are familiar with the world 🍋 of 1980s Computer Games, 🍊 you will instantly recognize this 🍊 as one of the many, many 🍋 clones of "Star Raiders". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Star Raiders", of course, 🍋 being Atari's very successful and 🍋 influential 1979 Computer Game 🍊 (though "...EarthStar" has one 🍋 very odd twist, as we'll see later). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I'm not sure who, 🍋 in 1990, wanted a knockoff 🍊 of an 11-year-old Atari game, 🍋 but here we are. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "...EarthStar" does look nicer than 🍊 the original "Star Raiders" 🍋 for the Atari 800 or 2600 🍊 but it does look worse than 🍋 the 1986 Atari ST version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So here's how ya play the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The map on the left-hand side 🍋 shows all the planets and enemies 🍋 in the current area that you're in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's eight areas 🍋 (or star systems or something) 🍊 and you must clear all of them 🍋 to beat the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'O's on the areas 🍋 represent planets. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can land on them 🍋 and you'll sometimes get 🍋 restocked on your fuel or weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The numbers are enemy ships 🍊 (the number tells you how many 🍋 enemy ships are in that square). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'B' is a base, 🍋 which repairs your ship, 🍊 and 'A' is an armory, 🍋 which gives you weapons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The combat is not great; 🍋 you just fire at these things 🍊 as they move around 🍋 all over the place. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have laser beams 🍋 which quickly overheat 🍊 so you can't just blast 🍋 enemies non-stop. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The entire game is 🍋 dull and repetitive; 🍊 most [of] the playtime is just simply 🍋 spent cruising around empty space, 🍊 going from one 🍋 point of interest to another. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can go into hyperspace, 🍊 which makes you move 🍋 faster around the map 🍊 - but this also uses up 🍋 a lot of energy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Among "Destination EarthStar"'s 🍋 various eccentricities 🍋 is the control scheme. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, not piloting your ship - 🍋 that's [pretty] standard - 🍊 use the D-Pad to move the ship 🍋 and a button to fire your weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But for everything else, instead of 🍋 using, like, an Options Menu, 🍊 you're required to use 🍋 various button combinations. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, to pause the game you hit the A 🍋 and the B buttons at the same time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 To remove the map grid, 🍋 you press B and Start. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 To turn the music off, 🍋 you pause the game, 🍊 and then unpause, and 🍋 pause the game a second time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This really exposes the Computer Game 🍋 roots of "...EarthStar"'s design. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A keyboard has dozens of keys; 🍋 you can just bind every action 🍋 to a different key. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Imagineering tried 🍋 to do the same thing 🍊 with the N.E.S. controller's 🍋 four buttons, 🍊 as opposed to just 🍋 giving it a Pause Menu, 🍊 like every other N.E.S. game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you defeated all 🍋 the enemies in the system, 🍊 the bad guy's base appears 🍋 and you need to land in it 🍊 and then... we switch to a 🍋 horizontal scrolling Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, wow! 🍊 This looks closer in design 🍋 to "Defender" or something 🍊 than it does to 🍋 most N.E.S. Shooters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We have tiny generic sprites, 🍋 extremely plain backgrounds, 🍋 very boring weapons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 1990 was the year of Shooters 🍋 like "Parodius Da!" and 🍋 "Special Cybernetic Attack Team". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, compared to these, 🍋 this game looks just absurd! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's also difficult as hell, 🍋 with tons of enemies trying 🍋 to ram into you from all sides. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I can imagine all the poor kids 🍋 who got this game as a 🍋 birthday or Christmas present 🍊 and not being very 🍋 pleased with it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 All eight star systems 🍋 are exactly the same 🍊 (except with more enemies to kill) 🍊 and it's kind of hard to imagine 🍋 anyone actually wanting to 🍋 play all the way through this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But if you did, well, after 🍋 blowing up the final enemy base, 🍊 you return to your normal 🍋 first-person view of the control panel 🍊 and the words 🍋 "The people of Earth welcome you... 🍋 Home Again". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And... that's it; 🍋 there's not even any credits, 🍊 since those appeared 🍋 at the beginning. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, great! 🍋 Fantastic! 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 What a game! 🍇



"🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nishimura Kyoutarou Mystery: Super Express Satsujin Jiken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 March 02 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey, guys, do you know what 🍋 we haven't had for a while? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A Murder Mystery Adventure Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Nishimura Kyoutarou Mystery: 🍋 Super Express Satsujin Jiken" 🍊 published by Irem 🍋 and developed by Tose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is actually a 🍋 [pretty] stylish intro. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, we've covered many, many, 🍋 many 'Satsujin Jiken' games 🍋 (or 'Murder Mystery Case' games) 🍊 during 'Chrontendo', 🍋 going all the way back to 🍊 "Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken" 🍋 in 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, you know, these things 🍋 don't really change much. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Someone is murdered, you play as a 🍋 detective trying to solve the mystery, 🍊 and ya spend the game 🍋 'Looking' and 'Asking' 🍊 via the menu on the 🍋 left-hand side [of] the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, a woman 🍋 was murdered on a train. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, we saw the first 🍋 'Nishimura Kyoutarou' game 🍊 back in "...Episode 41", 🍋 released in January 1989. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Blue Train Satsujin Jiken" 🍋 kind of impressed me with its 🍊 high-quality character artwork 🍋 and sort of Noir-ish vibe. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game, however, 🍋 eh... not so much. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Possibly the budget was smaller 🍊 or Irem just wanted a 🍋 different look for the game, 🍊 but the graphics feel a 🍋 bit more conventional 🍊 and it's visually 🍋 a bit more boring. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suspect it also doesn't include a 🍋 completely gratuitous panty shot 🍊 in the game's climax, 🍋 like the first one did. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, as a reminder, Kyoutarou Nishimura 🍋 was a popular Japanese Mystery author, 🍋 who specialized in train-themed mysteries. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from his *many* books, 🍋 there were a bunch of TV shows 🍋 and made-for-TV movies, 🍊 based on his work over the course of 🍋 around... I don't know... a few decades? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'Super Express' in the game's title 🍋 is, I believe, the bullet train express 🍋 line that runs between Tokyo and Osaka. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Anywho, this chick got iced on the train 🍋 (presumably by strangulation). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You go from location to location, 🍋 interrogating witnesses 🍋 and looking for clues. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like most of these types of games, 🍋 this purty much involves just using the 🍋 'Look' and 'Talk' menu options 🍊 until you unlock additional menu options 🍋 that allow you to move to a new location 🍋 and talk to new suspects and witnesses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of these FamiCom mystery games 🍋 have never been translated into English 🍊 and, quite frankly, there's probably 🍋 not really a whole lot of interest 🍋 in these things, outside of Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'Nishimura Kyoutarou' series released 🍋 a few more games over the years 🍋 (well into the DS era) 🍊 but it seems to have finally 🍋 petered out a few years ago. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Incidentally, there is another 🍋 'Nishimura Kyoutarou' game 🍋 for the PC Engine 🍊 that was released in February 1990, 🍋 so we'll be covering that in 'Chronturbo' 🍊 and after that, well, 🍋 we'll be done with the series 🍊 - so that's some good news. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 President no Sentaku 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 March 02 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Another
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hot-B 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, here's one very unique game: 🍋 "President no Sentaku" 🍊 (meaning 'President's Choice' 🍋 or 'President's Decision'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I assumed this was a 🍋 Presidential Election Game of some sort 🍊 (which was great because we just 🍋 had an election in November). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, nope; 🍋 it's a different kind of president. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a Simulation Game, 🍋 in which you are the president of an 🍋 automobile manufacturing company. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this, of course, is from the classic 🍋 team of Hot-B and Another - 🍊 the pair behind "Hoshi no Mirohitu" - 🍋 perhaps the worst J.R.P.G. on the FamiCom 🍊 (which was recently released on the Switch, 🍋 which seems a little odd to me, 🍊 but I guess there is a market 🍋 for that type of junk). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Incidentally, all the music here 🍋 just seems to be lifted 🍋 from various Classical pieces. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, let me say that 🍋 "President no Sentaku" 🍋 is a [pretty] obscure game 🍊 and doesn't seem to be particularly 🍋 well-known, even in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It doesn't even have a 🍋 Japanese Wikipedia article 🍊 and I found very little 🍋 discussion of it online. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Outside of Japan, of course, 🍋 no one's heard of it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no translations available 🍋 and it's one of the relatively few 🍊 FamiCom games to not have any sort 🍋 of guides or reviews on GameFAQs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It is very Japanese-heavy, 🍋 making it impossible to play 🍊 if you aren't reasonably 🍋 fluent in [the] language - 🍊 and also there's so much 🍋 stuff going on here 🍊 that I'd say it's probably [pretty] hard 🍋 to play if you don't have the manual. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Basically, though, as the president, 🍋 you need to make decisions 🍊 and give orders to various 🍋 departments within the company. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We have what looks like a 🍋 Research and Development team 🍊 (which you can put points into 🍋 various attributes of the car). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You could also select different 🍋 types of vehicles to manufacture. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's what appears to be 🍋 a Marketing Department. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One nice little detail 🍋 (maybe the [only] nice little detail) 🍊 is that whenever you 🍋 make a decision, 🍊 like, an official seal gets 🍋 stamped onto the screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if this looks like 🍋 an interesting game, 🍊 well apparently it's actually 🍋 a wretched piece of garbage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The one review I read complained a lot 🍋 about many aspects of this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, completely random events 🍋 co... that you have no control over 🍊 (such as one of your partner 🍋 companies going bankrupt) 🍊 can make it [pretty] much 🍋 impossible to win the game, 🍊 and that you might as well 🍋 reset, if that happens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Certain aspects of running 🍋 the company (like Advertising) 🍊 seem to be totally useless and 🍋 have no impact on the business. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Actually beating the game 🍋 is supposedly [pretty] simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just need to focus on 🍋 pumping out good economy cars 🍊 and keeping the expenses down 🍋 and you'll win. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 To officially beat the game, 🍋 you need to become the biggest 🍋 auto manufacturer in Japan 🍊 and then do the same thing in Europe 🍋 and, finally, in the United States. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, apparently, the Europe 🍋 and U.S. portions of the game 🍋 are exactly the same as Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You basically just start 🍋 again from the beginning 🍊 and just have to beat 🍋 the game two more times - 🍊 but apparently, nothing really 🍋 has changed from the Japan 🍋 segment, so it's really boring. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And who would want to 🍋 lose all their progress 🍊 and then basically have to go 🍋 through the exact same thing 🍋 multiple times in a row? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Certainly no one, right? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so not much really 🍋 to say about this game, 🍊 but there's one last game this 🍋 episode and then we'll be done. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Heavy Barrel 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 March 02 🇯🇵 // 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, here we have our last game 🍊 and maybe the game I 🍋 hated the least, this episode: 🍋 "Heavy Barrel" from Data East. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your mission: Destroy an 🍋 underground artillery base. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Why don't they just bomb 🍋 the hell out of the island 🍊 and then send the guys in 🍋 to mop it up? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And why is this 🍋 artillery base on an island? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Who exactly are they gonna shoot at? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And what are these things? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I was just baffled when I 🍋 played this for the first time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They don't attack you and it's not 🍋 obvious what shooting them does. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It turns out, 🍋 hitting them gives you points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Heavy Barrel" was 🍋 originally an Arcade game, 🍊 so the points thing 🍋 makes sense in that context. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, these guys [only] show up for a few 🍋 seconds and are then never seen again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Shooting enemies will drop these 🍋 things that look like turkey basters 🍋 (but are actually keys). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need them to open the many, 🍋 many locked boxes found 🍋 laying around the island 🍊 though, you can [only] carry 🍋 four keys at a time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Heavy Barrel" is [pretty] clearly 🍋 a clone of "Commando" - 🍊 Capcom's 1985 Arcade game 🍋 which was, of course, ported 🍋 to the FamiCom in 1986. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Heavy Barrel", itself, 🍋 debuted in the Arcades in 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It used a rotary joystick, just like 🍋 "Commando" and "Ikari Warriors" did. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was a typical sensory-overload 🍋 Arcade Shooter 🍊 with large number of enemies, 🍋 lots of explosions, 🍋 and non-stop gunfire sounds, 🍊 as well as grunts from enemies 🍋 when they got shot, 🍊 an announcer screaming things 🍋 like "Go!" and "Attack!" at you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The N.E.S. port is less manic, 🍋 but still [pretty] action-packed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There is one major change, however. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the [N.E.S.] game, there are 🍋 various weapons just lying around 🍊 that you can pick up to replace 🍋 your default peashooter with. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They have limited ammo, but ammo 🍋 refills can be found in locked boxes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And if you lose a special weapon, you'll 🍋 usually find another weapon or two lying 🍋 around before too long. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the Arcade game, weapons can 🍋 [only] be found in locked boxes 🍊 and there's lots of 🍋 locked boxes everywhere. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The keys are purty plentiful, 🍋 but you have no way of 🍋 knowing what's inside the boxes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By comparison, in "Contra" all 🍋 the pickups are clearly marked. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, the pickup for 🍋 the Spread Gun very clearly 🍋 has a large 'S' marked on it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Heavy Barrel", 🍋 every box looks identical. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a very vexing design decision, 🍋 since opening a box has a good 🍋 probability of replacing your preferred 🍋 weapon with a less-useful one. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is especially 🍋 true with the grenades. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are the weak useless Blue Grenades 🍋 and the vastly more powerful Red Grenades. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Losing the Red Grenades, 🍋 right before a Boss fight, 🍋 can be catastrophic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, just like with "Contra", 🍋 the Spread Gun is the way to go 🍊 (or, rather, the 'Pellet Gun', 🍋 as the game calls it). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It just slices through groups 🍋 of Soldiers, Helicopters, 🍋 and most non-Boss enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first Boss, here, is sort of an 🍋 armored vehicle with some Soldier guys. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just drop a few potatoes on him 🍋 and he'll go down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I love that, after he dies, 🍋 the ground texture reappears. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Heavy Barrel" just loves 🍋 Elevator sections. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It feels like half the game 🍋 involves riding on Elevators. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Second Boss is this 🍋 annoying forklift-robot thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This would be super easy 🍋 if I had the Red Grenades 🍊 (or a weapon other than 🍋 the standard peashooter). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one thing I wanted to show in 🍋 this video is the "Heavy Barrel" itself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The 'barrel' in question is not 🍋 a barrel like ya carry pickles in, 🍋 but a gun barrel. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess they (incorrectly) thought 🍋 "Heavy Barrel" would be a 🍋 cool-sounding name for a big gun? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, the gun has been disassembled 🍋 and the parts have been hidden in boxes, 🍋 scattered throughout the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every time you open a box that 🍋 contains a Heavy Barrel part, 🍊 you will see it be added to that little 🍋 box in the lower right-hand corner. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you have all six parts, 🍋 the gun's fully assembled 🍋 and you can wreak havoc. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Though the "Heavy Barrel" 🍋 is not actually very useful. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It shoots a big wide blast 🍋 of energy or something. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Basically, it's an amped-up Spread Gun 🍊 but it [only] lasts for 60 seconds 🍋 and then disappears. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I just happened to get it in a 🍋 section without many enemies, 🍋 so it was sort of wasted. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe it's best to not 🍋 worry about the "Heavy Barrel" 🍊 and instead go for the 🍋 Red Grenades and the Pellet Gun. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For s... big slow-moving Bosses, just 🍋 keep on tossing Red Grenades at it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, "Heavy Barrel" is 🍋 not exactly a terrible game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's sort of ugly, it lacks the, 🍋 sort of, great Action set-pieces 🍋 like we saw in "Super C"; 🍊 as I mentioned, it's probably 🍋 the game that I hated 🍋 the least this episode - 🍊 but there is some 🍋 annoying stuff. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of the Run-and-Gun Games 🍋 keep your character position 🍋 in the middle of the screen 🍊 and the backgrounds 🍋 just scroll as you move. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The classic "Super Mario"-style scrolling. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Heavy Barrel" allows you to 🍋 walk around on the screen 🍊 while the background 🍋 remains stationary 🍊 until you get closer 🍋 to the edge of the screen, 🍋 and then it starts scrolling. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Ikari III" also does 🍋 something very similar. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The problem is that when you get 🍋 close to the edge of the screen 🍊 enemies can just pop right in, 🍋 in front of you, and you 🍋 can walk right into them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's an egregious example. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you start walking upwards, 🍋 you get a little bit past the 🍋 middle of the screen 🍊 and then Blam! 🍋 a tank just teleports in, 🍋 right in front of you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The tank is so large, it takes up 🍋 the upper third of the screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's just so jarring and 🍋 cheap when this happens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It doesn't scroll 🍋 smoothly onto the screen; 🍋 the whole darn thing just appears. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, 🍋 another issue is the boxes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, the contents are not randomized; 🍊 each box will contain the same item 🍋 every time you play the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned before, having the 🍋 Red Grenades or the Flamethrower 🍋 is extremely useful for Boss fights. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, knowing which boxes contain 🍋 those items is going to give you 🍋 a [pretty] big advantage. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Keys are limited and you 🍋 can [only] hold four at a time, 🍊 so you can't just go around 🍋 opening every box until you 🍋 get what you're looking for. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I assume this was added to the game 🍋 to encourage replayability. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Heavy Barrel" is [pretty] damn hard 🍋 until you've made note of 🍋 where to find the right weapons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, as I mentioned, the opening screen 🍋 says you are infiltrating an enemy base. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The actual manual says you 🍋 are going up against terrorists 🍊 who have taken over a 🍋 nuclear missile launch site, 🍋 which makes a bit more sense. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The seventh and final level 🍋 starts off in a tech-based thing 🍊 and then goes 🍋 into some ancient ruins, 🍊 and then there's this guy 🍋 on a little pedestal 🍋 who doesn't really do anything. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It appears that you can't harm him 🍋 and then he flies away? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The Final Boss is this giant mess 🍋 of pixels with pincer arms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He didn't translate very well to the N.E.S. 🍊 but in the Arcade game, he's more 🍋 clearly recognizable as, like, 🍊 a giant mech with a pilot that 🍋 you can see near the head. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe the guy piloting the mech 🍋 is supposed to be that guy 🍋 who disappeared a minute ago? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, these fancy mobile armor suits 🍋 are no match for good old-fashioned 🍋 American spicy pineapples. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Heavy Barrel" maybe stays a little 🍋 bit too true to the Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from the weapons pickups, 🍋 it's a [pretty] faithful port 🍊 - just uglier, with fewer enemies, 🍋 and less explosions. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It doesn't feel 🍋 optimized for the FamiCom, 🍋 the way "Super C" did 🍊 and the 'Heavy Barrel', itself, 🍋 is kind of disappointing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's sort of okay, I guess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, I hope you like this sort of crap 🍊 because "Ikari III" is 🍋 coming up, next episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 56 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, that was painful but we survived. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, Best Game and Worst Game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I really don't know where to go with this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe a 10-way tie for the Worst Game? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If I had to pick the Best, 🍋 I'd probably say "Heavy Barrel"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's trash but it's *almost* fun 🍊 (at least when you're not being 🍋 frustrated by having enemies pop up, 🍋 right in front of your face). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And Worst Game... 🍋 I guess "Destination EarthStar"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just so boring and just... 🍋 I don't know; it doesn't even try. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It just feels like product - 🍋 like generic video game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, coming up next, we have at least 🍋 kind of a strange game from Capcom, 🍊 a port of a rather cute Arcade game, 🍋 and a port of a popular Computer game, 🍊 and (believe it or not) 🍋 a FamiCom Disk System game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's been a while since 🍋 we've seen one of those. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, see ya next time. 🍇🍌
