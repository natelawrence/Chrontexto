👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 5 ✨


✅🌊🍊🍓 Thanks [for] tuning in [to] "...Episode 5" of 'Chrontendo'! 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 Well, this episode is going [to] be a big one. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 In fact, the months of September [and] October 1985 are [probably] the most significant eight weeks in the system's lifespan. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Three major events will occur, this episode. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 First, we'll see the release of a title that'll virtually come to define the FamiCom and the N.E.S. system. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Secondly, we'll see Nintendo take the first step in its effort [to] become the global leader in home video game consoles. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 And, finally, we'll see the emergence of a rivalry that [will] last for nearly the next 20 years. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 [Most of] the games [covered] in this [episode] are Japanese-[only releases]. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 [Only] four were released in the United States. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 [But we] will see the emergence of three new publishers for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 10-Yard Fight 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 August 30 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Irem
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 // Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 Our first game this episode is Irem's "10-Yard Fight" - a [port] of their 1983 Arcade game. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 This was the last game [released] in August 1985. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 You [can] choose your level here - from High School all the [way up to] Super Bowl team. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 High School is [quite] easy. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 [Super] Bowl is quite difficult. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 We'll try College, here - not too bad. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 So, this is definitely the first American Football Game released [for] the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 And, quite frankly, there [really] weren't a whole lot of Football Games [out] there (even for the Arcade) [before] this game [came out] in [1983]. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Why is this? 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Well, American Football is kind of a complicated game, and it's [probably pretty] hard [to] make a video game [out] of it! 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 Nowadays, of course, [Football] Games [are] quite popular! 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Back in 1983, however, making a game that sort of accurately reproduced the game of Football [would] be [pretty] difficult! 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 In fact, the original Arcade [version of] this game was quite a bit different [and] they actually added a number of features for the 1985 FamiCom version. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 So, how does it play? 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Well, don't be fooled; this game is quite simple. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Usually, [what] ya do is ya throw the ball [to] one [of your] lateral receivers and then have him just run up the field! 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 [Of] course, the [other] team [will] try [to] tackle you. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 But if ya get a good head start, [it'll take them quite] a [while to] catch up with you. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 [And] you can also evade their tackles by... moving the D-Pad from left to right. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Obviously, of course, I've gotten a first down, here. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 And, uh, once you [get] all the way, uh, to the goal, you, uh, get a touchdown! 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 [And you're] even [allowed to kick] a [field] goal! 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Basically, you just want to position the arrow right in the middle of the goal posts there, then kick the ball. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 Now, defense is actually a little bit trickier. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Notice there's the timer, but it's going much faster [than] real time. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 Once you [actually] win a game, you'll then go on [to] the next level. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 For example, ya start off High School; you win and [you'll] go [to] College - all [the way up to] Super Bowl. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 [So, for] defense, you have [to] hit either the A [or the] B [button to] select the left or the right player. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 And then you try [to] tackle whoever [has the] ball! 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 I personally find tackling a bit tricky. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 A lot [of] times, I try [to] do a running tackle [and] throw myself at the guy and he just misses completely. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 Occasionally, something interesting [will] happen (for [example, you'll] be able to intercept] a pass, like happens here). 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 So, [this is] a [pretty] fun game. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 I mean, [it] is reasonably addictive. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 It's not very complicated. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Uh... "[Tecmo] Bowl" [would] come [out] a few years later [and], [of] course, was a much better game. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 But, not surprisingly, this game was [released] in the United States. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 [In fact], {it} was actually even one of the launch titles [for] the N.E.S. in America. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Battle City 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 September 09 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 This is Namco's "Battle City"... with one [of] the most minimalistic musical themes you'll find on any Nintendo game. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 [And this is] actually a remake of a 1980 Arcade game from Namco, called "Tank Battalion". 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 Here's the original Arcade version. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 This came [out right around] the same time [as] "Pac-Man" - maybe a few months after "Pac-Man". 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 Namco added a number of features and [obviously] updated the graphics and the sound [to] make "Battle City". 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 {They} added such things [as] power-ups like [a] little grenade, which blows up [everybody on the] screen. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 [And] the object of this game is to [protect your] little gray eagle ({at} the bottom there) from being, uh, blown up by one [of] the enemy tanks. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 In [order] to clear the screen, you have to destroy a c... -- certain number of, uh, each kind of tank. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 Altogether, there's 35 levels. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 After [you] complete them, the game [repeats] itself. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 There's, sort of, your standard tanks. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Then there's the more highly armored tanks; the (like, [well, that] one up there that's [sort] of flashing) -- those take a few hits [to] kill. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 There's the fast-moving tanks. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 [And] this game [can] actually be a bit tough, especially in the later levels, because you [sort] of have to not [only] watch out for your own [hide, but] make sure while you're not working in one area, a tank sneaks down [and] blows up [your], uh -- [your] home base, there. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 [Perhaps] the most interesting thing about this game is [it actually] has a 2-Player cooperative option, where two players [can actually] {be} playing, at the same time, working together. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 {This is} something that [wasn't] really seen [in] a whole [lot] of video games, at this time. 🍇

✅🌊🍊🍓 Really, the 2-Player [cooperative] mode is really the way [to] go [with] this game. 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 There's [also] a construction mode, [sort] of like "ExciteBike". 🍇🍌


✅🌊🍊🍓 But really, uh, this is not a bad game, but you [can sort] of tell that Namco didn't really [put] too much time [and] energy [into] this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Mario Bros. 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Super Mario Bros. Overworld Theme" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 September 13 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, here is the big one: "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game starts off with the -- one [of the] most memorable video game music themes of all time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, it's [not just] the music [that] makes this game great. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, virtually everything about it is great! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you're watching this, I assume you [don't] really need [an introduction to] this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This [is] the game [that] really [sort] of, uh, [put] the Nintendo on the map in [the United] States. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was a launch title [for] the Nintendo in the U.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And in a lot of versions of the N.E.S., [it] was [actually] included as a pack-in game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's often said [that "Super] Mario Bros." is the, uh, biggest selling video game of all time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Some people] say [that's not really] fair, because it -- that's including [the] copies [that] were actually packaged with the N.E.S. system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, if you don't count this game, then "[Super] Mario Bros. 3" is actually the biggest selling video game of all time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Either way, this game was a huge hit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The influence of "Super Mario Bros." on the video game world was enormous! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was the game [that] really helped sell the N.E.S. in [the United] States, and thus it, sort of, [helped revive the] video game market in the U.S.! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, the [quality and] ambition of this game really, [sort] of, transformed what people [thought could] be done on home video game consoles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Super Mario Bros." was not the first side-scrolling platform game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There had been others [before] this and it was, [sort] of, a minor genre, especially on Computers [and] in the Arcades. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably the most successful, uh, side-scrolling Platformer, prior [to] this, was 1984's "Pac-Land". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Probably the high point of these early Arcade side-scrollers was Capcom's, "Ghosts 'n Goblins", which [heat] -- hit the Arcades right about the same time [that] "[Super] Mario Bros." came [out on] the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Ghosts 'n Goblins" also [had a very] similar 'rescue the princess' kind of plot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, the Platforming elements in both these games were [pretty] simple compared [to] "[Super Mario] Bros.". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We won't see [it] happen immediately, of course, [but] due [to the success] of this game, side-scrolling [and] Platforming [and that sorta] thing [really] kind of became this dominant genre for [console] games [for quite] a while. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This [really] lasted, up until the '90s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure ya [recall] Sega's 'Sonic the Hedgehog' series being quite [popular in] the '90s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] would really take the PlayStation [and] the transition [to] 3D graphics to, sort of, cause the, uh, Platformer [to] lose its popularity. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, they still make 'Mario Bros.' games [to] this day. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Again, note how [great] Koji Kondo's music is [for] this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Suddenly, [it] changes [from] being so sunny [and] peppy [to] being more mysterious [and] dark - {it} really helps set the mood [for] this level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, the level [design] is great too. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Suddenly there's] a black background, [the] colors [are] all blue - kinda mysterious looking. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 How [many] other (really) video games [at] this time (especially on a Nintendo) really had [that kind] of [ability to], like, set a mood like this? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You certainly couldn't say the same about games like "Flappy". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And even Nintendo's games, like, uh, "Wrecking Crew", didn't really have the same successful fusion of visuals [and] music. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Super Mario Bros." borrows a [lot of] things from other games, like the [invulnerability] power-up, obviously, comes originally [from] "Pac-Man". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] from games like "...Tower of Druaga", it adds the, uh, concept of lots of hidden things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There [are] all kinds of things like this hidden coin room that you [might] not find [the first] few times you play this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And], of course, one [of the] most well-known hidden things [in] this, uh, game is the Warp Rooms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [This], of course, [will] allow the experienced gamer to play the entire game [a little] more quickly [without] having [to] go through every [single] level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And it] is [pretty] cool [the] first time ya [happen to actually] find a Warp Zone. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's [several] of [them] hidden throughout the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another really [notable] thing [about "Super] Mario Bros." is its general cohesiveness. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [If] ya look at a lot [of] games (like "Kung-Fu", for example) I mean, the enemies really don't seem [to] have [anything in] common. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There're, sort of, random things kind of thrown in there, whereas here, everything seems [to] come from the same alien world. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] there's, [sort] of, like, a logical progression from the enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, the koopas you [can] jump on [and] kill them; the spinies, you cannot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later we'll have Buzzy Beetles which you [can] step on, but [fireballs] won't harm. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] the levels all transition together nicely. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya know, [at] the end of one level you crawl [into] a pipe [and] then it plops you [down into] the ocean. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then [at the] end of *that* level, you crawl [into] a pipe [and it] takes {ya} back [out onto] dry land. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] the *world* in "Super Mario Bros." is amazingly well-realized. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There actually is a real internal [logic] to it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even though the levels are always changing, [and there's] a lot of variety in [what] you do, nothing ever [really] seems [out] of place or inappropriate. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Playing this game, you really sorta get a feel for what the Mushroom Kingdom is like. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The idea behind this level [is that] ya do a [lot] of jumping on turtle shells [and] running. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Of] course, [I'm not] really doing [that] very well, at the moment. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game does [definitely] keep throwing new things [at] you [and] the difficulty level ramps up very, very gently. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "[Super Mario] Bros." is [not] really a hard game, but [it] is such a fun [game that] even the most hardcore gamers [don't] really complain [about it] being too easy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And "Super Mario Bros." [is] also a very *fair* game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You never really die because of something that's the game's fault; [it's pretty much] always *[your]* fault. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You never really feel, 'Oh', you know, 'The game is, uh -- is cheating [or] something.' or 'The controls [are] bad.'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing [about 'Super Mario] Bros." is [that] the controls are very good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Definitely the early Nintendo game designers had difficulty getting games to control well, but Nintendo themselves certainly had no such problems with this game, because it handles better than just about any early FamiCom game - [and] better [than] actually a lot [of the] later games as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Playing through all these FamiCom games, [I'm] actually often *amazed* [at] how often bad controls is a serious issue [with] these games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But with "[Super Mario] Bros." the controls [are] always [buttery] smooth. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Every fourth level is a dungeon level, which actually feazure... -- features a boss [at] the end. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Remember], [at] this stage, having bosses [at] the end of levels was [not] yet a video game cliche. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [I] mean, sure, games did *have* them, but a lot of games didn't, as, in fact, most [of] the games [we've been] playing on the FamiCom so far [didn't really] *have* a boss. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, every time [you] defeat King -- King Koopa you get the great, uh, [Sorry] '...our princess [is] in another castle!' bit of business. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned earlier, one [of] the things [this] game borrowed from "...Tower of Druaga" was [the] -- having various [little, sort] of, *hidden* things scattered throughout the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, here's one [of little] hidden vines you [can find that] takes [ya] to a special [little] Coin World. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some [of] the other ones, of course, have you jumping around on [little] clouds. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But this definitely adds [to] the game's replayability. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] play this game again [and] again, ya know, keep tryin' [to find] more *things*, [and, of] course, [collect] more coins [as] well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One [of] the things "[Super Mario] Bros." added [to] the video game lexicon was, [sort] of, running [around], collecting some [sort] of weird little objects (like a coin [or] something like that). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if I were [to] sum [up] some [of] the ways this game [influenced] future video games, we'd say, first [of] all, [it] did, [in] fact, help [popularize] the side-scrolling Platformer, as well [as], uh, side-scrolling in general. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It [helped popularize] games [with] some [sort] of rudimentary plot, [and] some sort of [concrete] goal [at] the end [of] the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also [quite important] were the idea [of] power-ups (such [as] the *Mushroom*, or the temporary [invulnerability] afforded by the *Stars*), the [collecting] of random trinkets (such as *Coins*), the various hidden bonus objects [and] rooms found throughout the *game*, [and] the [fact that] this game [just raised] the bar, in terms of graphics, controls, music, and design [for] the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Additionally*, the success of "Super *Mario* Bros." *encouraged* Nintendo [to] work on more large ambitious *games*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Their next *big* [project will] be coming [out] in [February] of 1986. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here we have [the] final level of the game [with] the *final boss*, the *real* King Koopa; all the others were [just] *fakes*, apparently. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You kill him [in pretty much the] same way you kill all the rest, [and] then you get [to] meet the real Princess *Mushroom*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [She's actually quite] a [bit] taller than I expected... and *really not that good-looking*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, this being an early title, Nintendo [couldn't just] l... -- have the game [end, there]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'd n...i... -- then [get] to play a, uh, second more *difficult version* of "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *So*, there we have "[Super Mario] Bros.", the game [that] helped usher in the age of modern day video gaming - and the game [that] really [took] the FamiCom from its infancy to [its] adulthood. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It won't] happen *immediately*, of course, [but] over the [next] few [months, we'll] slowly start to see "[Super] Mario Bros."' influence creeping [into] other FamiCom games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pooyan 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 September 20 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hopefully [you're enjoying] some [of] the craziest video game opening music ever, along [with] the very cute [little] opening *scene*, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, [this] is *"Pooyan"*, a [port] of Konami's 1982 *Arcade* game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Coming [out only] around a week [or] so after "[Super Mario] Bros.", this [must] seem [like] a [bit] of a co... -- [disappointment in] comparison, but really, [it shouldn't] be. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It's actually] a very [cute little] Arcade game, and [this is] a very [accurate] port. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The graphics have been downgraded [just] a [little] bit, [but] the game [pretty] much plays [exactly like] the Arcade version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The [subject matter] of this game *is* a little *unusual*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You play a mother *pig*, tryin' [to protect your] *young* ones* [against an endless *onslaught*] of *ravenous wolves*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly enough, the [wolves are] *attacking* by, uh, using helium *balloons*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The [object], of course, is to [prevent] the [wolves] from reaching the *ground*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If they do, they'll climb up the ladders and, uh, begin harassing you from the ladders. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You'd normally use arrows, but *occasionally* you'll get what *appears* [to] be a *ham hock*, which you [can shoot at] the [wolves]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This ham hock [will] travel [right] through several enemies and [knock them] all down. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Again, we have a very cute entertaining [little] cutscene, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The second level is [slightly] more [difficult]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here the wolves [are] trying [to] reach the cliff above [to] get [to] the rock [and] push [that] rock down the cliff [onto] your head. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing [that] makes [this] level a [bit] more difficult is [that] there *is* occasionally a, uh, lighter-[colored] *pink* wolf, [that's] much more [difficult] to hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once [enough] wolves get near, up {at} the top, they will knock the [rock] down [onto] you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah. There's that pink wolf, right there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [have to] kill him [before ya actually can] finish [the] level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] there we go. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] of course, as you [can] imagine, there's also a Bonus Round [as] well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And these two levels simply [repeat] over [and] over again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hopefully you enjoy this kind of old-school [Arcade] action because *really*, [you're *not*] going [to] see too much [of] it [for] the FamiCom after *this*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After this, you're [only] gonna see a *handful* [of] these old 1980s *Arcade games* ported [for] the [FamiCom]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [What you're] going [to] see instead is [actually quite] a few, uh, side-scrolling Platform-type Games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly enough, this *game* was [actually] published by Hudson Soft. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm [not] really sure why this is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I do show [that] Konami [actually developed] this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... They were [already publishing] games [for the] FamiCom, so why Hudson [published] this, I'm -- [I'm not] really sure. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This [actually] looks very, very similar to an M.S.X. port of this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I [believe] this FamiCom version may have been based on the M.S.X. version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I know [that] Hudson [Soft] published [that as] well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Other [than that, there's not] much [to] say [about] "Pooyan" other than [it's] good old-fashioned Arcade fun. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 City Connection 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 September 27 🇯🇵 // 1988 May [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hect | NMK
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] this [is] a [port] of Jaleco's 1985 Arcade game, "City Connection". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Admittedly, [it] has some rather catchy music, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] this game actually doesn't] really look half bad, at least for a Jaleco game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It's] not nearly [as] colorful as the Arcade version, [but it] looks [pretty] decent! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In this game you control a red Honda City, which is a kind of a hatchback [that] was [only released in] Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Apparently], you have [some sort] of, uh, [paint] brush [or] something hooked up [to] the rear bumper because, as you drive, you turn the road white. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Naturally, the [police] wanna [put an end to your career] vandalism, so, of course, they, uh... ([well, they don't really] try [to] catch you, [but they] do) sort of, drive [around] randomly [and] you'll crash [if] you [hit] them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Luckily*, the road is full of *oil* cans, which you [can] pick up and throw [at *police*] cars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This [will] allow you to [knock] them off the road. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Far* more *dangerous* than the police are the pink cats you kit... -- [occasionally] come across [in the middle] of a road. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Hitting] one of *those* [will] end [your little] *joyride*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, this is [really *not*] a [great] *game*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... [Part of] the [problem] is it's kind of [difficult to] control. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... What are -- I'm tryin' [to] do here is [actually] to jump on [to] the next *level* (um, something that I personally find very difficult [to] do). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've painted the entire road, you'll move on [to] the next level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I [believe] this [first level] here is [supposed to] be in [New] York. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One strange thing is I've heard (I've read online, [that] is) [that] the title was [perhaps] inspired by the Emmanuel Lewis song, "City Connection". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's Emmanuel Lewis of, uh, TV's, uh, 'Webster' fame. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Supposedly] the song was [quite popular in] Japan at this time [and] could [have], perhaps, inspired the name [of] the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I [suppose] that's [possible, but it] does seem [a little unlikely to] me. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hyper Sports 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 September 27 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 September of 1985's [last] games [for] the FamiCom was "Hyper [Sports]". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] this is a *port* of the [1984] *Arcade* game [of] the same *name* by *Konami*, which is a sequel [to] the [1983] Arcade game, "Hyper Olympic"! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I [discussed] "Hyper Olympic" last episode, but a few things [about] that game, uh, [will] bear [repeating], here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Just] like "Hyper Olympic", "Hyper [Sports]", was *missing* a few games when [ported to] the *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *Arcade* version has *seven* events; the FamiCom version [only] has *four*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Swimming, Horse Racing, [and] then Weightlifting were [cut from] the home version. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first event is Skeet Shooting, as you see, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You simply [hit] the button [and] shoot the target, as it goes [into] a [little] red box. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The next event is the *Triple Jump*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to actually jump *three* times and try [to] land in the sandpit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need [to control] the angle of each jump. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After this is *Archery*, [and] the last [event] is the *Pole* Vault. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, something [to] remember is [that] "*Hyper* [Olympic]" was released in the U.S., under the *Arcade* name of "Track & Field". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Naturally, the *FamiCom* version, when [ported to] the N.E.S., was released under that name as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the game for the N.E.S. we call "Track & Field" actually has both "Hyper Olympic" and "Hyper Sports" together. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That is, it takes the *four* events from "Hyper Olympic" [and] the four [events] from "*Hyper* Sports" [and puts them together into] one game, so [it's really, sort] of, both games combined. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Other [than] the events being different, "*Hyper* Sports" is really [pretty] much [identical] in style and feel to **"Hyper Olympic"*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Again, [it's still] a fun [little] *game* - something you [can] certainly practice [and get better] at. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [world] records are [displayed at] the end [of] the game, [so] you [can] -- I guess your [ultimate] goal [is to] try [to] compete with those. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every time you [complete] all four events, the, uh, qualification becomes a [little bit] more difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Probably] the trickiest event is the *Pole Vault*, as you can see, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You actually have to have *[pretty]* good *timing*... on [your] jump [in] order to avoid hitting the -- the bar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah! I finally made it, there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, if you liked "Hyper *Olympic*", I suspect you'll [probably] like this game, as *well*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Route 16 Turbo 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 October 04 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sunsoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is "Route 16 *Turbo*" by Sunsoft. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *"Route 16"* was a 1981 *Arcade* game [developed] by Sunsoft [and Tecmo]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At that time, [Tecmo] was known as Tehkan. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Notice there's actually a difficulty selection option here, or rather Level -- Level Select, [as] they call it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this game is, sort of, an *enhanced* [port] or a remake of the original "[Route] 16". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like with "*Super* Arabian", Sunsoft [has] added some additional features, upgraded the graphics [et] cetera for the FamiCom version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Since this game originally came out [in] 1981, it's not [surprising to] see why they made [a] few changes to it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, in this game, you [are] controlling the blue-green car, there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is [to] drive around the *city* and, on certain blocks, you [will] find hidden some sort of *treasure*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Usually a bag of Yen or {a} piece of jewelry (something along those lines); you have [to] collect all of those. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Notice [that] this [particular], uh, treasure [actually] changes from a bag of Yen to an oil slick, on occasion. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, the *unusual* thing about this game is, sort of, the dual-screen selection, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have both the, uh, wide view of the entire city; then you have the views of each individual maze. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 That's *actually* one of the annoying things *about* this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At least when you first start playing a *level* [and] you exit from the maze [out onto] the main *city*, sometimes it's kind of hard [to] find [your] vehicle. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll see this, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you, uh, enter... or [exit] the *maze*... where exactly *are* you? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, [it might] *take* you a second [to] pick out the tiny turquoise [dot that represents your] vehicle on this large *screen*, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I've [actually *crashed* a] few times because I [couldn't find] my vehicle and another car [hit] me [while] I was still looking for it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *here* we have the infamous Swastika Room maze. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {I'm} not really sure what they were thinking when they came up with this one. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, {this is} not the best game ever, [but] it's certainly [not] a *bad* game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a *hell* of a [lot] better [than] "*Super* Arabian"; *that's* [for] sure! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In case you're wondering what the name "Route 16..." is [actually] referring to, well, there *is* a freeway [that] runs [around] *Tokyo* called 'Route 16'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game [probably] references [that] freeway. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Challenger 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 October 15 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Real-Time Action-Adventure. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, this is "Challenger" by Hudson Soft. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [This is not] a [port of [anything; this] is actually an original [for] the FamiCom, more or less. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is really [a bit] of a cheat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually a new game [with an] old game stuck on the [beginning]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One [unique] feature is the ability to choose among many [different] levels of difficulty. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, even the easiest is a [little] on the hard side. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Now], the [first part] here is called 'Stop the Express'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have a [kidnapped] princess... in a train. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And], of course, many pink birds *attack* you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, you were equipped with *many, many throwing* knives. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *apparently* your character, [here, is some sort] of Indiana Jones-type adventurer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this [first part] of the game is basically a reworked version of an *earlier* game from *1983* by [Hudson] Soft, called "Stop the *Express*". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game was [released] for computers - Commodore 64s, [and] Sinclairs, [and] tho... -- [that sort] of thing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The second *longer* [part of] the game is very, very *different*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] what is interesting is [that] *this* game [features a lot] of [horizontal] scrolling, [yet it] came [out only] a *month* after "[Super] Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, this [can't] be a coincidence. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hudson Soft had a [pretty] good relationship with Nintendo [at] this time, so [I can only] assume the developers [of] this game had access to [an] early version of "[Super] Mario Bros." [and, sort] of, [planned] this game accordingly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the *second* (and much *longer*) [part of] the game is actually [completely] different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly enough, this game features full vertical [and] *horizontal* scrolling, which was *quite* unusual at the time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In [a lot] of ways, this game is, [sort] of, a [predecessor to] "...Zelda" - [only] much, much *worse*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *"Challenger"* is *definitely not* a good game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from the choppy *scrolling* [and] stupid *character animation*, there *are* a lot of *gameplay* issues. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Take the pink ghosts, [for] example; they're much faster [than] you, [your] knives [can't hurt] them, [and] when they *hit* [you, you] become *immobile* for a second - spinning around [and] *around*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This allows the ghost [to hit] you *again*; other ghosts [often] move in [and] *swarm* you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Therefore, being [hit] by [one of these] things [often] means [instant] death. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, yes, [and when] you see a *power-up*, like that *knife*, don't *touch* it; [it'll] *kill* you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [actually] have [to] throw a knife [at it, instead]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 When you come across the *Skeleton* guarding the entrance [to] the *Ziggurat*, you [can't] kill him using your *knives*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have to randomly kill enemies [until ya havs... -- happen [to] come across one [of] the random *power-ups* [that] kills [everything] on-screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This wouldn't be [so] *bad* [if there] wasn't a *timer*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once [you're inside] the Ziggurat, you have [to] do a [little bit of annoying] platforming, [in] order [to get what] appears [to] be a piece of jewelry... [but] the game [refers] to as a 'keyword'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've [located and] obtained the six [or] seven keywords [in] this game, you [can] go on [to] the final cave [and] face the final boss. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a strange part; 'arijigoku' means 'antlion'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently, you've [fallen into] a giant antlion *sand* trap. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Japanese games *seem* [to] have some sort of fascination with *antlions*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Think of "*Phantasy* Star", [for] example. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *actual overworld* on this game is [pretty] good-sized [and] ya *[will]* [spend] some time looking [for] all the *keywords*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] the *graphics* ([for] example, [in] the final, uh, *level*, here) are *actually* [pretty] *nice*-looking. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [What] *is odd* is the way [that] the *two parts* [of] the game (the 'Stop the Express' [and] this [later exploration part) *really* don't] seem [to] have [anything] {to} *do* [with] each other. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It's] a [little] strange the way [you] move from modern Japanese commuter train... to a strange world filled with *pyramids*, skeletons, [and] giant *antlions*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Still*, Hudson [Soft] should [get credit for] tryin' [to make] a game [as] different [and] unique [as] this one; [there] was *really* nothing *like* [it] on FamiCom, so *far*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And it *is* quite *eerie* the way the game seems [to] look forward [to] the, uh -- "...Zelda". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Too bad the game is so frustrating [and unenjoyable to] actually play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Even] on the [easiest] level setting, the game [is] a [little] *tough* - *mostly* because [of] those damn frustrating pink ghosts. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 {It} *doesn't* really *take* too long [to] play [through] the game *once*, so it's *[definitely]* worth a look-see. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 Launching the N.E.S. in the U.S.A. ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Atypically, [only] two games ("Route 16 Turbo" and *"Challenger"*) were [released for] the FamiCom [in] October of 1985. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, *something else* [happened that] month [that] made [it] one of the most significant [months] in Nintendo *history*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On October 18th, the Nintendo *Entertainment* System was released in the [United] States. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo had been looking [to] get the FamiCom in the United States since [1983], even talking to Atari for a possible [distribution] deal, [at] one point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Nintendo* developed several *prototypes* [for] the U.S. version [of] the FamiCom, but U.S. retailers t... -- showed no signs of interest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Eventually], Nintendo settled on the boxy gray [design that] we all know [and] love. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There *were* some [design] changes *made*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 FamiCom [and] N.E.S. [cartridges] were [not] compatible {with} each other. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And U.S. [cartridges] had a lockout chip that would prevent unlicensed games [from] being played on {the} machine. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *controllers* were now *detachable*, making them much easier [to] *replace*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Additionally*, the *microphone* found on one [of] the *FamiCom* controllers was *scrapped*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unable [to] *find* anyone [interested] in *distributing* the N.E.S. {in the} [United] States, *Nintendo decided* [to distribute it] *themselves*, [starting] off [with] a *test* market of New York *City*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *original* bundle *available* featured the *console*, *R.O.B.*, [and] the *Light Gun*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *system* [sold quite] well [for] the holiday season of 1985 in New York (around 90,000 units) thus prompting Nintendo [to] try [to] market [it in] *other* cities, [starting] with Los *Angeles* in [February] *1986*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 18 games were available on the launch. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The two R.O.B. titles, the three Light Gun titles, "Super [Mario] Bros.", "Mach Rider", "10-Yard Fight", [and] numerous older titles were all available. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *cover [art]* was changed [for] all of these [releases]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Gone were the typical cartoony drawings on the [front of] the *FamiCom* boxes, [replaced] by blown-up sprites [from] the games themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Over the next *year*, Nintendo released a *handful* of titles [for] the system, including some [of] their back-catalogue titles, [such as] "Urban Champion" [and] "Donkey Kong". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Finally*, [in] October of 1986, a few titles [from] outside *developers* were released in the United States, starting with a few from *Bandai*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then in November, Capcom released [a] couple titles, such [as] "1942", [and] "Ghosts 'n Goblins". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo had some very strict rules regarding the licensing of titles for the N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In [order] to assure *consumers* of the quality [of] the *product*, in the [United] States every game for the Nintendo had Nintendo's Seal of *Quality* on it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, this didn't stop a lot of *terrible* games from being *released*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By *fall of 1986*, the N.E.S. was available nationwide. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] was a *huge hit* and was *the* hot item for Christmas of 1986. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By the end [of] the year, [it had] sold a *million units*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Home video game consoles became [popular], once again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo totally dominated the [field] in the U.S. - and, within a few years, video games were, once again, a multi-billion dollar business. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mach Rider 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 November 21 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another [great little] musical theme here from Nintendo's "Mach Rider". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you [can] see, this game has a few different play options. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {We'll} take a look [at the] 'Fighting Course' first. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [We're starting to] see much more [involved introduction] scenes, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This one has {a} [little bit] of a plot [integrated] into it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {It's} sort of, a Science-Fiction-themed, uh, behind the vehicle, *motorcycle* Racer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And [your] motorcycle [is] actually armed with some [sort] of *machine* gun - [and] the [object, of] course, is to [not] crash [and] to also [shoot] down enemy vehicles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The *story* [behind] "Mach Rider" involves Earth freeways being invaded by some [sort] of alien *race*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Your] job is [to] cruise around on a *motorcycle* and wipe them *out*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Apparently*, the freeways [of] the future [are pretty] trashed; there's oil barrels laying around everywhere, not [to] mention all kinds of oil puddles, water puddles, [and] *rocks*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from enemy vehicles, you [have] to avoid these obstacles [as] well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, *[this]* game came out [only] around a month after "[Super Mario] Bros.", so [it] must [have] been developed around the same time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, it's not nearly {as} *ambitious*, but [it's] certainly [not] a bad [little] Racer Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *One* unusual thing [about] this game is [it was *actually] released* in the [United] States before *Japan*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It] was a *launch* title [for] the N.E.S.; {it} didn't come out in Japan until *November*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Because this *was* a launch title for the N.E.S., this game probably has a better reputation than [it] actually warrants. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I do love the way that it informs you that, 'You are Mach Rider!', in between every single level (as if you [would] somehow forget). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The controls [in] this game are *decent*, if not *great*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing is, [you] do get to go *awfully* fast in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once [you're at] top speed, you [can] actually barely see the track [anymore]; you often can't see things [as you're] going [around] *corners*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, you [can't] really slow down easily, *either*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you slow down beyond, uh, fourth gear, cars [will sneak] up behind you [and] actually crash *[into]* you, as you see, there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If nothing else, this game does a very cool, [sort] of, death animation. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing [that] is [fascinating about] this game is [that] this was the first, sort of, Science-Fiction-themed game Nintendo came [out] with. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the other play modes: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... There is this one *here*, [in] which you simply [have to] go [through] the level [and beat] a certain *time*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [last] gameplay mode is where you go through a level in a certain time, but there's no additional opponents on the road. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, just like "ExciteBike", there's a 'Design' option [as] well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, my final verdict on this game is [that] it's a decent little Racing Game, [but perhaps not as] good [as its] fans might think [it] is. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 Enter SEGA ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 In October of 1985, Nintendo had [every] reason [to] be happy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They [had just released] their crowning achievement [for] the FamiCom, "[Super Mario] Bros.", they had completely *dominated* the Japanese *video game* market, [and] were now [preparing to] do so in the U.S. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [At] this *time*, they really had no competition. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Atari *2600* was still around, [but it] now [seemed] like an ancient *relic*, compared to the *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *However*, dark clouds were on the [horizon]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Ironically*, on October *20th* (a mere *two days* after the N.E.S.' debut [in the United] States) *Sega* released *their* new 8-bit system, the SG-1000 Mark III, later [to] be known as the Sega Master System. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [For] the first time since the debut of the FamiCom, Nintendo had a potential rival. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Sega* was one of the major established Japanese *Arcade* game designers, and the [only] one *not* releasing games [for] the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Amazingly*, their *first* home console, the SG-1000 Mark I, predated the FamiCom; it was test marketed in *1981*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the *Mark I* was never widely distributed [and] really [wasn't that] interesting of a system; not [that] many games [were released] for it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the Mark III was a whole 'nother story, as it was *technically* [superior] to the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While still an *8-bit system*, the Mark III had a faster processor, better colors, [and] could more [accurately reproduce] the current Arcade games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [To] *see* this, let's take a look [at] the *FamiCom version* of "Space Harrier". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Certainly, this looks very little like the original Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, compare [it to] the Sega Master System version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you [can] see, *Nintendo* should have [every] *reason* [to] be *worried* by the emergence of this new competitor. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As it *turns* out, *Sega* never claimed Nintendo's throne, but certainly gave them a good run [for] their money. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though it is widely considered [to] be a *failure*, the *Sega [Master System] actually sold quite well in Europe, Australia, [and] *Brazil* - eventually going on [to] sell *around* 13 million *units*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Sega's *next* system the Mega Drive/Genesis was even *more successful*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the early *'90s*, [it] even ended Nintendo's *dominance* of the North American market. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Sega* officially left the home console market in 2001, with the failure of the Dreamcast. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *However*, in 1985, they certainly must [have] worried Nintendo just a *little*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The FamiCom was no longer the most [technologically] advanced system on the market, and suddenly they have a rival [for] video game consumer's money. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kinnikuman Muscle Tag Match 🇯🇵 // M.U.S.C.L.E. 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 November 08 🇯🇵 // 1986 October [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I [don't] even know where [to] begin [with] this one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is "Kinnikuman", [published] by Bandai (known as "M.U.S.C.L.E." in the [United] States). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [This is] a *Wrestling* Game [and] it's *based* on a very popular Japanese manga [and] anime. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Kinnikuman' is more [or] less [about] a group of superhero wrestlers; the name means 'muscleman' [in] Japanese. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the United States, a series of, uh, small *toys* [were released, under] the name 'M.U.S.C.L.E.' (Millions of Unusual Small Creatures Lurking Everywhere). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was the [first] game [for] the FamiCom [released] by *Bandai*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Bandai has been [around since] the *1950s*, [and are] *primarily* a company [that] licenses, uh, [popular] manga [and] *cartoon* characters [into] *toys*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They [also] do a [little bit] of, uh, manufacture [and distribution] of anime as *well*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, they [are *not* primarily] a video game *company*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And this is what] happens when companies, uh, [start] making games [for] the FamiCom, *lured* by the [success] of the *console*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] very easily end up with [utterly] reprehensible games, such [as] this one. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game [certainly] *looks* bad, but it *also* plays *terribly*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You control a team [of] wrestlers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [This is actually] tag team wrestling; you [can] go [to] the corner [and] call [in] the other [teammates at any time], if ya wish. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You [only] have two moves, a Punch and a Jump. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, there are variations on this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [For] example, if you jump [against] the ropes, you [will jump] backwards [and] perhaps knock [your opponent] over. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can also] flip [your opponent] over [your] head [and] do, [sort] of, a pile driver. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the *mechanics* [and] controls [of] this game are utterly, utterly terrible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing [that] happens here [is] occasionally some [sort] of [little] *power-up ball* [will] be tossed [into] the ring. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If [your] computer opponent catches it, he'll [probably] instantly *kill* you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, this guy, right here, when he gets it, does some kind of crazy *fire* attack and, uh, jumps on [top of] you [and ya [pretty] much lose control your character *completely* as your health is slowly drained away. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's really [not] much [ya can] do, if the other guy happens [to] catch this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And here's the U.S. version, "M.U.S.C.L.E." - s... -- slightly [different] character [selection]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *One* very intriguing thing *[about]* this game is *this*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Bandai* [didn't] really develop their own *video* games; there actually is no developer *listed* on this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's *[rumored]* this game was [actually developed] by the infamous company, Tose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Tose* is a very *large* Kyoto-[based] *company*, which [has developed *apparently*] over a [thousand] *games* since, first being formed [around] 1980 or so. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] the unusual thing is, *Tose* never actually takes *credit* [for] these games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Video game companies [or developers] basically *hire* them [when] they [want] a game developed anonymously. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Tose's name does [not] appear on the *packaging*, [and] they [will *often*] go so far as to actually use fake programmer names in the credits. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Reportedly, Tose [has] actually [developed] a [lot] of Bandai's games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Perhaps [this is] one [of] the [reasons] why so many of Bandai's games [are] so terrible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, the fact that tie-in games like this [are] usually [just] released very [quickly] {to} [make a] quick buck anyway, [I'm] sure, [also has] something [to] do [with] it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'd go [so] far [as to] say [this is probably] actually *the* worst *game* released [for] the FamiCom, *so far*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 With a game this *bad*, you'd think *Nintendo* would do everything in its *power* to hide the [fact that it] exists. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Incredibly*, [just] the [opposite] occurred. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When third-[party] games finally [started] coming [out for] the N.E.S., in October of [1986, this was] actually one [of] the first two games [released]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Considering] all the [great] games [that] were never [released] in the [United] States, this is utterly mind-boggling. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sky Destroyer 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 November 14 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito | Home Data
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The music [to] "Sky [Destroyer]" *seems* [to] be, [sort] of, a *relative* of the theme to "Raiders [of] the Lost Ark". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you [can] see, this is a pseudo-3D Aerial *Combat* Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {It} looks a [lot] like *"AfterBurner"*, [which would] come [out in about] two years after this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Of] course, it's [not] nearly [as] *exciting* [as] "AfterBurner". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Just] like *"1942"*, this game seems {to} take place during World War II: the Battle of [the] Pacific. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Except, [in] *this* case, you're a *Japanese* fighter, battling *U.S.* forces. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya *have* both a machine gun [and] a torpedo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What's the *torpedo for*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, every *once* in a while you'll come [across] a, uh, *island* or a (uh... Oops! I got shot down, there.) -- you'll come [across] an island, or a naval vessel [that] you [can] fire torpedoes [at]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game was released by *Taito* [and], as *far* as I can tell, it's *not* a *port* of an earlier *game*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Major developers like Taito were *just* now starting to develop games t... -- specifically *for* the *FamiCom*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *One* problem with this game is [it's actually] a [little bit] on the *formless* side. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There *really* aren't *levels* [or] anything [like that]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [just, sort] of, fly around forever shooting *planes*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A nice [little] *detail* is that the, uh, *sky* changes *color* from day [to night to] dusk [to] dawn [et] cetera, [et] cetera. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And *occasionally* ya come across [little *Bonus* Rounds (like those *red* planes [I just] shot down) [and] sometimes even, [sort] of, like, a boss-type thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll get, like, either a Ship like this ya [have to] torpedo - or [you'll] come across a large *Bomber*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have [to shoot out] all the Bomber's *engines*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is kind of difficult as they *tend* to run away [pretty] *quickly*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah, there's a Bomber, now. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, *while* I really wouldn't call this a *bad* game, I'd say the lack of variety makes it just a little [bit] on the *boring* side. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's *certainly* not anywhere nearly [as] exciting [as] "AfterBurner". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I *will* admit the pseudo-3D graphics [are pretty] good [for] this vintage. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ninja Jajamaru Kun 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 November 15 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our next game is "Ninja Jajamaru Kun". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [This] is, [sort] of, a *sequel* [to] Jaleco's *"Ninja-kun..."*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Unlike] "*Ninja*-kun...", this game [isn't] based on [an] *Arcade* game; it *appears* [to] be an N.E.S. (or rather a FamiCom) original. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was never [released] in the [United] States, of course. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I had always assumed [that] this character was the same character [that] was in "Ninja-kun...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [However], the Wikipedia [article] on this game states [it's] actually Ninja-kun's *[little] brother*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He looks [exactly like] the guy in "Ninja-kun...", so it's really hard [to] say, but [I'll]... guess [I'll take] their word for [it]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [This is] the first in this, uh, series of 'Ninja Jajamaru' games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [There's actually quite] a few of them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And they're still making them, [to] this day, [for] some reason. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, [it's not really] a bad game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [This is] one [of] those games [that only] has a couple different levels [that just, sort] of, repeat indefinitely. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... The foes [get] harder [and] harder. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly enough, this is [yet] another game that came out around the same time as "[Super] Mario..." [that] features a [kidnapped] princess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's her [up at] the top, there, Princess Sakura. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The [object] is to rescue her. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Well], you actually do that by, uh, killing all the enemies off [in] each screen; you [can] then go on [to] the [next] screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can] find a [lot] of, like, [little hidden] bonuses in the, uh, little [brick] walls [that] separate the floors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The gameplay mechanics [are pretty] similar [to] "Ninja-kun...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can], uh, stun [an enemy ...eye -- by -- by [hitting] them [and] then you [can] actually, uh, take them [out] by using [your little] throwing star on [them]. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A few things have been added [to] this game from "Ninja-kun...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... [For] example, the princess drops little *power-ups* [that] you [can] catch (things [that'll] make your weapon travel further [or] make you run faster). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, one of the *coolest* things [is] if you [collect] enough power-ups, you [can] use [your] ninja magic [to] summon a giant toad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This will actually eat enemy -- ([well], first of all, [it'll]) *freeze* enemies on the screen; then your Toad [can] eat [them] all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [This is] definitely the coolest magical power [in] the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Also, if] ya catch enough [of the little], uh, floating [objects that] the princess drops on ya, you [will] *occasionally* go [into], like, a *Bonus Round*, where you [can] actually fight the pirate [that] kidnapped [her]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This little minigame sequence, here, reminds me of "[Satan's] Hollow". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [actually not] *required*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [don't] *have* [to do it]; it's purely, [like], an optional [little], uh, minigame that [doesn't] have any [effects] on [the] main game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [After you've defeated] the [pirate and then] you rescue the princess, things [will return to] normal afterwards. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And, just] like in "Ninja-kun...", as you progress the enemies [get] stronger [and] stronger. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The enemies that started off as, like, bosses [will eventually] become the primary enemy in the level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, you have these [little] crazy umbrella demon things. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, when you *kill* someone, like, their actual -- their ghost [will] ap... -- appear [and] you [can get some] *bonus* points by, uh, grabbing the ghost. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [So], I think I [find] this game a little more fun [than] the original "Ninja-kun...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... [It's] hardly *spectacular*, but certainly it -- yeah, [it's] a cute way to kill a [bit] of time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Onyanko Town 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 November 21 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Micronics
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing that's [interesting about] the FamiCom is [we'll often] see a series of games come [out] all [around] the same time [that] have [something] very similar [in] common. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [For example], *"Challenger"* [just] came out [and] here we have, immediately afterwards, another game [that] features full horizontal [and] vertical scrolling. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, this game is even less [interesting] than *"Challenger"*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is "*Onyanko* Town", [released] by Pony Canyon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If [you're *not* familiar] with Pony [Canyon], well... [it's] {a} rather strange name but they are actually a major Japanese *record* label. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Pony] Canyon [has] been around [for] years [but in] the early '80s they decided [to] try [their] hand [at] releasing video games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I [don't] know who actually developed this - [if it] was Pony Canyon or [if] they [used] another company, [such as] Tose. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no other names on the credits. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The lack of original music is one [of] the tip-offs to the low-budget nature [of] this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's simply an arrangement of Mussorgsky's "Ballet [of the] Chicks [in] Their Shells" from "Pictures [at an] Exhibition". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The gameplay idea here is very simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You're a mother cat, [your] *kitten* has wandered away; you've got to roam the town, grab it, [and] bring [it back to your] house. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Along the way, you'll face, uh, dogs wearing overalls. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, ya might think, 'Well, cats are [pretty fast]; they can run, jump, climb over fences. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Y... -- Your character [should] be able {to} move [around with a lot] of *speed*.', but definitely not. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The mother [cat] moves [at] a very deliberate pace. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe she's encumbered by the dress [and] apron she's wearing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, she does have one advantage over *real* cats - namely [the] power to t... -- telekinetically move manhole covers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Pressing the button, [while your] character is facing a *manhole* cover, [will] cause the cover to open up and you [can] trap enemies inside. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [can also] fall [into] the manhole cover yourself. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [also] possible [to] jump over [an] enemy [while you're not] carrying [your kitten in your] arms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once again, this game [is] an original [for] the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [It wasn't] released on any other systems, [as] far [as] *I* know. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And], *overall*, the game is [pretty forgettable]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One thing you might [not] like [about it] is the amazingly slow speed [at] which your character *moves*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The [simplicity of] this game makes me [think that] maybe [it] was actually intended [for] children. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, granted the game is, sort of, cute; it's [probably not] something you'd [actually] want [to] play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The fact [that] it's so very, very slow, rather repetitive, [sort] of boring, and then, of course, you have that 10-second musical theme repeated over [and] over [and] over again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [You'll] probably wanna stay clear [of] this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I [haven't] played this game too extensively, but there *[doesn't]* really seem [to] ever be any variation in the gameplay. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you [get your kitten] back home, you [start] a new level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But I [don't] think [the] levels really change [at] all, other [than] the color. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The enemies [and] the basic gameplay remains the same. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pachicom 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 November 21 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bear's
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toshiba EMI 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [Well], if ya didn't like "Onyanko Town", [you're probably not] gonna [like] this game any more. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is *"Pachicom"* - and, *yes*, this is a Pachinko video game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Pachinko is Japan's national hobby/gambling addiction. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's really not surprising [that] there is [a certain amount] of demand for Pachinko [video] games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this game [will probably not] interest you [at] all (even [for] 10 seconds), but... maybe [you're interested] in how [Pachinko actually] works. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, what it is, is -- is this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [start] off by buying a bunch of [little] silver balls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (In this case, you [start off with] a hundred.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 They go [into] the machine [and] you [shoot] them out, using [a little] knob. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [There's, like -- There's, like], a pressure knob; you [can] see [it] represented here by [that little] blue circle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [You] use the D-Pad [to] control the pressure. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ball bearings [that] fall [into] the [slot at] the bottom [are] lost. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [But] those [that] fall in certain *pockets* [will actually] win you *additional* ball bearings. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object [of] the game is [to] wind up [with] more little ball bearings [than] you [started out] with. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Then* you [can redeem your] extra ball bearings for *prizes* (or, *unofficially*, cash). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is a [lot] less interactive [than] 'Pinball'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [only] thing you [actually control is] the pressure with which the [little] ball bearings [get] shot [out] at. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 From there, [it's really just] a [matter] of luck. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game [lets] you choose [between] a couple [different types] of [Pachinko] machines. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [Now], ya may [have noticed, this] game was [actually released] by Toshiba EMI, *another* major Japanese record company. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I [don't] think they [developed] the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a JPM listed on the [title] screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, I have no idea *who* they are. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They [must] be a small [developer] contracted to actually [design] this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Luckily*, you'll [probably find] the [last] game this [episode to] be a [bit] more interesting [than this]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pac-Land 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 November 21 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 *Alright*! From *Namco*, it's a port of their 1984 *Arcade* classic, *"Pac-Land"*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was [released the] same day [as] "Pachicom" [and] "Onyanko Town", but [this] is a much [more interesting] game! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the *original* Arcade "Pac-Land" was really one of the pioneering horizontal Platform Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *"Pac-Land"* was certainly [not] the *first* horizontal side-scrolling Platformer, but it *was*, perhaps, the [most popular and] the most influential [of] these early games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Certainly, a lot [of] the concepts [in "Super Mario] Bros." originally sprung from *this* game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The [*object* is to get] *Pac-Man* from his house to *[Fairyland*, which is located] on the far right-hand side [of] the world. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [You're actually] escorting a lost fairy [back to Fairyland, but] that's [not really] made clear in this [particular] port. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the *Arcade* version, you [can] see [that] Pac-Man is keeping the fairy under his hat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Along the *way*, you'll have to avoid various *ghosts*, [collect] cherries [for] points, [and] occasionally find a, uh, s... -- [like], a "Pac-Man" *Power Pill*. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is a cool [little] game, [but] you might [find] yourself taking issue [with] the controls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The original *Arcade game* didn't have a joystick; it [only] had *buttons*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This FamiCom port [actually, sort] of, replicates the unusual control scheme. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The [right button] makes ya move right, the left button makes ya move left, [and] to jump, you [hit] the D-Pad... in any direction. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This backwards constro... -- control scheme is [actually] rather counter-intuitive, as you [can] imagine. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] unfortunately, I *think* [that] the graphical *downgrade* [required] by the FamiCom *makes* this game *lose* a [certain amount of its] charm. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The *sprites* [are] a [lot] smaller, [and] this version [doesn't really] have [that] same, sort of, cartoony graphical appeal [that] the original Arcade version had. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, [in] the *Arcade version*, [when] you finally [get] *back* [to your] house, the entire "Pac-Man" family comes [out to greet] you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's missing in this version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Or, [for] example, I mentioned earlier the fairy [that] you keep underneath [your] hat. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We see here a [lot] of the, [sort] of, typical basic platforming [that] marks this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When you [actually get to Fairyland], [ya get] a pair [of] magical *boots* [that allow] you {to}, [sort] of, jump in midair. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This helps you [get back to your] home a [lot] easier, because a [lot] of the, uh, [bridges and whatnot are] now missing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 {It} looks like I fell [right] through the, uh, *[platform]*, there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah! Here [we] are [in] Fairyland, finally. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [And] now we're on the way back home. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So "Pac-Land" is certainly worth playing, [at] least a [little] bit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you've never played the game, it's certainly an [important] game [in] the history of, uh, [Platformers]. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I would definitely recommend *trying* [it, but] really, [it] is [definitely not up to] the same level as the Arcade game, unfortunately. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If nothing else, [it's] worth [playing] to observe the influence this game had on "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇🍌
