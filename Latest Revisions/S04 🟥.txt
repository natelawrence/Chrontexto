👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chronsega Episode 4 ✨


🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Chronsega' is back! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it's a special episode, since it's [Part] 1 of the great R.P.G. Showdown, [pitting] against each other two enormously [popular] 8-bit R.P.G.s, which [just] happened [to] be released a few days apart. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 First up, we have "Miracle Warriors: Seal of the Dark Lord". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, no, not really. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's actually "Phantasy Star". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If there's one single game people remember the Master System for, it's "Phantasy Star". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 [And] of course, there's a [lot] of other [great] games, covering [August] through December of [1987]. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also [important to] note, September and October saw the release [of] the [Master System] in *Europe*, where (along with *Brazil*) the console achieved its [greatest] success. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also, the Mark III was *rereleased* with the FM *sound* chip, under [the name] Master System in *Japan*. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so let's [get] going. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Doki Doki Penguin Land: Uchuu-Daibouken 🇯🇵 // Penguin Land 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 August 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Let's [get started] with the one game from [August 1987] "Doki Doki Penguin Land: Uchuu-Daibouken" (or just "*Penguin* Land" {as} [it] was known outside [of] *Japan*). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese subtitle means '[Great] *Space* Adventure'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ya see, this game is [set] in space. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not [that] you [would notice if] ya miss the [introduction] of your penguin rolling around an egg on the *moon*. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Other than that, the game looks [sort of] like it takes place in some sort of icy dungeon (maybe somewhere in the same general area as Nintendo's "Ice Climber"). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is the first 'Doki Doki Penguin...' game we've seen, but Sega did release an earlier title for the S.G.-1000 (the predecessor to the Master System). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This 1985 game was simply called "Doki Doki Penguin Land" and apparently took place near the North Pole because we see igloos and polar bears. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Yeah, I know penguins live on the South Pole. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But polar bears and penguins are just one of those unstoppable video game combination.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alright then. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But what's this? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Believe it or not, this game was actually released in Arcades the same year. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Does this look exactly like the S.G.-1000 version? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, that's because the Arcade game used special hardware, based on the S.G.-1000. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have to admit, that's [pretty] bad-looking for a 1985 Arcade game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As for the Master System version, it is a port. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Or is it a remake, or a sequel, or who really knows? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I believe that some of the levels were borrowed directly from the first game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, maybe 'enhanced port' might be the description that we're looking for. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The object is to simply get your, uh, egg to the bottom of the level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Along the way, watch out for bears, long drops, landing on the egg, or just, sort of, getting stuck. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Failure to do so will result in the heartbreaking scenario of the egg being destroyed right before Papa Penguin's eyes. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 How very cruel! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Picking at the ice will cause it to crack and the egg will drop down one level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you've reached the bottom, you'll find the, uh, computer room (or something like that). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And baby penguins will carry off the egg. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, there are other little features - like rocks you can drop on the bears or special tubes the eggs can be dropped down. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It's} nothing too exciting, I suppose. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 All in all, it's a fairly typical puzzle Platform Game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We've seen various similar games for the FamiCom. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Penguin Land" just has brighter colors. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, it's not bad for such a simple Arcade-style game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nazca '88: The Golden Road to Paradise 🇯🇵 // Aztec Adventure 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 September 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hey, Sega goes '...Zelda'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's "Nazca '88..." or "Aztec Adventure" as it was known outside of Japan. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This was the [only] game released in September of 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Master System's release schedule for summer of '87 was [pretty] darn sparse. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But it will pick up in October. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though comparing this to "...Zelda" is quite an exaggeration, since "Aztec Adventure" is [pretty] much linear and straightforward. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's not really any of that wacky exploration. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The structure is simple - travel through each level, uh, defeat some bosses, and then move on to the next level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game does superficially resemble "...Zelda", with its non-scrolling screens and maze-like rows of bushes and rocks. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The one thing that does set "Aztec Adventure" apart from many similar games, is the fact that you can, sort of, hire mercenaries. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 When you come across these sword-wielding enemies, you can literally throw money at them. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The bird is the cheapest (requires 1 money bag) and the dog is the most expensive (he takes 4). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you acquire their services, your animal friends will march along next to you and damage any enemies they touch. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They also add more firepower to your projectile weapons. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Enemies will often drop a weapon of some sort. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can see your supply in the upper right hand corner. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 'Now one moment!', you say, 'this Nino fellow - who exactly is he?'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, his outfit makes him look like he comes from the Andes Mountains. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This makes sense, as the Japanese title, "Nazca '88...", sort of, implies it takes place in Peru. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In fact, the famous Nazca lines appear in the final level. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Apparently someone felt the name "Nazca..." was not marketable enough in the U.S., so it was renamed "Aztec Adventure". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess both the Aztecs and the Nazca were pre-Columbian Central / South American cultures, so, I suppose that makes sense. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, I'll admit, the idea of hiring enemies to assist you is cool - and a similar idea was used in "Magic of Scheherazade" (a game that I like quite a bit). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The problem is, "Aztec Adventure" predates the very concept of friendly-unit A.I.. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Your assistants, sort of, form a circle around you, will blindly march into hostile enemies and get stuck on bushes and rocks. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This becomes quite an issue in this particular level - of getting your, uh, friendly units across the river is gonna be [pretty] tough. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game has 10 levels, but the second five are [pretty] much the same as the first five. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, there are things I don't like about this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nino moves painfully slow, his knife has almost no reach, sometimes the ranged weapons don't do damage to enemies, and the mercenaries are so difficult to control sometimes it doesn't even seem like it's actually worth firing. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Aztec Adventure" is not a great game but it does belong to the small group of Master System games that feel like a console title, rather than an Arcade title. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This game would be unremarkable if it were released on the FamiCom, but on the Master System, it really stands out! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, what happens in the end? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, you finally reach the door to paradise. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And what's on the other side? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We never find out! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But the ending sequence tells you that the real paradise lies internally in the person who dreams of it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You see, paradise is all inside us, man! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's [pretty] deep! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Masters Golf 🇯🇵 // Great Golf 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 10 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Did I mention something last episode of 'Chronsega' about Sega's unspectacular 'Great Sports' series finally winding up? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's about time to put that dog to sleep with "Great Golf" (also known as "Masters Golf"). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Jesus, why are there so many Golf Games?). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, you have your usual 8-bit Golf options: up to four players at once, and you can enter your name. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game also makes ya choose your clubs - 14 out of 17 possible clubs. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 'But wait!', you say, 'Wasn't there already a "Great Golf" game for the Master System?'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Why yes, as a matter of fact, there was! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Let's go back in time to the year 1986 (December 1986)! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This game here is the original "Great Golf", as covered back in "Chronsega ... 2". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This first "Great Golf" was released [only] in Japan and, uh, used this rather, sort of, strange three-quarters camera angle (unlike [pretty] much all the other Golf Games of the era). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so we're back to 1987 "Great Golf". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This is a completely different game, named "Masters Golf" for the Japanese release. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S. and Europe, the name "Great Golf" was used, since the first game had never been released in those territories. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The exact same thing happened with "The Pro Yakyuu Pennant Race" being retitled "Great Baseball" in the West, when there was already an earlier "Great Baseball" in Japan. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, let's take a look at the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, this uses a more, uh, standard camera angle, stationed behind the golfer (just like in most of the FamiCom Golf Games). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You know the drill by now; choose your club, choose your direction, there's a Power Meter. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Golf Game, I think, was probably one of the first to be completely standardized. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As is often the case, uh, there is a bit of an art to putting. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For those of you wanting to try the game (and I'm sure that's [pretty] much all of you out there), here's a pro tip: use the other button to check the slope of the green. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I didn't know that when I was make... -- making this video, so I had to use a lot of trial and error when putting. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But when you hit that button (it's actually a nice touch) the guy gets down and eyeballs the slope using his Golf club. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Adds, sort of, a bit of realism to the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Other games often to have like just like little arrows indicating which direction the green is headed. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, I guess I'll insert my usual rant about Golf Games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Namely, there's too many! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Where have they been so far? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like, uh, five on the FamiCom and then two on the Master System? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, I played seven Golf Games so far. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's not that many but they all seem so similar. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As for "Great Golf", well, I mean, there's really nothing wrong with it; it looks nicer the most of the FamiCom Golf Games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You know, {it} plays about the same. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess the courses are, you know, reasonably original looking; they don't all seem exactly the same. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I've complained a lot about the 'Great Sports' series. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And I'm [pretty] sure that "Great Golf" is the last game in this series. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And (at least so far) the Master System has not yet seen any Mahjong Games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fantasy Zone II: Opa Opa no Namida 🇯🇵 // Fantasy Zone II 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 17 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Next up, it's the bizarrely titled "Fantasy Zone II: Opa Opa no Namida" (released in the West as "Fantasy Zone II: The tears of Opa-Opa). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's a rather grim title for such a bright, shiny, happy little game! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess that, despite "Fantasy Zone"'s cheerful appearance, Opa-Opa does reside in a world full of death, destruction, and continuous warfare. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Right. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 These 'Fantasy...' games aren't really at all cheerful, it turns out. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, obviously, this looks a lot like "Fantasy Zone (I)" [only] a bit more colorful and detailed. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it's a very nice-looking game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It plays just like the first game with a few extra [things] they added in. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 All the levels now feature multiple zones interconnected by these warps. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ya need to travel to each area, destroy all the bases and then find the warp to the boss. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the bases now drop folding money rather than big old gold coins. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess "Fantasy Zone"'s economic structure has undergone some changes since the first game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the shops like we saw there just a second ago work about the same. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can get speed ups, better bombs, extra lives and a variety of limited use weapons. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As before, an item gets more expensive each time you purchase it. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The bosses are, sort of, similar to those in "Fantasy Zone (I)". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The first boss you encounter in this game is also a giant log. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Except that here instead of seeds he shoots a whole lot of, uh, flying logs at you. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As expected "Fantasy Zone II..." sends Opa-Opa through a series of weird looking universes, mostly characterized by bright colors and sort of a psychedelic feel. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though from what I understand those sorts of drugs are not nearly as common in Japan as they are in the U.S.. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, presumably the designers were under the influence of nothing more serious than cigarettes and shochu when making this game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Bosses[pretty] much always explode in the shower of wealth upon dying. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nothing wrong with picking up some spare cash while saving the world right? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Fantasy Zone II..." was an SMS original, but it was ported to the Arcades later. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Isn't that a little backwards? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, the Arcade version didn't really receive much of a graphical upgrade. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's virtually identical to the Master System version. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, here we're back to the Master System version again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, if you like "Fantasy Zone (I)", presumably you'll like this as well. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Maybe a little bit harder. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You sorta have to explore your way through world using the warp zones. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing's for sure; this is a darn [pretty] game 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It's} definitely one of the best-looking Master System games we've seen so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Haja no Fuuin 🇯🇵 // Miracle Warriors: Seal of the Dark Lord 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Master System goes R.P.G. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The genre that's slowly taking over the FamiCom finally comes to Sega's console with "Haja no Fuuin". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Jesus, it looks like you play as members of Yes in this game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, the game does contain a typically cool FM chip [enhanced] soundtrack. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And "Haja no Fuuin" has the distinction of being I think, the first console R.P.G. to be released in the United States. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sega released an English version very quickly (uh, way before any NES/R.P.G.s) under the name "Miracle Warriors: Seal of the Dark Lord". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Of course, "Miracle Warriors..." would never leave the big impression like some of the other early R.P.G.s, like "Phantasy Star" or "Dragon Quest", mostly because it's just not very good. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We've actually seen this game before in "Chrontendo Episode 23". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That was the episode with seven or eight R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You might recall the game originally came out for Japanese computers in 1986. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It was imported to the FamiCom by ASCII in October 1987 in a heavily revised edition. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Five days later, Sega's version came out with considerably altered gameplay and brand new graphics. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This version is generally considered to be the best of the many versions of "Haja no Fuuin". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, "Miracle Warriors..." is a typical hardcore early R.P.G. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You start with absolutely no money, weapons or armor. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's not even a town nearby. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You encounter random enemies on the world map. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (I love the fact that one of the very first enemies you encounter is called the Weasley Wimp!.) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Using a "Dragon Quest"-style menu, you take turns attacking each other. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] simple. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This enemy has dropped two fangs (uh, more about that a little later). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, the odds are that you almost immediately run into a much tougher enemy from which you can escape and you end up getting Game Over. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The other versions of this game are actually even worse in this department. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You'll also occasionally find, uh, non-threatening parties on the road such as merchants and travelers and that sorta thing. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And if you survive long enough to reach a village, you'll find the N.P.C.s with the, you know, usual helpful hints. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There will be a weapons and armor shop and a place to heal. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are no Item Shops really, uh, there are healers who do sell herbs. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess it's time to buy a weapon, say a basic knife... except that it costs 3000 guilders. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's right; everything in this game is way overpriced! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, you can sell fangs, uh, that the monsters dropped for cash. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But all in all, "Miracle Warriors..." throws no punches. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In "Dragon Quest", you got a free Magic Refill in the first village, which thus allowed you to, sort of, heal up for free. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here healing is very expensive! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Everything costs a lot of money in this game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And what exactly is the story on the currency? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Guilders? Does this thing take place in Holland? 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, it's gonna take you a very long time to collect enough cash to actually buy the knife, armor, and shield. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Most of the money you make will go right back into healing you. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though, you will occasionally encounter enemies that drop a lot of money (like the evil merchants; you're quite fortunate if you happen to run into a few of those). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But there are actually additional expenses. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 See, your weapons and armor take damage when used. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So you'll need to keep running back to the town and then have the blacksmith repair them. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This will generally cost you several 100 guilders. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 My knife has a, uh, rating there of six which means it's about ready to break. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and when you're in the in town map, there's really no like signs or descriptions or wa... -- any ways to identify what the buildings actually are. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You just have to enter each one and figure out if it's like [a] Item Shop or a Weapon Shop or whatever. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, after quite a lot of grinding, you'll be strong enough to, sort of, venture out into the world and find some clues about your mission (namely tracking down the other three party members) - all the while continuing to collect guilders and fangs. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing you can do is, if you really want cash, you can attack the friendly parties - but [it's] at a cost! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You lose what are called Character Points. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Attacking bad monsters will slowly build Character. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Killing a merchant or a traveler will cost you a lot in Character Points. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And Characters actually need to progress past certain points in the game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Miracle Warriors..." is very different than, uh, most console R.P.G.s (not surprising, since it began life on a computer). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Spells, for example, are not used in combat or to heal, but are [only] useful at certain points to advance the plot. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Like here, for example, when you fight a party member. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are magic items that can be used in combat. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But these are one time use items dropped by monsters or purchased. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And they're usually very rare or expensive. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so here I've gotten my second-party member. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, you might think you're gonna be stronger, but combat works differently than you might think. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Only] one party member can attack per turn. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you can't really gang up on enemies. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And [only] the attacking party member gains experience. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, leveling when you have multiple party members is very slow. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Better weapons can be found in, sort of, out of the way places but tend to be very expensive. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can improve your weapon (a little) but it costs like 60,000 guilders. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Each character has a special weapon that can be found, but these cost fangs. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you don't wanna immediately go out and sell your fangs all the time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to, sort of, hang on to them. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This whole, sort of, double currency is just one of the many irritating things in "Miracle Warriors...". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's not really clear from this dialog here, but I actually just traded 300 Fangs for the Turos' Sword for Guy. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Do I need to mention how badly designed the display is? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The image of your party i... -- on the left is really unnecessary. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It just, sort of, shows what terrain you're on. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the teeny tiny map on the right is almost completely useless. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's very easy-to-get lost, since it doesn't really give you a very good idea of anything other than your immediate surroundings. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Furthermore, "Miracle Warriors..." seems kind of allergic to numbers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There aren't numbers assigned to your Hit Points, experience, level, or damage. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Instead, you just get those bars, which take about 25% of the screen. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Early R.P.G.s really struggled how to present all these information on a video game screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It} really makes you admire "Dragon Quest" with its relatively clean design. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, I got stuck at a certain point (a powerful mini-Boss that instantly slaughtered my party). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 No loss, I suppose, as "Miracle Warriors..." is what the folks on the Internet might call 'unplayable'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Too much grinding to too little effect, very slow, repetitive combat, and very little in terms of items or magic to add variety to the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In other words, it's really not worthy of your time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mahjong Sengoku Jidai 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sanritsu 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, it was [only] a matter of time, I suppose. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sega has finally released a Mahjong Game, "Mahjong Sengoku Jidai" ('Sengoku Jidai' being a period of Warring States in medieval Japan). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In other words, this game is one of fierce Mahjong competition. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 They are, sort of, the, uh, typical options that you encounter. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's both the one-on-one Computer-style Mahjong, as well as 4-Player Mahjong. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Some earlier Mahjong Games give you [only] one such option. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You don't normally associate Sega with Mahjong Games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it turns out this is not developed by Sega, but rather by Sanritsu. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (I believe this is Sanritsu's first Master System game.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, Sanritsu had put out this Arcade Mahjong-style game with a very similar title, "Mahjong Kyou Jidai", which is one of those adult-style Mahjong Games with sexy girls in it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Master System game isn't quite a port of this title. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But perhaps Sanritsu was called in to work on this, uh, due to their recent experience with the genre. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, who were Sanritsu? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, they were an electronics company that got into game development in the early 1980s. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They hooked up with Sega [pretty] quickly, becoming sort of a second-party developer for Sega. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, the Sanritsu development team transformed into SIMS, which was eventually absorbed into Sega, but has since become an independent entity once again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sanritsu and SIMS ported tons of games to various Sega platforms, and we'll be seeing their name quite a bit in 'Chronsega'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As for Mahjong Games, well, unlike the FamiCom, the Master System never became a Mahjong-heavy platform. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If I'm not mistaken, this may have been the [only] one. 🍇🍌

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega | Sanritsu 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, let's move on to an Arcade port (the first of a few this episode). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is "Alien Syndrome". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess you might call it a Run-'n'-Gun with 2-Player Co-Op as an option. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you might have guessed from the cover art "Alien Syndrome" clearly borrows from the, uh, 20th Century Fox Movies. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Remember that "Aliens" (the second one) had just come out in 1986. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Both the U.S. and the Japanese box art depict a creature whi... -- which looks [pretty] much exactly like the one found in "Alien" and "Aliens". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, as we've noticed, uh, Sega has been porting Master System titles from very recent Arcade games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Alien Syndrome" was no exception; the Arcade version was released in 1987 as well. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The gameplay is simple. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Run around blasting aliens and rescuing your fellow humans (who are scattered about the base). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade game might be considered a minor classic. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 After all, killing aliens with a flame thrower is [pretty] fun. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, the Master System port isn't nearly as successful, for a number of reasons. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game has been changed quite a bit. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Rather than the smooth overhead scrolling of the original, we now have, like, this, uh, flip screen effect, giving a, sort of, slight, uh, "...Zelda" feel. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Also, enemies materialize a couple seconds after you enter the room. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I suppose this is good; it means you can't immediately run into one upon entering a room. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But one problem {that} does arises often don't materialize like right next to you (or [pretty] much on top of you). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 When this does happen, you need to move out of the way [pretty] quickly or else you'll lose a life. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, you start out criminally underpowered, but you can find lasers, flame throwers, etc. throughout the base. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's those little, uh, letters that you see scattered about in the walls there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you found all the humans (and there's actually a very helpful status screen to tell you how many more you need to find), ya then hustle back to the exit and face a boss. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the original used the Sega System 16A board (which is also used for "SDI", "Shinobi", "Fantasy Zone"). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, while the Master System obviously doesn't have the power of the 16A, the home version is [pretty] lame-looking! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean really, this looks like a more colorful FamiCom game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And part of the issue I have with this is that everything (the graphics, the sound, the layout, the general, sort of, fill of the gameplay) has been changed to such an extent that the Master System "Alien Syndrome" doesn't really feel like the same game! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Incidentally, this was ported by Sanritsu, which may be at least, a partial explanation. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Ah. I've cleared the first round here and I move on to the rather phallic-looking 'Clio' spaceship.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You know, a lot of the Master System ports have been [pretty], uh, hit or miss, so far. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 We've seen some great versions of "Fantasy Zone" and "Wonder Boy", and then... unimpressive titles like "Enduro Racer" and this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I wish Sega would be a bit more consistent when porting their arcade favorites. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 SDI 🇯🇵 // Global Defense 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 24 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Moving right along, it's the last game of October, "SDI" (or "Global Defense", as it was called in West). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 New York destroyed by atomic bombs. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {It} looks like a Roland Emmerich movie. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Wikipedia describes this intro as, quote unquote "notorious". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, for the young folks out there, the Strategic Defense Initiative was a far-fetched plan to build a missile system that would shoot down ICBMs from outer space. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The idea was supported by Ronald Reagan and critics at the time referred to the plan as 'Star Wars'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, it never really got beyond the planning stages. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Strategic Defense Initiative (or SDI, for short) was quite a hot topic of discussion back in the 1980s. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "SDI" was originally an Arcade game - one we just saw in "Chrontendo Episode 23"'s "1987 Arcade Round-Up". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This game used a trackball controller and, sort of, resembled a heavily-updated version of Atari's "Missile Command". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Master System game just uses a standard controller. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the first section (the offensive half) you attempt to shoot any passing missiles, spaceships, etc, while avoiding enemies and projectiles. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The control scheme is odd. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The D-Pad moves the reticle around and you use one button to fire. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 However in order to move your ship, you need to hold down the other button while using the D-Pad. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It is a little awkward. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, if you've survived this segment, uh, the space shuttle will actually give you a lift to the second stage (which is known as the defensive half). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here, all the remaining enemy missiles are approaching Earth, and you need to shoot them as they pass by. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You know what this game really reminds me of? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... "Missile Defense 3-D" which we covered last episode. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really sure when "Missile Defense 3-D" was released - possibly after this one. (Who knows?). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, someone in Sega must have really had a fixation with missile defense systems and nuclear devastation. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Either way, there is a valuable lesson here, I suppose. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If Earth is being attacked by aliens, we'll definitely need more than one missile defense ship. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just like the old "Missile Command" game, if too many missiles hit Earth, you will then get a Game Over. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The nuclear apocalypse is depicted as, sort of, a flashing screen. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That was a common video game shorthand for 'huge explosion', back in the day. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, if you are successful in defending Earth, then those same two stages will just repeat themselves over and over again. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 {There's} nothing really wrong with "SDI"; it's just, sort of, a minor game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Bank Panic 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 [?] [?] 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sanritsu | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 We need to clean up a few non-Japanese titles before moving on. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Let's start with "Bank Panic" - A Europe-[only] title, which shows a copyright of 1987, so it was presumably released the second half of that year. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Master System was released in Europe in September. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Bank Panic" is a port of the 1984 Arcade game developed by Sanritsu and published by Sega. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In this game, you're acting as, sort of, a security guard in the bank - shooting any bank robbers that appear (while not shooting any customers). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can see three doors at a time and you have three separate fire buttons corresponding to each of the on screen doors. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Bank Panic" was a nice little game, though, I suppose it was a little violent. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Whenever you shot a bandit, you'll see a little geyser of blood kind of squirt out, as he fell back. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As was typical, uh, "Bank Panic" was ported to various Computer systems. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, Sega themselves actually released a version in 1985 on the S.G.-1000. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This version was obviously a little ugly, but it was a reasonable facsimile of the original. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The fact that the S.G.-1000 did not have three buttons meant you had to use Up or Down on the Control Pad, in order to shoot at the left door. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Buttons one and two allow ya to shoot at the middle and right doors, respectively. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For the Master System version, the same control scheme was used. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Apparently banking has changed a lot since the days of the Wild West. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 For example, rather than filling out a deposit slip, you can simply open a door, say hi, and throw your money inside the bank, and leave. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Banks also had circular floor [plans] and a lot of doors. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This would be bad for security purposes, I suppose. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Fortunately bandits won't shoot you in the back. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Rather, they'll wait behind the door until you're facing that particular door, then open it, then shoot at you. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 At the very top of the screen there, you can see if anyone is behind the door or approaching the door by looking at the red bars behind each door number. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Doors will open automatically when you're facing a door [with] someone behind it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If it's a bandit, shoot but not too quickly because that's considered to be unfair. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, once deposits have been made at all the doors you will then move on to the next level. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's various other factors as well. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ticking bombs or sometimes appear on door. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Shooting the bomb will somehow render it harmless. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Bandits will often be standing behind kidnapped customers. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And you can get a bonus by shooting hats off a kid's head. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Each new level is exactly the same [only] with a slightly higher difficulty. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This being an old sort of fashion Arcade game, points figure [pretty] heavily into the game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can lose a life, either by getting shot by a bandit or by accidentally shooting a customer. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Naturally when ya hit a female customer, you get a rather gratuitous view up her skirt (typical for a Japanese game, I suppose). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, all in all, "Bank Panic" is a fun little game, a bit of a trifle Gameplay-wise but it's still a [pretty] well handled port. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ghostbusters 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 [?] [?] 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Activision | Compile 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well here's another non-Japanese release - one which came out in some time in 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Ghostbusters", one of the many versions of David Crane's [Computer] game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] much all the versions beat are very similar opening. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But here what's that little thing bouncing up and down? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It looks like a "Puyo Puyo" blob! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yep, the Master System "Ghostbusters" was ported by Compile - those reliable guns for hire. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The original release was, of course, the 1984 Commodore 64 game from Activision. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Master System version sticks [pretty] closely to this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously the Commodore 64 game is [pretty] ugly looking. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And there actually are some differences in some of the mechanics (like the, uh, driving sequences are very different). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing that the Commodore version does have is there are actually a few voice samples. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "He slimed me!". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, we saw the FamiCom port, uh, back in "Chrontendo ... 10". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Those of you who saw that episode know that I hated the FamiCom "Ghostbusters". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sega's game is -- is -- it's a little better. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As expected, the Master System "Ghostbusters" gives you very [pretty] graphics! 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 You start out choosing your vehicle and your items, which range from 'absolutely necessary' to 'utterly worthless'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you collect cash, you can buy more items or upgrades, but it's not really necessary. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I played the game without getting the upgrades. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, when you see the flashing building, move your Ghostbuster icon to that building. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You'll have a rather, uh, boring little driving sequence. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you cross the path of any ghost on the world map you can try to suck 'em up while driving. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Then you set down your Ghost Trap and use your Proton Beams to herd the ghost above the trap and then activate it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you managed to get all the ghosts in the trap, great! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If any escape you will be slimed and one of your ghost busters will be out of commission. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You will then need to drive to the Ghostbuster headquarters and into the traps and revive any slime characters. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One irritating thing not found in the FamiCom game is Mr. Stay-Puft. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You need to have $1,000 when the city's PK energy gets full; otherwise the game simply ends. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sounds easy but in the Master System version occasionally Ghost will combine to form Mr. Stay-Puft who will then destroy a building. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Apparently the city will fine you $4,000 if this happens, which can drain your cash [pretty] quickly. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, once the PK energy is full, you then have to move on to the next part in which you simply have to avoid Mr. Stay-Puft here and enter the building's doorway. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You need to get two out of three "Ghostbusters" in. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, the march of the stairs was the absolute worst part in the FamiCom game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Definitely one of the most shockingly bad videogame moments we've seen so far. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Thankfully, this version is much less annoying. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You control your characters normally (though you do have to avoid the, uh, dishes that the ghost throws at you). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have free chances and if you get hit, you'll start, once again, at very beginning. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The final part simply has you zapping Gozer until he dies. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Gozer shoots out these rather difficult to avoid lightning bolts so it's best to stick to the sides to avoid getting hit. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The primary complaint that I have a... -- of "Ghostbusters" is there's not really a cohesive game, but rather several simple minigames kind of strung together. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They range from pointless like the driving sequences to aggravating like fighting Gozer. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But none are really interesting by themselves. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Master System "Ghostbusters" is better than the FamiCom release, but that means it's [only] uninteresting instead of just awful. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Ghostbusters" doesn't feature much in a way of like an introductory sequence or an ending. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Basically just get this little text scroll here, which is I guess, sort of, typical kind of, you know, lower quality games of the 1980s. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Zaxxon 3D 🇯🇵 // Zaxxon 3-D 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November 07 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ah, "Zaxxon". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But wait! This is "Zaxxon 3D"? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Do you remember those fancy electronic 3D Glasses Sega put out? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They were used in "Missile Defense 3-D". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hardly any games were, uh, made for them but here's the second to do so; it's "Zaxxon 3D". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But before we go any further, do all you whippersnappers out there know "Zaxxon"? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This 1982 Arcade classic was one of the first games to put Sega on the map. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Even back then Sega was making some attempts that's, sort of, a 3D game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Zaxxon" used isometric perspective. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I believe this was the first Sega game to do so. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... That and the detailed scrolling servers of the space fortress set "Zaxxon" apart from the typical Shooters of the era. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Five years later, Sega tries to revive his axe and franchise with this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One helpful tip: there is a hidden option menu that lets you play the game in standard 2D, if you don't have the glasses. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (That's what we're doing here.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you might notice, it's really hard to hit anything in this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's because you have to be lined up vertically with the enemy ship, in order for your laser to hit it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But you can't really tell where you are in relationship to the other ships. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sega tries to fix this by having a little gunsight appear in front of you when you're correctly lined up. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But really, this shouldn't be necessary. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sega was able to pull off a very similar style of gameplay in "Space Harrier". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And Konami's "Falsion" was very similar to "Zaxxon 3D" but much easier to play. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, "Zaxxon 3D" is a [pretty] unattractive game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Quite frankly, the original "Zaxxon" looked better than this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I hope the 3D version plays a lot better in 3D, because this is seriously wretched. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm gonna have to put this down as about the worst game we've seen for the Master System so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 BMX Trial - Alex Kidd 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ah, yes, Alex Kidd - Sega's mascot before they come up with that little blue rodent (whatever his name was). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alex was very much a man dedicated to action and danger running, jumping, pounding everyone into submission with his mighty fists. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Whether he was saving his kingdom or just looking for a video arcade. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alex would let nothing stop him. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, naturally, when Sega decide to produce a new Alex Kidd game, they continued this fine tradition by placing him in a bicycle Racing Game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Jesus! Looks like Alex is running a tricycle or something. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In case you're wondering, no, this was not released outside of Japan. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And for those of you in the West, are you missing anything? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As far as I can tell, no. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Woody Pop", "...Alex Kidd" "BMX Trial..." makes use of a special dial controller and can't be played without it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But the opinion of those who have played it seems to be that the game is sort of nothing special. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, honestly, what were, uh, Sega thinking? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Presumably they had seen all of those Nintendo Sports Games in, uh -- where Mario appears. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, this didn't really work that well, and hopefully they learn their lesson. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm sure in the future, Sega will never dilute the value of their mascots by placing them in silly spin-off games that no one likes. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 After Burner 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 12 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alright! December! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Whereas the FamiCom had about 33 or so games in December. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The Master System has 5 - but one of those games is very good! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (And no, this is not that game.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 This is a port of "After Burner" - Sega's very recent Arcade game, and the latest in their series of 3D Super Scaler games (just like "Space Harrier", "Enduro Racer", and so on). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "After Burner" features insane, fast, sprite-based 3D Action. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, note how the, uh, "SCORE" graphic, in the upper left-hand corner there, looks just like the logo from the movie "Top Gun". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 We saw a bit of "After Burner II" just recently in 'Chrontendo', uh, the "1987 Arcade Round-Up" but this, uh, is "After Burner (I)". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "After Burner II" wasn't a real sequel, just a somewhat revised version of the first game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And of course, we have the standard awesome music, huge explosions, great sound effects - really, [pretty] much everything you could want in a Sega game, back in 1987. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Man! this is one nice-looking game! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} not sure how it was even possible to fit that many, uh, darn sprites on the screen at once, but I guess the, uh, hardware is capable. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, now let's take a look at the Master System version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, at least they got the, uh, speech sample in there. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, the Master System "After Burner" is not quite the visceral experience that the Arcade game is. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Not that Sega didn't try it looks [pretty] good for an 8-bit port of a state-of-the-art Arcade game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it's not the ugly mess the port of "Space Harrier" was. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But everything's been toned down to such an extent it doesn't even really feel like the same game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One important fact: this is a huge game! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The cartridge was 4 Megabits (the largest game released on a cartridge so far). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The biggest FamiCom game at this point was [only] 2 Meg's. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Undoubtedly a lot of work went into this. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it's not, uh, really that bad, but it's a shame the game isn't better. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Your plane suffers from what I guess I would call the "Slalom" syndrome (after Rare's game). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The controls are not finely tuned. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Hitting the pad will cause the plane to turn like at a 45 degree angle, so you don't have like a smooth range of motion. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Hitting the enemy craft with your guns is almost impossible, and the backgrounds are [pretty] empty and barren looking. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the port sorta removes [pretty] much everything that's awesome about the Arcade game and leaves us with this, sort of, the bare skeleton of "After Burner". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Though, I suppose that when you collide with another jet the explosion is [pretty] cool looking. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Honestly, this raises an issue, releasing decent ports of their Arcade games is rapidly becoming a non-option for Sega. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, what's the future of the Master System? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Is Sega gonna focus more on better console-style games? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Or maybe they might just scrap the whole system and come out with a more powerful console. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess we'll see eventually. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tri Formation 🇯🇵 // Zillion II: The Tri Formation 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 13 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sega sure doesn't beat around the bush when it comes to sequels on the Master System. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Seven months after the first game, we have "Zillion II: The Tri Formation" or just "Tri Formation" as the screen says here. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 See, there is the difference between 'Chrontendo' and 'Chronsega'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 With the 'Chronsega' we can play a game one episode and then the sequel on the very next episode. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Zillion" was a long, ambitious, "Metroid"-like game, based on an animated series, uh, co-created by Sega. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I didn't really like the first "Zillion" game; I thought it was too repetitive, but admired Sega for trying to make a, sort of, like a big ambitious game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Zillion II..." is a completely different matter. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's supposedly still based on the same anime, but it doesn't really go out of its way to do anything with the source material. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's no introductions or cutscenes or dialogue that I know of. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As for the gameplay, well, as you can see, it's now a straightforward, uh, Drive-'n'-Shoot sort of game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As much as I dislike "Zillion", I mean, "Zillion II..." is much worse! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This ranks with "Alex Kidd in High Tech World" for rea... s... -- really baffling sequels. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] much everything from the first game has been scuttled. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Zillion II..." has several straightforward levels with the occasional boss or boss-like encounter at the end. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 On the first level, you're on your bike jumping and shooting though you can also transform to a flying suit called the armor Raider. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This makes the vehicle segments a bit easier. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Basically to shoot enemies as they appear while jumping over, uh, the occasional pit or enemy bullet. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You have a life bar which is good as it's [pretty] easy to take damage. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Can be tricky after playing Nintendo games to switch to the Master System with the traverse, uh, shoot and jump buttons. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Especially on those forced-scrolling sections can be really easy-to-get the buttons confused. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game alternates between the vehicle levels and the foot levels (uh, four of each). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One thing should be pointed out: "Zillion II..." is a terrible, annoying, boring game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's, sort of, like "Transformers: Convoy no Nazo". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you're moving forward, enemies while appearing on the far edges of the screen and they fire the second they come into view. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As a result, the best way to avoid to take so much damage is simply to move forward slowly while constantly firing. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Those hoping for a decent "Zillion" sequel that would fix some of the issues in the first game, well, this really, sort of, boggles the mind. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Along with "Zaxxon 3D", I'd say it's one of the worst games for the system. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Phantasy Star 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


👓🏮🍊Warning!   Spoilers Ahoooyyy!

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Out of all the titles released for the Master System, there's one that stands above the rest, almost universally regarded as the best Master System's game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I'm referring, of course, to "Phantasy Star." 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Before we go any further, let's check out these music samples. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... First of all, we'll listen to the U.S. version. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And this is the Japanese version with the FM sound chip. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As you can hear, we got seriously screwed in the music department. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 For this reason we're playing a retranslation of the Japanese release done by 'SMS Power'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 As a very early attempt at localizing an R.P.G., "Phantasy Star" had dialogue changed or removed, names altered, and so on. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, the 'SMS Power' translation is very much superior to the original U.S. version. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Phantasy Star" has your typical R.P.G. plot. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alisa's brother is killed after opposing LaShiec the evil tyrant to the land. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Alisa vows to defeat LaShiec. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Though was it really a good idea for them to have this conversation in the middle of the street with Imperial soldiers standing right there?). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, hey, let's, uh, quickly discuss the game's title. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I, sort of, read on the Internet that some people are a bit confused about the spelling of 'Phantasy', thinking it's some kind of, like, weird, uh, Japanese translation error, or something like that, but that's not really the case. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... In fact, the, uh, 'ph' spelling was quite common before the early 20th century. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The word 'phantasy' comes from the Greek 'phantasia' and there are still words which builder -- bared, uh, traces of the older spelling like 'phantasm' or 'phantasmagoria'. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The 'ph' spelling is intended to give it, sort of, like, an archaic feel because this is, you know, a Fantasy game. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, the now standard R.P.G. elements are all here - Level, Experience, various Stats, Item, Magic, the Village, the Shops. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 All this looks, well, just like "Dragon Quest". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You walk around talking to N.P.C.s who give you the hints and clues as to what to do first. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, there is a space port nearby but you can't access it without a pass. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can however travel to the next city. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Phantasy Star" is unusual, and then it gives you three cities very close by, to which you can access from the very start of the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you check out the shops in the city, you will find some [pretty] good armors and weapons but you really can't afford them yet. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you venture out beyond the walls protecting the city you'll encounter the random enemies. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The flies in this game are, sort of, like the equivalent to "Dragon Quest" slimes. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Combat is very much like in "Dragon Quest" turn base. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can use items, magic or physical attack. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Monsters drop a chest with money inside. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Though really how could a fly carry around a big chest like that?). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, if ya stray more than a few yards outside the gate, you will encounter some way too powerful enemies. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As a rule, the strength of the random monsters can increase dramatically without warning in "Phantasy Star". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In the beginning you'll need to fight a battle or two and quickly head back to the first town to heal. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And then repeat until you've gained a couple levels and can buy some actual equipment. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 One area where "Phantasy Star" and "Dragon Quest" part company is the dungeons. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest" use top-down dungeon but "Phantasy Star" goes for the old-school U.S.-style first-person dungeons. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But, man! The dungeons are where the graphical power of the Master System really shines. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Deep Dungeon" or "Megami Tensei", moving around in the dungeon looks very smooth. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The walls look solid, uh, the lighting is good, there's both ceilings and floors, and everything's, sort of, faded into the distance in the background. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Lots of FamiCom games have tried unsuccessfully to create convincing first-person dungeons but "Phantasy Star" is the first 8-bit game to do so. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, your next goal is to [sorta] track down your other companions. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Clues point you towards another, uh, planet. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But you'll need to search around for the road pass which is an expensive hidden item sold in this one particular shop. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Once you've obtained that you can get past those pesky guard and make your way to the spaceport and eventually hop onto the spaceship. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are three planets in the Solar System and they function, sorta, like the continents in "Dragon Quest II". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, we'll be able to access the entire game world right away. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And eventually you'll need to get your own spaceship - so you can access the last planet. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You don't really control the spaceship; it simply shovels you back and forth between the different, uh, few different cities. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, it's almost kind of like a warp portal - more than like, uh, the boat in "Dragon Quest II" which you can actually steer around. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, among "Phantasy Star"'s strength is this great art style. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The character portraits are beautiful and the, uh, dialogue between the characters are reasonably naturalistic. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's not, you know, "...Legend of Zelda" speak. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 By 1987, characters and video games become much more talkative especially R.P.G.s. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You get big walls of text in these games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, in this game characterization is [pretty] limited. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Virtually the [only] time your characters speak are like here when a new party member is introduced. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 After this, everyone is [pretty] much never heard from again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This, uh, strange silence from your characters releases some odd moments. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, here for example, I found Tyrone. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 He's the -- the second-party member he's, sort of, a typical, uh, tough guy with a flat top. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But oddly enough his, uh, Hit Points and strength are actually less than Myau, the talking cat. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now I mentioned how the lack of dialogue has some strange moments. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Here for example, you have this rather shocking and horrifying occurrence. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yet no one has any reaction whatsoever to Myau being killed. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And it really has no consequences at all. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Obviously this is not exactly you don't fail "Final Fantasy VII" when someone gets killed. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Much like "Dragon Quest (I)", the final dungeon is, uh, quite close to the starting point. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And you can go there first thing but you have no way of opening this damn door until you get Lutz and then Level Up quite a lot. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Phantasy Star" takes a page from "Ultima III" (and, I suppose also, uh, "Hoshi wo Miru Hito") by having four characters, not just three. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Other than the great graphics there's a lot of things to like about this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It demonstrates an almost satirical sense of humor at times, such as this fellow selling cakes from inside a dungeon. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The goal of many of the dungeons is simply a quest item or merely helpful item. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Here the cake is required to visit the governor who provides you with a letter with which to convince Lutz to join your party. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 In a nice touch, we have here what might be the first fake battle in which you automatically lose in the Japanese R.P.G.. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This nightmare appears and slaughters your party. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But it turns out it was all just a dream, (or was it?). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's quite a bit of variety in the overworld. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Some villages are high tech others are rundown and rural. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Aside from the main planet, there's a desert planet and the ice planet. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are patches of bubbling lava, beaches, forest - each with their own, sort of, battle screen background. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the monsters are all animated sometimes even, sort of, very amusing ways. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 That's the different, uh, scenes make quite a bit more of an impression than "Dragon Quest", static monsters and backdrops. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Other than a spaceship that you eventually find, you'll need to get something called the flow mover (which is actually called the hovercraft in the U.S. version), which allows you to travel over water and lava. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Later you'll need to get a vehicle that can smash through blocks of ice. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And of course, you'll constantly be buying better armor and weapons. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Ah! here I'm hopping into the flow mover here. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You need this to access places like that island. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Much like "Ultima III" and "Dragon Quest", not all equipment can be used by all characters. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Myau require special equipment and Lutz, the magic user, (much like the Princess in "Dragon Quest II") need robes and wands and such. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Rather a cool moment: Lutz has a one-on-one magic battle with a master magician (who naturally lives in the bottom of the dungeon). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Lutz, by the way, is one of the, sort of, typical magic users - virtually useless at first but once Leveled Up, uh, with good armor and more Magic Points, he becomes much more useful. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, uh, spells consume enough points that you will have often to find yourself for reserving them for boss battles. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And of course, one great thing about the game is all the monsters. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 All these huge colorful, animated and almost always super cool monsters. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Much of the game's appeal is due to Rieko Kodama's design and characters. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Phantasy Star" demonstrates there was some major talent at Sega working on console games. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Phantasy Star" was conceived by Kotaro Hayashida, who would also work on 'Alex Kidd' and, uh, "Zillion". 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The game was programmed by Yuji Naka who later went on to games like "Sonic the Hedgehog". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Still, "Phantasy Star" is very much a product of its time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 One of the weaknesses is the combat. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Dragon Quest", you can [only] face one kinda enemy at a time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 You can't select which enemy you want to attack and your characters will simply choose a random enemy. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This means you often find yourself, sort of, whittling down the group of enemies help rather than actually concentrating on taking them out one at a time. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 The combat is very simple, it's mostly a matter of hitting the attack button over and over again. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Magic is [pretty] limited. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Lutz has, uh, some spells (fire, wind, and lightning) but they consume too many points to use all the time. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And they're also a few very basic support skills. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Despite the elemental properties of Lutz's magic, enemies don't really seem to have any specific weaknesses. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's [only] one status ailment, a party member can become temporarily bound up and can't move. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 The items don't really factor much in the battle. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 In other words, despite the four character party combat seems, sort of, halfway between "Dragon Quest (I)" and "Dragon Quest II". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, while the 3D dungeons look great, they can become repetitive. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Every dungeon looks the same; [only] the colors change. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Oh, here I'm finally going in into that, uh, one prison I couldn't get into earlier.) 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Throughout the game they travel through caves, warehouses, dungeons, towers, and a morgue - all of which look identical on the inside. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, this lack of variety in dungeons, uh, makes them become, sort of, a bit of a drag, especially because there's just so darn many dungeons in this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 This right here, it was actually a prison, but it looks kind of like every other dungeon in the game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Towards the end of the game, I was actually finding out I was, sort of, getting a little sick of fighting through dungeons. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 "Phantasy Star" starts out very strong as you cross the galaxy looking for companions. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But the last third or so of the game simply becomes a matter of slogging through one identical dungeon after another looking for some special item which is required to get to the bosses layer (such as the arrow prism or these magical berries). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 There's no in game map so ya ...eed -- need to actually either draw [out] the dungeons on paper (or look up maps on the Internet, I suppose). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Furthermore, there's not really much point in fighting enemies after a while. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 But once you reach around level 24 or so, you will start taking, uh, about 5000 plus Experience Points to reach the next level. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And the toughest regular enemies dropped around maybe 25 to 30 points at most. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So I figure there is no point to actually try and kill enemies during the last couple dungeons. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Healing items are [pretty] much worthless and magic is virtually required to damage the final bosses. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, you can't afford to lose much health during these final few dungeons. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, after one very long dungeon (eight floors with about 25 different flights of stairs) you will feed me out the berries and f... -- f... -- fly to the bosses layer. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... And find a normal looking town (sort of, like in, uh, "Dragon Quest II") but there's actually a, uh, special gold dragon boss you'll encounter first. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 (Uh... Here is Myau was transformed into a, uh, flying cat.) 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, once ya [actually get past] this dragon and ya get there there's another lengthy dungeon (uh, though this one's actually a mere five floors). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Then [ya end up beating] the final boss himself. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 And unfortunately there's really no place here [to], like, [replenish] your Magic for your health or anything. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So like I was saying, basically, it's, uh, the last [few] dungeons are more of a matter of, like, enemy avoidance than anything else. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so here is LaShiec. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Um... He asks you a question, but, uh, don't worry, the game won't end if ya choose the wrong answer (like in the first "Dragon Quest" game). 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, despite the game stressing the importance of the laconian weapons (they had to, sort of, trick all over the galaxy to find), they are [pretty] much useless against this guy. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 They almost usually always miss, so Alisa should actually use her fire spell and, uh, Lutz's spells be doing most of the damage. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, the best weapon in the game is the laser gun. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 After defeating this guy, well, the game is actually not over. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Nope, it tells you you have to go and speak to the governor. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, we're doomed to trek all the way back to the desert planet, enter his palace, and find (you guessed it!) another dungeon. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 There are about 25 dungeons in this game. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And while they look great, I mean eventually I think you will, sort of, get tired of drawing all those damn maps. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, if LaShiec seemed a little bit, sort of, uneventful and anticlimactic, because there is of course, one final boss: Dark Force. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Yep, there's the whole, uh, 'one more boss' thing at the very end, which is sorta becoming, sort of, like standard practice in R.P.G. at this point. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, "Phantasy Star" is a great game; people love it. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And with it, Sega proved they could create a title that would rival almost anything on Nintendo system. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Now, there was a price. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The "Phantasy Star" 4 Megabit cartridge retailed for $69.99, that's about $125 in today's money. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Was it worth it? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well, I don't know. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, here's Dark Force. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 What's the strategy for defeating him? 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Well just, sort of, hit him with everything you got until you run out of magic. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, there's really no, sort of, strategy required for any battles in "Phantasy Star". 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 After this, you get a [pretty] decent little ending sequence. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And then, uh, "Phantasy Star" is one of the first games to have, sort of, actually like really kind of cool decent-looking credits. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's not just like the difficult, you know, name, list of names scrolling up the screen. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 So, there we have "Phantasy Star"! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 I guess we have a rundown on the good points: will great graphics, really fantastic soundtrack, very awesome looking monsters, uh, the detailed character and N.P.C. portraits make them feel, sort of, like more like real characters as opposed just videogame sprites. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 On the negative side, there's combat that was a little simple (even by 1987 standards). 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 And there's really not a whole lot of variety in the gameplay. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's sort of 'walk around, find a dungeon, fight your way through the dungeon, grab the item, get out, then go on to the next dungeon'. 🍇🍌


🟥🍪🍊🍓 Some people call this the best 8-bit R.P.G. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 It's certainly the best-looking 8-bit R.P.G.! 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 Whether it plays that great, well, I guess it's, sort of, a matter of personal opinion. 🍇

🟥🍪🍊🍓 If you're any s... -- sort of fan of early R.P.G.s, this is one game that you definitely must play. 🍇🍌
