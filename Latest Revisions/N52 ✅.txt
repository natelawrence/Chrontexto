👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 52 ✨


☕🍊🍓 Hello, everyone, 🍋 Dr. Sparkle here 🍊 and welcome to a 🍋 very spooktacular 🍊 special Halloween 🍋 Episode of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

☕🍊🍓 And this episode 🍋 is very very late, 🍊 and once again I'm sorry, 🍋 yeah, I know. 🍇

☕🍊🍓 So, here we are, 🍋 grinding our way through, 🍊 and the incredibly hectic 🍋 December 1989 release schedule, 🍊 where frickin' 10 games are coming 🍋 out, like, every single week - 🍊 though, once we hit Christmas, 🍊 then we'll be back to around 🍋 two games per week, for a while. 🍇🍌


☕🍊🍓 And by 1990, of course, we'll 🍋 have hit, you know, peak FamiCom. 🍇

☕🍊🍓 Then the number of games will 🍋 actually start decreasing. 🍇🍌


☕🍊🍓 Until then, though, we've 🍋 got a lot of games. 🍇

☕🍊🍓 Right now: 🍊 15 Japanese games released between 🍋 December 1st and December 15th. 🍇🍌


☕🍊🍓 The highlight of this episode 🍋 is almost certainly going to be 🍊 a rather unusual title from Capcom. 🍇

☕🍊🍓 But we also have [an] R.P.G., 🍋 a Baseball Game, a Shoot-'em-Up, 🍊 a Puzzle Game (mostly known in the 🍋 U.S. for its Game Boy version), 🍊 and a few [pretty] oddball titles. 🍇


☕🍊🍓 So let's begin at 🍋 December 1st, 1989. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Meimon! Takonishi Ouendan 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 01 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Graphic Research
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Asmik 🇯🇵 🍌


☕🍊🍓 We are still stuck on 🍋 December 1st, 1989. 🍇

☕🍊🍓 Well, actually, 🍋 there's [only] one more game 🍊 before moving on to December 8th. 🍇

☕🍊🍓 So if you guys liked 🍋 "Vegas Connection" last episode, 🍊 then you'll love this one 🍋 from the same developer, 🍊 Graphic Research. 🍇🍌


☕🍊🍓 "Meimon! Takonishi Ouendan" 🍊 is a game that is sort of in the 🍋 form of a Military Strategy game. 🍇

🐶🍊🍓 Though, rather than armies or 🍋 whatever, we have a ouendan - 🍊 those cheerleading squads that 🍋 chant and pound on drums during games. 🍇

🐶🍊🍓 We are familiar 🍋 with them, of course, 🍊 from the soundtrack of every 🍋 single FamiCom Baseball Game 🍊 we've seen so far. 🍇🍌


☕🍊🍓 Also the original Japanese version 🍋 of "Elite Beat Agents" 🍊 was based around ouendan. 🍇🍌


☕🍊🍓 So, boy! 🍇

☕🍋🍓 How do we explain this one? 🍇

🌋🍊🍓 So, your male cheerleader squad 🍊 is engaged in a street war 🍋 of some sort with cheer squads 🍊 from other schools, I guess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know if this is 🍋 a real thing in Japan, 🍊 but you've got to conquer 🍋 the city, block by block. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have six guys and 🍋 [face] innumerable enemies, 🍊 all of whom are individually 🍋 weaker than you by quite a bit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each side takes turns moving. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When, uh, two opposing units 🍋 occupy the same square, 🍊 a battle begins. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You can Punch or Kick. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Those are the first 🍋 two options here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And less useful (at least at 🍋 first) are the Defense moves 🍊 (the ones below that) where you 🍋 can attempt to Block and Attack. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now the weird thing is this: 🍋 you see that fist coming at you? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As it gets closer, 🍊 it appears to increase the odds of 🍋 the enemy's attack being successful, 🍊 so you have to pick an 🍋 option really quickly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The main dude, Tashibama, 🍋 is, far and away, the toughest 🍊 and can dispatch just about 🍋 anybody with ease. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Not surprisingly, 🍋 this is based on a manga 🍊 - one by Juzo Tokoro. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It ran from 1984 to 1992 🍊 and seems to be virtually 🍋 unknown in the West. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It did, however, get a 🍋 live-action film adaptation in 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The movie looks utterly ridiculous 🍊 and the title is known in English 🍋 as "West Tako Cheerleaders". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Every level has a boss of sorts; 🍊 in level one, 🍋 he's hiding up in the corner. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've cleared him out, 🍋 you can move on to the next level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You get Experience for winning 🍋 fights and you can Level Up, 🍊 increasing your Health 🍋 and Attack and so on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this game does throw in 🍋 a few more twists and turns. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some levels have 🍋 shortcuts, using manholes, 🍊 though you must jump over 🍊 these barrel things 🍋 rolling along the ground. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Characters will sometimes have 🍋 an option for a special attack 🍊 to appear in the menu; 🍋 this does much heavier damage. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your characters can learn special 🍋 moves as the game progresses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, enemies sometimes 🍋 attack you with weapons, 🍊 such as bamboo swords, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can take these weapons 🍋 from defeated enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, once you have them, you can 🍋 do just huge amounts of damage. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Honestly, these street fights 🍊 start looking more and more like 🍋 straight-up murder at this point. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Meimon! Takonishi Ouendan" 🍋 looks [pretty] decent, 🍊 though in comparison to the, uh, 🍋 other strategy games we've seen 🍊 like last time ("Conflict" 🍋 and "Mirai Senshi Lios") 🍊 it's very very simple and 🍋 obviously, highly repetitive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Still, you might actually 🍋 enjoy this if you give it a try. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Osomatsu-Kun: Back to Zami no Deppa 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 08 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We're in the middle of 🍋 the holiday season 🍊 so tons of games will be 🍋 coming out every single week 🍊 during the month of December. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We have a bunch of titles 🍋 released on December 8th 🍊 but let's start with 🍊 "Osomatsu-Kun: 🍋 Back to Zami no Deppa". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Published by Bandai 🍋 and developed by Tose. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now Tose had developed tons 🍋 of quickie games for Bandai 🍊 going all the way back to 🍋 crap like "Chubby Cherub". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As we've seen, though, 🍋 by the end of '89 🍊 their stuff is actually 🍋 not bad (quality-wise). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Presumably bigger budgets, 🍋 more development time, and so on 🍊 have gradually resulted in 🍋 Bandai games looking [pretty] good. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I think it really helps to have 🍊 pre-established character design 🍋 and art-style, as we have here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Tose is able to reproduce good 🍋 8-bit depictions of manga characters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Back to Zami no Deppa" is 🍋 a menu-based adventure game 🍊 with maybe a slightly 🍋 R.P.G.-ish feel to it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are top-down 🍋 villages and whatnot; 🍊 you have money, health, 🍋 and can sleep at inns. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But it's mostly interacting with 🍋 characters and environments via menus. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you might recall, 🍊 "Osomatsu-Kun" was a very 🍋 long-running manga comic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It started back in the '60s 🍊 and got various animated 🍋 adaptations, games, and so on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is actually the second 🍋 "Osomatsu-Kun" game we've seen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first one 🍋 "Osomatsu-Kun: Hachamecha Gekijou" 🍊 was the fourth game for the 🍋 still quite new Mega Drive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was actually the first 🍋 Sega Mega Drive game 🍊 that wasn't an arcade port. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was released about a year 🍋 before this one in December 1988 🍊 and we covered it in 🍋 "Chronsega Episode 8". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The story of the comic 🍋 is officially about 🍊 a young boy named Osomatsu 🍋 who is one of six sextuplets. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a [pretty] big cast of 🍋 characters, however, and, uh, 🍊 Iyami (the goofy dude we see here) 🍊 in particular plays a really 🍋 big part in the... the comics, 🍊 the, uh, the animated 🍋 cartoon shows, and this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The subtitle is a pun on 🍋 "Back to the Future" 🍊 and this has a 🍋 time-traveling storyline. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You start in Osomatsu's hometown 🍊 and then you interact 🍋 with various characters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's icons for Leave, 🍋 Talk, Show, Examine 🍊 and the light bulb 🍋 means to Think, 🍊 which is a rather unusual 🍋 option for these sorts of games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually you will enter this 🍋 time machine and travel throughout 🍊 time (first to Edo-era Japan 🍋 and later to prehistoric times). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Undoubtedly there's a 🍋 lot of wacky humor here 🍊 but obviously it's lost 🍋 on non-Japanese speakers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Perhaps someday a translation 🍋 for this will appear; 🍊 and until then it's 🍋 difficult to really gauge 🍊 just how good of a game 🍋 this actually is. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shin Satomi Hakkenden 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 08 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Micronics
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toei 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you know, here at 🍋 'Chrontendo' headquarters, 🍊 there is nothing we 🍋 like to see more 🍊 than the names Micronics 🍋 and Toei on a game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And to make things even better 🍋 this is a Japan-[only] R.P.G. 🍊 which quite frankly looks more like 🍋 something out of 1986 than 1989. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Shin Satomi Hakkenden" is the name 🍊 and the cultured among you 🍋 will recognize this as a reference 🍊 to the famous 19th-century novel 🍋 "Nanso Satomi Hakkenden" 🍊 sometimes called 🍋 "Eight Dog Chronicles" in English. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And which itself was inspired 🍋 by the classic Chinese novel, 🍊 [the] "Water Margin". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This plot involves 🍋 eight samurai brothers 🍊 who have various 🍋 samurai-type adventures. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the game you 🍋 actually get to choose 🍊 which of the eight characters 🍋 you wanna start the game with. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Shin Satomi Hakkenden" 🍋 has some clever and fresh ideas 🍊 but it is wrapped up in a 🍋 rather dull and unpolished R.P.G.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now the gimmick of the eight 🍋 different characters works like this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like most R.P.G.s, 🍊 different characters have 🍋 different strengths and weaknesses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, aside from this, each 🍋 character starts in a different town. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You then need to go 🍋 out into the world 🍊 and find the other characters 🍋 and get them to join your party. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, so far, this 🍋 falls [pretty] neatly 🍊 into the 🍋 "Dragon Quest II"-style formula. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Square's Tom Sawyer" 🍋 from last episode was 🍊 another example of this very 🍋 very common J.R.P.G. formula. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But "Shin Satomi Hakkenden" 🍋 mixes up the formula a bit 🍊 by making the game, 🍋 in theory, replayable, 🍊 as it'll feel like 🍋 a different game, 🍊 depending on which 🍋 character you start with. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, once you've recruited 🍋 all of your seven members, 🍊 then at that point 🍋 the game becomes the same 🍊 no matter who you started with. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now this is actually not 🍋 the first game we've seen, 🍊 based on this novel. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The rather similarly titled 🍋 "Satomi Hakkenden" was released 🍋 by S.N.K. in January 1989. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there was a game in which 🍋 the samurai were replaced 🍊 by singing idols 🍋 called "Idol Hakkenden", 🍊 if you can believe that; 🍋 Natsume put out that one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, there was an R.P.G. 🍋 on the P.C. Engine called 🍋 "Makai Hakkenden Shada". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, yes, this is the fourth 🍋 'Satomi Hakkenden' game of 1989 🍊 and probably the last. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But the crazy thing is 🍊 this apparently isn't even a 🍋 direct adaptation of the novel 🍊 but rather it's an adaptation 🍋 of a movie based on the novel 🍊 based on 🍋 "Nanso Satomi Hakkenden". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The title screen 🍋 shows a credit to 🍊 Toshio Kamata and 🍋 Haruki Kadokawa films 🍊 which leads us to 🍋 the 1983 movie 🍊 (known as 🍋 "Legend of the Eight Samurai" 🍋 in English) 🍊 starring Sonny Chiba. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This film was produced 🍋 by Haruki Kadokawa films 🍊 and distributed by Toei. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the screenplay was 🍋 written by Toshio Kamata 🍊 who based it on his 1983 novel 🍋 titled "新・里見八犬伝" 🍊 "Shin Satomi Hakkenden" 🍋 (or "New Satomi Hakkenden"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One piece of trivia: 🍊 The movie was directed 🍋 by Kinji Fukasaku 🍊 one of Japan's great 🍋 directors of action movies 🍊 known for his '70s 🍋 'Yakuza' movies, 🍊 also "Message from Space" 🍋 (the 1978 "Star Wars" rip-off), 🍊 and many many others. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even the folks not 🍋 really familiar with 🍊 Japanese movies of 🍋 the '60s and '70s 🍊 might know him from 🍋 "Battle Royale" 🍊 - the last film he 🍋 completed before he died. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And video game fans might 🍋 recall his involvement in 🍊 the Playstation 2 game 🍋 "Clock Tower 3". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, despite this, 🍊 there's no obvious connection 🍋 between the game and the movie. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game box art uses 🍊 a [pretty] generic-looking 🍋 piece of artwork on the front 🍊 (though on the back the 🍋 illustrations of the characters 🍊 do match their appearance 🍋 in the movie). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the game itself feels like 🍊 a [pretty] generic R.P.G. 🍋 for the most part 🍊 (though, as mentioned, it's 🍋 [pretty] unpolished and ugly-looking). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It has a fondness for 🍋 maze-like world design. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's usually [only] one 🍋 narrow path through a village. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can't just walk around freely, 🍊 uh, since obstructions like trees, 🍋 fences, and buildings block you 🍊 from venturing outside 🍋 the designated path. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This leads to problems 🍊 with N.P.C.s even being more 🍋 obnoxious when they get in your way 🍊 since the village paths are 🍋 usually [only] one tile wide. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's literally no way of reaching 🍋 the other side of this village 🍊 until this guy decides to move. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The overworld is also filled 🍋 with these little valleys 🍊 that wind their way through 🍋 mountains and such. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Some parts do open up a bit more 🍋 but the game mostly forces you 🍊 to take very specific routes 🍋 from one town to the other. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You can [only] save in castles 🍊 so one of the first things 🍋 you'll need to do is find one 🍊 before you get killed by monsters 🍋 and thus forced to restart the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Combat is unbalanced. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can take three steps 🍋 outside the village 🍊 and get instantly killed by a 🍋 wandering monster in one hit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also the battles have music but no 🍋 sound effects which feels very odd. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 More technically accomplished 🍋 games like "Dragon Quest" 🍊 use a visual cue (like a slight 🍋 screen shake) when you get hit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By comparison, 🍊 "Shin Satomi, uh, Hakkenden" 🍋 with its totally static screens 🍊 and no sound effects 🍋 feels [pretty] lifeless. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there's a variety of 🍋 technical issues with this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently, later in the game, when 🍋 you have all eight party members 🍊 it stops updating your 🍋 characters' Hit Points 🍊 when they get hit during battles 🍋 until the turn is over 🍊 and then everyone's 🍋 Hit Points update all at once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When there are multiple enemies, 🍋 you can't select which ones to attack; 🍊 instead your party 🍋 members attack randomly, 🍊 which greatly diminishes the 🍋 tactical aspect of the battles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Overall, the game looks 🍋 interesting, in theory, 🍊 but perhaps it would've 🍋 been better off with 🍊 a more technically-capable 🍋 developer than Micronics. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Seirei Gari 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 08 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Advance Communication
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hudson Soft is in sort of a 🍋 strange position here: 🍊 both publishing games for the FamiCom 🍊 while, at the same time, being the 🍋 primary publisher for a competing console 🍊 (which they had even helped [design]) 🍋 - the P.C. Engine. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Seirei Gari" was 🍋 published by Hudson Soft 🍊 but the development work was 🍋 farmed out to Advanced Communications. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sort of a low-end developer 🍊 responsible most famously for 🍋 "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" 🍊 and a number of mostly-forgotten 🍋 oddball titles like "Circus Caper". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The title screen is annoying. 🍊 when it appears you have around 🍋 two seconds to press Start; 🍊 otherwise it loads up 🍋 the intro cutscene. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you might suspect from 🍋 the screen layout here, 🍊 this is approximately 🍋 the one-millionth 🍊 menu-based adventure game 🍋 released for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For the purpose of this video, we'll 🍋 check out this unofficial translation, 🍊 uh, which titles the game 🍋 "Ghost Hunter". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So our heroes are eating 🍋 breakfast or something 🍊 when this Rosenkreutz just 🍋 sort of appears out of nowhere 🍊 and announces his evil intentions 🍋 (as video game villains often do). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, he then 🍋 kills the kindly 'Grampa' 🍊 and steals the hero's girlfriend. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's interesting; 🍊 this game suffers from 🍋 some rather ugly artwork 🍊 and none-too-exciting 🍋 environments and puzzles 🍊 but has some fantastic music. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So after being 🍋 knocked out by Rosenkreutz 🍊 you'll wake up in a hospital 🍋 where one of the doctors 🍊 just happens to be 🍋 some sort of expert 🍊 on mysterious phenomena 🍋 and whatnot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you hightail it to what I 🍋 believe is Rosenkreutz' house 🍊 to check for clues. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You have the standard 🍋 menu of options 🍊 (maybe a bit simplified compared 🍋 to the 'Osomatsu-Kun' game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's Check, Speak, 🍋 Take, Use and Go. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For the most part you Check a 🍋 new screen when you enter it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This will open up some new things 🍋 to Check and sometimes you will 🍊 find an object to Take or Use. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, in Rosenkreutz's 🍋 house you'll enter a room, 🍊 find a key, 🍋 use it to unlock another room, 🍊 find another key, 🍋 and then enter another room 🍊 where you find a letter, which 🍋 leads you to the next location. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now the note leads our heroes 🍋 in the direction of Shambhala 🍊 - which is going to be tricky to 🍋 get to because it's a legendary city 🍊 mentioned in old Taoist 🍋 and Buddhist writings. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Seirei Gari" combines all sorts of 🍋 esoteric ideas, both Eastern and Western. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The name of the villain, 🍋 uh, Christian Rosenkreutz, 🍊 refers to the supposed founder of 🍋 'The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The history of Rosicrucianism 🍋 is quite odd 🍊 but I'll simply say that in 🍋 [the] 17th-century Germany 🍊 some anonymous pamphlets 🍋 caused quite a stir in Europe 🍊 due to the wild 🍋 ideas they contained. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The author claimed to be a 🍋 member of some secret society 🍊 that existed for hundreds of years 🍊 and was founded by one 🍋 Christian Rosenkreutz. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While externally believed that 🍋 the pamphlet's author just made up 🍊 Rosenkreutz and the 🍋 Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross 🍊 there are groups today that still 🍋 call themselves Rosicrucians. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are various other references to 🍋 esoteric figures such as King Solomon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And here, in the village of Asuka, we 🍋 find various mysterious rock structures 🍊 which lead to Shambhala - somehow. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The goal in this village is 🍋 to find the hidden entrance 🍊 to the tunnels under the rock 🍋 and this puzzle is solved by 🍊 visiting bird stores, bars, temples, 🍋 speaking to the curator of the local museum, 🍊 and, of course, picking up various objects 🍋 and using them in unintuitive ways. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 By the way, Asuka is a real place. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a village in Nara 🍊 which was the capital of Japan 🍋 in the 7th-century. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are a number of important 🍋 old temples there and, uh, 🍊 the stone structures (like this one 🍋 - Turtle Rock) are absolutely real. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I hesitate to call 🍋 "Seirei Gari" a bad game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's an intriguing subject for a 🍋 game; some parts are kind of cool 🍊 but overall it's just 🍋 not very well developed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And its construction is 🍋 [pretty] damn generic 🍊 even for a Japanese 🍋 adventure game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Taito Chase H.Q. 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 08 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Disco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well here's another fine example 🍋 of a game with great music 🍊 but the game itself 🍋 isn't really that hot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Taito Chase H.Q." 🍋 was, for some reason, 🍊 never released outside of Japan 🍊 despite being based on a 🍋 popular arcade hit from 1988. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Almost everything about this 🍋 is just so ugly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The developer is 🍋 credited as 'Disco' 🍊 - a name that pops up on 🍋 various Taito FamiCom ports. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It appears to be an 🍋 internal division of Taito 🍊 that was responsible for 🍋 producing home versions of games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While I don't know 🍋 anything about how 🍊 the FamiCom "Taito Chase H.Q." 🍋 was created 🍊 it's almost a case-study 🍋 in how not to make 🍊 a console version 🍋 of an arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Whereas ideally a FamiCom 🍋 version of an arcade game 🍊 would add more, sort of, 🍋 'consoley' elements 🍊 to lengthen or deepen the game 🍊 (in order to make up 🍋 for the fact that, uh, 🍊 a lot is going to be lost 🍋 in terms of visual excitement),
✅🏮🍊 here, Taito simply released a 🍋 badly crippled version of the original. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now the premise is simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You are some sort of 🍋 Miami Vicey-type cop 🍊 whose speciality is 🍋 high-speed freeway chases. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, your unit's name is the 🍋 Chase Special Investigation Department. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your mission is to chase down 🍋 a series of fleeing criminals 🍊 (starting with 🍋 'Ralph the Idaho Slasher') 🍊 and get them to surrender 🍊 by repeatedly ramming their car 🍋 until it bursts into flames 🍊 and then the bad guys 🍋 have to abandon ship. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You then get a little scene of you 🍋 apprehending the criminal scum. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The arcade game which was 🍋 simply titled "Chase H.Q." 🍊 sort of resembled an 🍋 action-packed version of "Outrun". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In glorious sprite-based 3D, 🍊 you drive through cities, deserts, 🍋 forests, tunnels, and so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The arcade cabinet was 🍋 a sit-down-style cab 🍊 with a gear shift 🍋 controller and so on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It was massively popular and got 🍋 ported to every possible platform 🍊 including the Genesis 🍋 and P.C. Engine 🍊 which, of course, we'll 🍋 have to cover later. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was even released 🍋 on the Game Boy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ocean's Z.X Spectrum port 🍋 (despite being slow-moving and ugly) 🍊 apparently was voted 🍋 'the best Spectrum game ever' 🍊 in a 1993 magazine bowl. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though I've, at this point, 🍋 [pretty] much given up 🍊 trying to understand the mindset 🍋 of Spectrum aficionados. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well the problem here is that 🍋 "Chase H.Q." was, you know, 🍊 all about spectacular visuals 🍋 and fast-paced excitement 🍊 and that really can't be 🍋 translated to the FamiCom game 🍊 which looks like an 🍋 uglier-than-average racing game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The music is severely downgraded 🍊 and most of the speech samples 🍋 have been removed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 They did add a few twists 🍊 such as between rounds being able 🍋 to purchase vehicle upgrades 🍊 which supposedly 🍋 enhance performance. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I was hoping oil would allow you 🍊 to produce a "Spy Hunter"-style 🍋 oil slick but no such luck. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the original game has you 🍋 going off-road at certain points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Taito Chase H.Q." doesn't even 🍋 try to replicate that visually 🍊 but it still throws in tumbleweeds 🍋 growing in the middle of the freeway 🍊 which is [pretty] damn stupid-looking. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One other new thing 🍋 in the home version 🍊 were these forks in the road. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Taking the correct turn 🍋 will either dramatically 🍊 lengthen or shorten the route 🍋 to the target car. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A couple levels in the arcade game 🍋 did have diverging paths like this 🍊 but they didn't really seem to 🍋 impact the game that much, 🍊 as far as I can recall. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Whereas, here, 🍋 taking the wrong path 🍊 makes it virtually impossible 🍋 to reach the target car on time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Famitsu gave this a 24 out of 40 🍋 (which sounds about right to me). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Really, this is one of 🍋 the more disappointing 🍊 arcade ports on the FamiCom 🍋 (at least by 1989 standards). 🍇🍌

✅🏮🍊🍓 Wow! Here's an unusual one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Super Mogura Tataki!! Pokkun Mogura" 🍋 from I.G.S., 🍊 developed by Lord-knows-who. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not every day we get to see 🍋 a new publisher for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I.G.S. (whose logo tells us is short 🍋 for Information Global Service) 🍊 is a company that no one 🍋 really seems to know 🍊 or care anything about. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They released a few 🍋 games in the U.S. 🍊 - uh, "Rocketeer" 🍋 for the Super Nintendo, 🍊 "Violent Soldier" 🍋 for the TurboGrafx-16. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They must have had some kind 🍋 of connection to Taito. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 the N.E.S. game "Puzznic" 🍊 was published by 🍋 Taito in the U.S. 🍊 instead of I.G.S., 🍋 as it was in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were putting out games 🍋 until around 1993 🍊 and they are one of the very 🍋 few Japanese game publishers 🍊 for Nintendo consoles that 🍊 don't have a Japanese Wikipedia 🍋 page dedicated to them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So "Super Mogura Tataki..." 🍋 is a whack-a-mole game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It came with this little pad 🍊 that plugged into the expansion port 🍋 of the FamiCom and a small hammer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, while the concept is obviously 🍋 inspired by the Power Pad, 🍊 this thing is much smaller. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's, uh, [only] a few 🍋 inches longer and wider 🍊 than a U.S. 🍋 Nintendo Entertainment System 🍊 so don't go thinking this 🍋 is comparable in size to an 🍊 actual mechanical whack-a-mole game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Use the hammer to hit the 🍋 little creatures that pop up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Different colors are worth 🍋 different amounts of points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a 60-second timer and once 🍋 it reaches zero the round is over. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you hit 80% or more of the [targets], 🍋 you go on to the next stage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Otherwise you have to repeat the 🍋 level until you reach the target. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a bonus stage but it's just a 🍋 few extra seconds of hitting enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are six stages altogether. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They don't all use the 🍋 entire 16 spaces on the mat 🍊 but often just the 🍋 right-most 12 spaces 🍊 or the bottom-most 12. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While there's really 🍋 not much to this game, 🍊 I... 🍋 I really can't hate it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like today, game companies 🍋 need to produce games for, uh, 🍊 the younger demographic 🍊 and I can see little kids 🍋 getting a kick out of this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, for those 🍋 watching this video, 🍊 its appeal is going to be limited 🍊 but it probably would have been, 🍋 you know, [pretty] fun for a while 🍊 when you were a little kid. 🍇🍌

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Super Star Pro Wrestling!"🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The last game of 🍋 the second week of December 🍊 and it's a Wrestling Game 🍋 from Pony Canyon. Yay. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is 🍋 "Super Star Pro Wrestling". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Is he smoking a cigar? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We have a roster, here, of 🍋 real-life famous wrestlers 🍊 (12 altogether) 🍋 including a few Western wrestlers 🍊 like Andre the Giant 🍋 and The Road Warriors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We also have this odd fellow 🍊 who is playable just like 🍋 all the rest of them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are, of course, both 🍋 1-Player and 2-Player options. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The default 1-Player mode is 🍋 sort of a championship mode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to defeat each wrestler 🍋 in consecutive bouts. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now each playable wrestler 🍊 has a number of signature moves 🍋 that you can pull off 🍊 and you choose four per match. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You map these onto the D-Pad 🍋 in this menu page, here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The actual gameplay is similar 🍋 to most other Wrestling Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the ring you can either 🍋 punch or kick your opponent. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Doing so several times in a row 🍋 will cause them to drop to one knee. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You then press the A button 🍋 and use the D-Pad 🍊 to select one of 🍋 your special moves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A meter will appear at this point 🍊 with the bars going up 🍋 and down crazily fast. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Releasing the button 🍋 will execute the move 🍊 and the number of bars on 🍋 the meter at that point 🍊 will determine the 🍋 strength of the attack. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can then further attack your 🍋 opponent while he's on the ground 🍊 either pinning him or picking 🍋 him up and attacking again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Some other fun options here: 🍋 you can throw him out of the ring, 🍊 at some point a wrench will appear 🍊 (which can then be used 🍋 to clock him on the head). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's a variety 🍋 of standard attacks 🍊 as well such as running 🍋 your opponent into a clothesline, 🍊 throwing him, um, 🍋 against the ropes, 🍊 and if he's on the... 🍋 the ground near a corner 🍊 you can climb on the 🍋 turnbuckle and jump on him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, as you might know, 🍋 a localized version of this 🍊 was released by F.C.I. 🍋 in The United States, 🍊 under the name "W.C.W Wrestling" 🍋 in April 1990. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though some people also call the game 🍋 "W.C.W World Championship Wrestling" 🍊 (or maybe the name is just 🍋 "World Championship Wrestling" 🍊 - I'm not sure). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You may have noticed that games 🍋 are often getting Western releases 🍊 more and more quickly 🍋 at this point 🍊 - often just a few months 🍋 after the Japanese release. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is, of course, 🍋 a fully licensed game 🍊 which features the 🍋 likenesses and names 🍊 of 12 popular W.C.W stars 🍊 such as Ric Flair, Sting, 🍋 Lex Luger, and a few others. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, W.C.W. began life 🍊 as a wrestling promotion 🍋 owned by Jim Crockett Jr. 🍊 (a promoter from North Carolina 🍊 who bought out a number of other 🍋 regional wrestling promotions 🍊 in the 1980s) 🍊 in an attempt to 🍋 compete with the W.W.F.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In 1988 the media mogul, 🍋 Ted Turner, bought out Crockett 🍊 and the thing was officially named 🍋 World Championship Wrestling. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now W.C.W was actually 🍋 not really that successful 🍊 when this game came out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But by the mid-'90s it was 🍋 actually beating out the W.W.F. 🍊 in the television ratings. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, it eventually all 🍋 came crashing down very quickly 🍊 and in 2000, uh, the company 🍋 was absorbed into the W.W.F.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the '90s, however, there was, 🍋 like, a brief golden age for the W.C.W 🍊 and a number of, uh, 🍋 games were released 🍊 for the Nintendo 64 and 🍋 Playstation and such. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game certainly has its fans 🍊 and, as someone who 🍋 personally doesn't 🍊 have any particular interest 🍋 in wrestling or Wrestling Games, 🍊 it's kind of hard 🍋 for me to judge this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was developed by Nichibutsu 🍊 who is not exactly the 🍋 slickest developer out there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It isn't a particularly 🍋 attractive-looking game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are a few things I don't 🍋 like about the style of gameplay. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, you can use 🍋 punches and kicks in the ring 🍊 but I'm not sure what 🍋 the point of the punch is 🍊 because it has a shorter reach 🍋 than the kick. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you'll always get 🍋 hit with a kick 🍊 before you can get 🍋 in punching range. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game tends to fall into a 🍋 pattern of both opponents kicking 🍊 until one wrestler 🍋 drops to his knees; 🍊 then a special move 🍋 can be used on him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's no visible power meter 🍋 so I don't know when you can tell 🍊 when the appropriate time 🍋 to try to pin an opponent is. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 During one match I immediately 🍋 got put into a hold 🍊 and my wrestler 🍋 actually then gave up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The entire match lasted 🍋 maybe 20 seconds. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The manual says you can 🍋 break out of a hold 🍊 but I couldn't seem to 🍋 get it to work in this case. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So with its wide variety of options, 🍋 wrestlers, special moves, and so on 🍊 "W.C.W Wrestling" certainly looks 🍋 like an appealing game, on paper. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I saw that some folks 🍋 online have called it 🍊 the best N.E.S. Wrestling Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It didn't really appeal much to me 🍊 but, by all means, 🍋 decide for yourself. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Abadox 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 15 🇯🇵 // 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Natsume
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Natsume 🇯🇵 // Milton Bradley 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ew! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We enter the third round of 🍋 December releases with "Abadox" 🍊 - a biological themed 🍋 shooter from Natsume. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So your little dude flies into the 🍋 gigantic mouth of this living planet. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The U.S. manual calls 🍋 the planet 'Parasitis' 🍊 and claims that it swallowed up 🍋 an orbiting hospital ship 🍊 which had a princess on board. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, so somehow a 🍋 'rescue the princess' plot 🍊 got shoehorned into this thing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So "Abadox" is very clearly 🍋 "Gradius"-like. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well actually, more than "Gradius", 🍊 it resembles "Salamander" 🍋 (a.k.a. "Life Force") 🍊 with the whole biological theme. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It begins almost exactly like 🍋 every other "Gradius" clone. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You shoot a few rows of enemies 🍋 and then get a speed boost powerup. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can also find missiles 🍋 and a barrier shield 🍊 that works sort of like 🍋 the options from "Gradius". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first boss, here, is 🍋 some sort of skeletal dog(!?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So "Abadox" is definitely 🍋 not original at all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However what it 🍋 lacks in originality 🍊 it makes up for in 🍋 general awesomeness. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It takes elements from other games 🍊 and mixes them into a 🍋 surprisingly enjoyable mishmash. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually a bit more 🍋 consistent than "Salamander" 🍊 when it comes to keeping with 🍋 the whole 'biological' thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It mixes in downward 🍋 vertical levels 🍊 with the standard 🍋 horizontal levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This, right here, 🍋 is apparently the throat 🍊 and you more or less travel 🍋 through the planet's digestive system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Look at all these disgusting 🍋 organic walls which kind of pulse. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The art design is 🍋 so good in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the boss, here, 🍋 is some kind of orifice. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Abadox" is relatively difficult; 🍊 like so many of these other games 🍋 there's sort of like a rule 🍊 that you should not die 🍋 in the wrong place. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Getting killed strips you 🍋 of all your powerups 🍊 which suddenly makes the game 🍋 much much much tougher. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily the barriers 🍋 and protective shields 🍊 give you the ability to 🍋 take a few hits before dying. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's lots of great 🍋 environmental hazards here as well 🍊 like these giant teeth 🍋 that get in your way. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Almost all the bosses are 🍋 quite weird and creepy; 🍊 like look at this guy! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now there is one rather strange 🍋 spaceship, sort of,-looking level 🍊 in which the boss is a large robot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, for the most part, "Abadox" 🍊 keeps [pretty] close to the balance 🍋 of organic and mechanical elements. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this might be 🍋 disappointing to some 🍊 but the final boss is one of those 🍊 that you can easily defeat in, 🍋 like, two seconds if you know how. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Basically you just go right up to 🍋 the left eye and then blast away. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So that's the Princess!? 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 What happened to her clothes? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the Japanese version, 🍋 by the way. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For the U.S. release, 🍋 they gave her, sort of, like, 🍊 uh, a purple leotard thing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the ending is, of course, 🍋 one of those super fast 🍊 escape-from-the-base levels 🍋 (you know, before it explodes?) 🍊 - [pretty] much designed to 🍊 eat up any, uh, extra lives 🍋 you might have left. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually a real dick move 🍋 to end the game with this, 🍊 in my opinion, 🍊 since you'd get [pretty] much 🍋 all the way through it 🍊 and then die and not be 🍋 able to see the ending. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now we've seen way more 🍋 crappy shooters on the FamiCom 🍊 than we have good ones; 🍋 that's undeniable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Abadox" definitely falls 🍋 into the Good category. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned, it lacks any 🍋 kind of originality whatsoever 🍊 - but it makes up for this by 🍋 being [pretty] damn rad-looking, 🍊 having really great music, 🍋 and just being fun to play. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Katte ni Shiro Kuma 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 15 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Graphic Research
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by CBS Sony 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Let me tell you - 🍊 the things that I have to tolerate 🍋 during the course of this series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here is yet another 🍋 licensed property game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The full name of this is quite long 🍊 so we'll just refer to it 🍋 simply as "Katte ni Shirokuma". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Published by C.B.S. (who mostly 🍋 did licensed junk at this point) 🍊 and developed by Graphic Research. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's the same guys who did 🍋 "Meimon! Takonishi Ouendan" 🍊 (the first game this episode). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We haven't seen tons of 🍋 Graphic Research titles 🍊 so it's kind of surprising to 🍋 end up with two in one episode. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So you start off this game 🍋 by talking to God... 🍊 or at least some 🍋 sort of nature deity. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Katte ni Shirokuma" is, once again, 🍋 a menu-based adventure game 🍊 but with some vaguely 🍋 R.P.G. elements thrown in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, you might notice 🍊 you have Hit Points 🍋 as well as I.Q Points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later in the game (much later) 🍊 you will encounter enemies 🍋 and R.P.G.-style battles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the entire first 🍋 chunk of the game 🍊 mostly involves you walking around 🍋 in a "Dragon Quest"y-type overworld 🍊 interacting with the 🍋 environment and other animals. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now this is sort of an 🍋 unusual idea for a video game 🍊 so imagine my surprise 🍋 when it turned out that 🍊 "Katte ni Shirokuma" 🍋 is also a manga 🍊 from the pen of one Koji Aihara. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It ran in "Weekly Shonen Jump" 🍋 from 1983 to 1986. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a nature comic, 🍋 based on the lives 🍊 of a group of slightly 🍋 anthropomorphized animals 🍊 living in the wilderness. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now I was shocked 🍋 (shocked, I say!) 🍊 to learn there was also an 🍋 anime which came out in 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Neither the game nor the anime 🍊 seemed to be particularly 🍋 well-remembered today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I didn't find many 🍋 gameplay videos on YouTube 🍊 though naturally one fellow 🍊 did a series of videos 🍋 on the game on Niconico. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Shiro, the main character, looks 🍋 like he's probably a polar bear 🍊 but is, in fact, supposed to be 🍋 an albino Japanese brown bear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's friends with a few 🍋 other bears and a boar. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You have your standard 🍋 menu commands here; 🍊 the game starts off in 🍋 a [pretty] prosaic fashion. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You talk to nearby animals, 🍋 explore the area, 🍊 eventually you encounter 🍋 some mysterious tracks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At various points a 🍋 conversation will occur 🍊 which will result in you getting 🍋 some Hit Points or I.Q Points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually [you'll be] 🍋 able to switch characters 🍊 and eventually get the other two 🍋 characters to join your party. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One annoying thing is that, 🍊 unlike the single-tile sized 🍋 characters in most R.P.G.s, 🍊 Shiro is more than one tile long 🍊 and it can be annoying [to] 🍋 try to get him lined up correctly, 🍊 when trying to enter a cave entrance 🍋 or cross over a bridge. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently this gets much worse, 🍋 later in the game, 🍊 when you have two other characters 🍋 tagging along behind him. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Realistically, 🍋 "Katte ni Shirokuma" is a game 🍊 you will probably not want to play 🍋 for more than about two minutes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's unlikely to get a 🍋 translation anytime soon 🍊 and it probably rightly deserves 🍊 its place on the scrap heap 🍋 of forgotten FamiCom games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gekitou!! Stadium 🇯🇵 // Bad News Baseball 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 15 🇯🇵 // 1990 June [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tecmo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tecmo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Somehow we lucked out last episode 🍋 and didn't have a single Baseball Game 🍊 (at least as far as I can recall). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No such luck today, though. 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 "Gekitou!! Stadium" from Tecmo. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Boy! A Baseball Game from Tecmo 🍋 sounds promising, right? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, "Tecmo Bowl" is good, 🍋 right? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well... I hate to disappoint you 🍋 but "Gekitou!! Stadium" is, 🍊 at its core, a straight-up clone of 🍋 Namco's 'Family Stadium' series 🍊 (the first game, of course, 🍊 you'll remember being released in 🍋 the U.S. as "R.B.I. Baseball"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, look at... 🍊 it even has the word 'Stadium' 🍋 right there in the title! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You choose teams based on 🍋 real-life baseball teams 🍊 (though, of course, no actual 🍋 team names or logos are displayed). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While the... the game itself is 🍊 virtually identical to many of the 🍋 Baseball Games we've seen before 🍊 there are a few nice touches that 🍋 makes it stand out a little bit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, those nice little 🍋 animations that sometimes appear 🍊 when a certain action occurs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, when throwing 🍋 the ball to a baseman 🍊 and the runner tries to slide 🍋 you might get this animation. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, uh, there are some other 🍋 interesting features like: 🍊 - the umpires are all rabbits 🍋 (for a completely undisclosed reason); 🍊 - every time a runner gets called Out, 🍊 he doesn't just, uh, turn around 🍋 and head back to the dugout; 🍊 he actually falls to the 🍋 ground as if unconscious. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 My theory is that "Gekitou!! Stadium" 🍋 takes place in some dystopian future 🍊 world where athletes are forced to wear, 🍋 like, shock collars that zap them, uh, 🍊 into unconsciousness when they fail. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's just my theory. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Tecmo released most of their 🍋 sports games in the U.S. as well, 🍊 so "Gekitou!! Stadium" 🍋 came out here as, uh, 🍊 "Bad News Baseball" in 1990. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The American title makes a 🍋 [pretty] untimely reference 🍊 to the 'Bad News Bears' movies 🍋 (the last of which, 🍊 "Bad News Bears go to Japan" 🍋 came out 12 years earlier). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For the U.S. version, 🍋 very little has changed, 🍊 aside from translating the text. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The two versions are [pretty] much 🍋 completely identical. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a reasonably slick (though 🍋 rather generic) Baseball Game 🍊 which is perhaps a bit 🍋 disappointing, coming off of, uh, 🍊 "Dusty Diamond's All-Star Softball" 🍋 from two episodes ago. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The two-player game is fine 🍊 but playing against 🍋 the A.I. is brutal, 🍊 even by N.E.S. 🍋 Baseball Game standards. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The computer's team will catch 🍋 just about every single Hit you get. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And when he's at the bat 🍋 he almost never gets a Strike 🍊 and gets Home Runs on 🍋 a [pretty] frequent basis. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the other hand, I very rarely 🍋 got a Foul Ball when I was batting 🍊 so at least there's one improvement 🍋 over most other Baseball Games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One last feature I'll mention 🍋 is the hidden option 🍊 to switch to a girls' team 🍋 instead of the boys' team. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is done by holding down 🍋 buttons on the controllers 🍊 while turning on [the] console. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This option is purely superficial; 🍊 it just changes the names and the 🍋 sprites, but it is a nice touch. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So that [pretty] much sums up 🍋 "Gekitou!! Stadium" 🍊 - a bog standard Baseball Game 🍊 made slightly better by 🍋 adding in a few nice touches. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shinsenden 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 15 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tamtex
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, here we have 🍋 "Shinsenden", 🍊 an R.P.G. from IREM 🍋 and developed by Tamtex. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Tamtex was actually an internal 🍋 development division within IREM. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, unlike some of the more 🍋 shadowy development companies, 🍊 their name and logo is featured 🍋 prominently when you start up the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is actually IREM's 🍋 first R.P.G. for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They've released 🍋 a few adventure games, 🍊 a strategy game, Puzzle Games, 🍊 one excellent Compile-developed 🍋 Shoot-'em-Up, 🍊 a number of sports games, 🍊 and last episode they had one 🍋 of those Mini Yonku car games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But somehow they've completely 🍋 avoided R.P.G.s until now. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We're fortunate to have an 🍋 unofficial fan translation here 🍊 so we can appreciate 🍋 the details of the story. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It begins in medias res with this 🍋 dude escaping from some bad guys... 🍊 then cuts away and 🍋 introduces our hero. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the kind of 🍋 dramatic opening sequence 🍊 that first appeared in FamiCom 🍋 R.P.G.s in "Dragon Quest II" 🍊 and has since become 🍋 kind of a standard thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is very very much in the 🍋 standard FamiCom R.P.G.-style. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You play a young hero 🍋 who gets sent on a mission 🍊 which eventually turns into 🍊 a grand heroic quest to 🍋 save the world or something. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You begin with one companion, 🍋 a female monk 🍊 (which are normally called 🍋 'nuns', by the way) 🍊 named Raichi. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And wow! 🍋 She's a bit on the young side. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Can you even really consent to 🍋 becoming a monk at that age? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now it's worth noting just how 🍋 formulaic J.R.P.G.s have become 🍊 at this point, um, 🍋 and really [only]... 🍊 it's been around two years' 🍋 time since "Dragon Quest II". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So certain J.R.P.G. cliches 🍊 such as finding useful items 🍋 hiding in jars in the village 🍊 are... are found here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We also have the inn 🍋 in the first village, 🍊 which will heal you for free. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the next village, 🍋 we have a guy who can 🍊 resurrect dead party members 🍋 and save your game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, we have the 🍋 Item Shop and the Weapon Shop. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your first order of business 🍊 (and the game actually 🍋 specifically tells you to do this) 🍊 is to get some decent armor 🍋 and weapons at the nearby village. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, you'll need money 🍊 so we start by wandering around the 🍋 first village for an hour or so, 🍊 fighting monsters and healing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Everything in the battle system 🍋 is completely intuitive 🍊 to anyone who's played any 🍋 of these things before. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You take turns attacking; 🍊 Raichi quickly gets 🍋 a fire spell and a healing spell 🍊 once she gains a couple levels 🍋 (which is very helpful). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your main character is focused 🍋 more on physical attacks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Occasionally you can 🍋 evade an attack. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And sometimes score a 🍋 quote-unquote "direct attack" 🍊 which is like a critical strike 🍋 or something and does extra damage. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You select a group 🍋 of enemies to attack 🍊 and if both characters 🍋 attack the same group 🍊 and your first character 🍋 successfully kills that enemy 🍊 your second character will 🍋 not re-target another enemy, 🍊 but rather instead just do nothing 🍋 (just like "Final Fantasy" I). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is something 🍊 that people complained a lot 🍋 about in these early R.P.G.s 🍊 but, um, you know, was 🍋 [pretty] standard at the time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, once you've built up enough levels 🍋 and gold to buy decent equipment 🍊 you can head on out to 🍋 your first real quest: 🍋 a nearby cave. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'll point out that "Shinsenden" 🍋 can be brutally difficult! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Random enemy encounters 🍋 are very frequent 🍊 and there were many cases, um, where 🍋 after defeating a group of enemies 🍊 I took literally one step forward 🍋 and got another random encounter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're playing this 🍋 on [an] emulator 🍊 you'll want to use 🍋 save states constantly. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your first boss encounter 🍋 will net you a better sword 🍊 and it's not so much that 🍊 the bosses or enemies are 🍋 really that tough, exactly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just that there 🍋 are so many fights 🍊 and it's easy to use up all 🍋 your magic and healing items 🍊 in the middle of the dungeon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Shinsenden" 🍋 (like "Dragon Quest II" 🍋 or "Final Fantasy II") 🍊 does have a plot of sorts 🍊 and quite a few scripted events 🍋 that propel the action forward. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You encounter the dude from the 🍋 prologue in the dungeon, 🍊 which sort of opens up the main plot 🍋 regarding various powerful 🍋 mystic swords or something. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One rather, uh, 🍋 pleasing aspect of this game 🍊 (which is something I don't think 🍋 I've really seen much 🍋 before in these R.P.G.s) 🍊 is that various cutscenes 🍋 will actually move you 🍊 from one part of the map 🍋 to the other. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, for example, when you get 🍋 to the end of the first dungeon 🍊 the game sort of flashes forward 🍋 to the first village 🍊 so you don't actually have 🍋 to trek all the way back 🍋 through the dungeon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thus avoiding a very 🍋 irritating part of old R.P.G.s 🍊 when you defeat the boss 🍋 but are then low on health 🍊 and get killed before 🍋 you reach a save point. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, party members 🍋 will come and go; 🍊 Raichi gets kidnapped and 🍋 some other guy joins your party. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this continues 🍋 throughout the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is something we've seen 🍋 in a few games previously, 🍊 such as "Final Fantasy II". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So "Shinsenden" is not going to 🍋 set anyone's world on fire 🍊 but it is a [pretty] nice 🍋 example of a R.P.G. 🍊 from the middle of the FamiCom era. 🍇🍌

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not a game that I 🍋 particularly cared for 🍊 but nonetheless a 🍋 big ambitious game 🍊 from a titanic figure in gaming: 🍋 Tokuro Fujiwara. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, to start off, you have 🍋 five characters you must name. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Naturally they also 🍋 have default names 🍊 taken from the 🍋 "Sweet Home" movie. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, yes, if you didn't know, this 🍋 is sort of a movie adaptation. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So while "Sweet Home" 🍋 was [only] released in Japan 🍊 we do have a recent English 🍋 translation from 2017 🍋 by The Siege and JMN 🍊 to replace the old translation 🍋 from, like, 15 years ago. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's supposedly 🍋 a bit more accurate. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Sweet Home" begins 🍋 with a five-man film crew 🍋 entering the Mamiya mansion. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The former residence of 🍋 the now-deceased painter, 🍋 Ichiro Mamiya. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Trouble begins when an earthquake 🍋 (or some other mysterious phenomenon) 🍊 hits the mansion, 🍋 blocking the exit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So I suppose the goal of the game 🍋 is simply to get out of the house. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'd think that you could 🍋 just walk out the back door. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, there must be a 🍋 servants' entrance or something, 🍊 in a mansion this size, but no; 🍊 the place is crawling 🍋 with monsters and ghosts 🍊 and many of the doors are locked. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One unusual mechanic here: 🍊 you need to split your 🍋 five-member group into teams. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For some reason the most members 🍋 you can put into a group is three 🍊 so you'll need to usually have 🍋 a one three member group 🍋 and one two member group 🍊 (which are controlled separately). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You use the menu to switch back 🍋 and forth between the two groups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is both the most unique 🍋 thing about "Sweet Home" 🍊 and the most annoying 🍋 thing about it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Sweet Home" is more or less an 🍋 R.P.G. 🍊 (though one that 🍋 dispenses with most of the 🍊 normal R.P.G. conventions, 🍋 as we shall see later). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So this is certainly an 🍋 original and fascinating game 🍊 but it's mostly remembered today 🍋 as being, sort of, 🍋 the prototype for "Resident Evil". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Tokuro Fujiwara's original 🍋 intention for "Resident Evil" 🍊 was to make sort of an updated 🍋 3D version of "Sweet Home". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And a number of folks 🍋 call "Sweet Home" 🍊 the first quote unquote 🍋 "survival horror game". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, in fact, it does have 🍋 certain similarities to 🍊 "Resident Evil" and "Silent Hill" 🍋 and those kinds of games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One of these is the extremely 🍋 limited inventory space. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each character can hold 🍋 one weapon and two items. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 They also have an 🍋 additional inventory slot 🍊 which is occupied 🍋 by a special item 🍊 that is unique to each character 🍋 and which cannot be unequipped. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, Asuka's special item 🍋 is the vacuum cleaner 🍋 (you know, because she's a woman) 🍊 which is used to clean 🍋 broken glass out of the way 🍊 and also to clean, uh, 🍋 the dust off the murals 🍊 so that they can be photographed 🍊 (which, by the way, is done 🍋 using Taguchi's camera). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The other three items are 🍊 Akiko's remedy 🍋 (which is used for 🍋 curing status ailments), 🍊 Kazuo's lighter 🍋 (which is rather oddly used 🍊 to burn pieces of rope 🍋 which sometimes block your way), 🍊 and finally Emi's key 🍋 (which is used to unlock doors). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So three out of the five items 🍋 are mostly used to 🍋 get past obstacles in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now the upshot of the 🍋 limited inventory space 🍊 is that you will almost always 🍊 have to drop an item 🍋 when you find a new one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Among the items you can find, 🍊 are, uh, ex... 🍋 some extremely valuable potions 🍊 (and there's a very limited 🍋 number of these in the game) 🍊 and those are the [only] way that 🍋 you can replenish your health. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also [various] quest items 🍋 required to move the game forward. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's also items such as 🍋 boards, ropes, and so on 🍊 which are needed to 🍋 get past obstacles. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, you never know 🍋 what you're going to encounter 🍊 as you make your way 🍋 through the mansion 🍊 so it's never obvious what 🍋 items you should have with you 🍊 at any time, thus often 🍋 requiring, uh, some backtracking. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though some items are 🍋 very conveniently placed 🍊 right before the place 🍋 that you're actually 🍋 going to need to use them. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So the other interesting 🍋 thing about "Sweet Home" 🍊 is it's the second and 🍋 final Capcom game 🍊 that must have come out of 🍋 some sort of partnership 🍊 with, uh, Toho and the 🍋 director, Juzo Itami. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first, of course, being the 🍋 'Taxing Woman' game from September. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now "Sweet Home" (the movie) 🍋 hit theaters in January 1989 🍊 and was released on V.H.S. 🍋 and LaserDisc, later that year. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Fujiwara said he was 🍋 allowed to visit the set 🍊 while "Sweet Home" 🍋 was being filmed 🍊 in order to get 🍋 ideas for the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, while Itami produced 🍋 "Sweet Home" the movie 🍊 he didn't actually direct it, 🍊 giving the job to a young 🍋 director named Kiyoshi Kurosawa 🍊 (who would, of course, later 🍋 find fame for his horror movies 🍊 such as "The Cure" and "Pulse" 🍊 before obtaining a certain 🍋 amount of respectability 🍊 in the 2000s for his more dramatic 🍋 work such as "Tokyo Sonata"). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So let's talk a bit about 🍋 "Sweet Home" the movie 🍊 and how it relates to the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] plot of the film involves 🍊 a T.V. news crew visiting 🍋 this abandoned mansion 🍊 in order to investigate stories of, 🍋 uh, the artist's final piece of work 🍊 - a fresco painted on 🍋 a wall inside the mansion. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The crew includes: 🍊 Kazuo (who apparently 🍋 is managing the production), 🍊 his potential love interest, Akiko 🍊 (played by Itami's wife, 🍋 Nobuko Miyamoto, 🍊 who is also the, uh, 🍋 titular 'taxing woman'); 🍊 there's also Kazuo's daughter, Emi 🍊 (who wants her widower father 🍋 to, uh, hook up with Akiko), 🍊 and then we have the sultry 🍋 somewhat diva-ish T.V. anchor, Asuka, 🍊 and the imbecilic and horny 🍋 camera operator, Taguchi. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The crew quickly finds the mural 🍋 but strange things start happening 🍊 (apparently due to Taguchi 🍋 knocking over a pile of rocks, 🍊 which served as kind of a 🍋 ward against evil spirits). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All kinds of, uh, bizarre 🍋 things start occurring; 🍊 additional creepy paintings 🍋 appear on the other walls 🍊 surrounding the original fresco. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Asuka becomes somewhat possessed 🍊 and digs up the coffin 🍋 of a disfigured baby 🍊 and brings it into the house. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The main 'monster', if you will, 🍋 in the movie 🍊 is simply a mysterious shadow 🍋 that appears and sets people on fire 🍊 - first burning off Taguchi's entire 🍋 lower half and then melting Asuka. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The local gas station attendant 🍋 is played by Itami 🍋 in an absurd fake beard 🍊 and he tells that, uh, 🍋 Mamiya's wife went insane 🍊 when their young child crawled 🍋 inside a furnace and burned to death. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then she went 🍋 on a kidnapping spree, 🍊 murdering children from the area 🍋 by tossing them into the furnace 🍊 - so her own child would have 🍋 playmates in heaven or something. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The second half of the movie 🍋 mostly involves Akiko, Kazuo, 🍋 and Itami's character 🍊 trying to rescue Emi from 🍋 the ghost of Mamiya's wife. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The finale involves a 🍋 confrontation with the ghost 🍊 who is actually a, uh, 🍋 [pretty] well done 🍋 animatronic puppet in this case. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now "Sweet Home" is not a good 🍋 movie, by anyone's standards. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a bit too long; 🍋 the characters are broad cliches. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The house is not very well designed; 🍊 I mean, you really get no idea 🍋 of the layout of the place. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And despite being, 🍋 um, sort of, like, 🍊 an almost castle-like 🍋 multi-level structure 🍊 all we ever see are just 🍊 a series of generic-looking hallways 🍋 and mostly indistinguishable rooms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The [only] two areas 🍋 that have any character 🍊 are the mural room 🍋 and the basement 🍊 and whatever room has this 🍋 Art Nouveau piece of decor 🍊 which we see multiple times. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The movie looks and feels [pretty] 🍋 cheap (almost like a T.V. movie) 🍊 aside from the special effects 🍋 sequences which are [pretty] impressive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The lighting is done in what I 🍋 call a 1980s music video-style. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Meaning there's all these 🍋 unknown light sources 🍊 casting ornate shadows 🍋 all over everything, 🍊 almost as if every room in the castle 🍋 has, like, giant skylight windows, 🍊 which (based on, you know, 🍋 the views that we get of it 🍋 from the outside) 🍊 simply does not appear 🍋 to be the case. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, to further confuse matters, 🍊 the version available 🍋 on tape and LaserDisc 🍊 is not the same as 🍋 what played in theaters, 🍊 as Itami was supposedly not 🍋 satisfied with Kurosawa's results 🍊 and re-filmed a number of sequences 🍋 and changed the ending. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It would probably not be 🍋 remembered at all today 🍊 except as a curio in the 🍋 filmography of Kurosawa and Itami, 🍊 were it not for the game's 🍋 connection to "Resident Evil". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's never even been released 🍋 after the LaserDisc came out in 1989 🍊 so you just can't go to Netflix or 🍋 Amazon if you want to see a copy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for the game, 🍋 it takes the basic premise 🍊 ('five people in a house haunted by 🍋 the ghost of lady whose kid died') 🍊 but, other than that, 🍋 it's [pretty] much entirely 🍋 different from the movie's plot. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The movie kills off two of the 🍋 five characters [pretty] quickly, 🍊 which the game doesn't do unless 🍋 they accidentally get killed in combat. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object of 🍋 "Sweet Home" the game 🍊 is mostly just to 🍋 get out of the house 🍊 by making your way through this, 🍋 uh, sort of, huge sprawling complex. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the movie the characters don't 🍋 really get trapped in the house 🍊 and could, in theory, 🍋 have left at any time 🍊 (though there is a subplot about 🍋 their jeep breaking down, uh, 🍊 which somewhat delays their leaving). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, while the frescoes seem to 🍊 indicate that something weird 🍋 and creepy had happened, 🍊 they are [pretty] much forgotten 🍋 after the first 20 minutes or so. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the game, you keep finding 🍋 frescoes throughout the mansion 🍊 that give you various clues, 🍊 so the frescoes play a bigger part 🍋 in the game than they do in the movie. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first major sub-goal 🍋 you have in "Sweet Home" 🍊 is to locate the generator 🍊 so that you can restore 🍋 power to the mansion 🍊 (thus turning the lights back on). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You do eventually find it, 🍊 housed in a rather video gamey🍋 -looking metal building, 🍊 but you also need to 🍋 locate the gasoline. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the movie, there's also a 🍋 generator that needs to be turned on 🍊 but this happens at 🍋 the very beginning 🍊 and is a [pretty] uneventful scene. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Likewise, a light fixture 🍋 falls in the movie at one point, 🍊 which, in the game, gets 🍋 turned into a rec... 🍋 recurring sort of quick time event 🍊 in which you have to quickly press 🍋 a button in order to avoid some 🍋 object hitting you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Some of the characters' special 🍋 items have analogs in the film. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Taguchi does operate a camera 🍋 to film the proceedings 🍊 and a vacuum cleaner is used to 🍋 uncover the fresco in one scene 🍊 but it's not used by Asuka. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Akiko does bandage Kazuo's hand 🍋 at one point 🍊 (which might correspond to her being 🍋 the healing character in the game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there is a key 🍋 (which fails to open the door) 🍊 but it has no connection to Emi. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the lighter, 🍋 as far as I can recall, 🍊 doesn't come into play 🍋 in the film at all. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One of the game's primary 🍋 appealing factors is the enemies - 🍊 most of which are excellently drawn 🍋 and quite creepy and gruesome. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 None of them make any appearance 🍋 in the film, where the evil spirit 🍊 (perhaps for budgetary reasons) 🍊 takes the form of an actual shadow 🍋 just crawling across the walls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But in the game you definitely 🍋 get a "Resident Evil" vibe 🍋 from some of the monsters 🍊 (such as the zombie dogs that 🍋 roam around near the generator). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game gives you hints about 🍋 the evil doings in the house 🍊 in the form of notes, diary entries, 🍋 uh, skeletons, talking dolls, 🍊 and (oddly) what appear to be 🍋 bloodied but still-living people 🍊 just, sort of, lying around 🍋 in the hallways. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the movie, 🍊 Itami's character simply explains 🍋 the whole deal about the dead wife 🍊 but here you don't get the 🍋 whole story until the very end. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A slide projector plays an important 🍋 part in the game at the very end, 🍊 but it also appears in the movie 🍋 near the very beginning 🍊 and is of very little consequence. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, again, there's a lot 🍋 of elements for the movie 🍊 that kind of get rejiggered into 🍋 the game in very different ways. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Almost all the various 🍋 hazards found in the house 🍊 (such as sticky floors, bats, 🍋 weird purple slime, 🍊 rubble that needs to be 🍋 smashed with a mallet, 🍊 suits of armor that attack you, 🍋 giant holes in the floor 🍊 that you crossed 🍋 using a wooden board) 🍊 - [pretty] much none of these 🍋 appear in the film at all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, in the end, 🍊 Capcom's "Sweet Home" 🍋 is virtually a new creation 🍊 - totally separate from the film. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned, earlier, it's 🍋 generally considered to be an R.P.G.. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You do have Hit Points or 🍋 'Life', as it's called here. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are levels and you Level Up 🍋 after getting enough Experience 🍊 but there aren't any 🍋 visible Experience Points 🍊 except when you've won a battle 🍊 that shows you how many 🍋 points you obtained. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you can't really tell how 🍋 close you are to Leveling Up 🍊 just by looking at 🍋 your character stats. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You do have a visible 🍋 'Attack' stat 🍊 and then you have 🍋 something called 'Pray' 🍊 which is a rather odd sort of 🍋 magic that has several uses. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In terms of equipment 🍊 you can equip a Weapon 🍋 but no Armor or Accessories. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are no sorts of 🍋 Elemental affinities or anything 🍊 (though silver weapons work 🍋 better against ghosts and such). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly, most of the items 🍋 can be used in battle 🍊 to do damage to certain enemies 🍊 but it's not always clear 🍋 which enemies they're useful for. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So you can experiment with various 🍋 Items and learn, for example, 🍊 that the lighter can be used on, 🍋 say, the maggots to do damage 🍊 - but on most other enemies 🍋 it has no effect at all. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are no Shops or Inns 🍋 or even any real N.P.C.s, 🍊 other than the 🍋 gas station attendant 🍊 who appears a bit 🍋 later in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So it's an R.P.G. 🍊 that's kind of pared down 🍋 to the absolute essentials. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, the game is mostly 🍋 about exploring the house, 🍊 collecting items, 🍋 and fighting random battles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I suppose you could call it 🍋 an R.P.G. that takes place 🍊 entirely inside a 🍋 very large dungeon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The emphasis on environmental 🍋 hazards and basic puzzle solving 🍊 make it feel, sort of, like it's 🍋 half R.P.G. and half adventure game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now the most striking way 🍊 in which this deviates from 🍋 the standard R.P.G. formula 🍊 is that characters cannot be 🍋 revived ever once they die 🍊 (and the death scene 🍋 is brutally gruesome!). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, in order to make the game 🍋 beatable after a character dies, 🍊 there is a replacement item 🍋 somewhere in the house 🍊 for every special item. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, for example, if Emi dies 🍋 you'll need to find the wire 🍊 which opens doors 🍋 just like Emi's key. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, for example, 🍊 the pills do the same 🍋 thing as Akiko's remedy 🍊 (you know, cures you of the 🍋 enemy-inflicted statuses, 🍋 such as poison). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Overall "Sweet Home" is 🍋 [pretty] tough and unforgiving. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While it's a quality-made game, I 🍋 can't say actually liked playing it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's the most stripped-down 🍋 R.P.G. possible. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's really just 🍋 walk-into-a-series-of-rooms 🍋 and fighting monsters. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It almost boils down to being 🍋 an inventory-management game, 🍊 as you're always needing to 🍋 drop items to pick up new items 🍊 or go back later 🍋 and then find items 🍊 that you weren't able 🍋 to carry earlier. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The system of having 🍋 two separate parties 🍊 means that you constantly 🍋 have to switch back and forth 🍊 between the two so they 🍋 don't get too far separated. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eh... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though there is a Call function, 🍋 uh, 🍊 which is where, when 🍋 one team goes into battle 🍊 you can switch to the other team 🍋 and then join the battle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is highly recommended 🍋 because this will give all 🍊 the members in the battle 🍋 experience points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But overall I just felt like 🍋 too much time was spent 🍊 fiddling around in menus - 🍋 more so than in most R.P.G.s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's really no 🍋 characterization other than 🍊 I suppose at the very beginning 🍋 when there's a few lines of dialogue. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And every place in the mansion 🍋 has this sort of samey feel to it 🍊 other than a few places 🍊 (such as, like, uh, 🍋 there's a period 🍊 where you go outside and 🍋 explore around the lake). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Other than that, 🍊 it's mostly just a series 🍋 of halls and rooms. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, by all means, 🍊 take advantage of the 🍋 new fan translation 🍊 and try "Sweet Home" 🍋 for yourself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of people love this 🍋 game to absolute pieces. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And if you are a "Resident Evil" 🍋 fan you owe it to yourself 🍊 to check out that 🍋 game's ancestor. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Top Gun: Dual Fighters 🇯🇵 // Top Gun: The Second Mission 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 15 🇯🇵 // 1990 January [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Geez! 🍊 How many episodes has it been 🍋 since we've seen a Konami game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [The] last one was, 🍋 perhaps, "Twinbee 3"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately the game we have here 🍋 today is a piece of hot garbage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I speak, of course, of 🍋 "Top Gun: Dual Fighters". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, the intro is cool, at least; 🍊 and the music in 🍋 "Top Gun: Dual Fighters" 🍋 is freaking on point. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Konami had an enormously talented 🍋 musical staff at this time 🍊 and I'd say the music is 🍋 probably the main thing 🍋 this game has going for it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Naturally this was released 🍋 in the U.S. under the name 🍋 "Top Gun: The Second Mission". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not much, if anything, was changed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, on a purely technical level, 🍊 this is a [pretty] big 🍋 improvement over the first game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Check out this, uh, intro 🍋 sequence where your jet takes off. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Konami has made a lot of 🍋 superficial improvements 🍊 when compared to the 🍋 first "Top Gun" game 🍊 but I still do not 🍋 actually like this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now here's the 🍋 regular mission mode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a 'Versus' mode 🍊 where you can face off 🍋 against the computer opponents 🍊 or in the two-player mode 🍋 against another player. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are three missions 🍋 in the mission mode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each has you engaging 🍋 a number of enemy jets 🍊 (and some submarines, 🍋 for some reason?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At the end of each mission, 🍋 you then face down a boss. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Controls are [pretty] simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One button accelerates and the 🍋 other one fires your weapon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Pressing the B button once 🍋 or holding it down 🍊 fires your machine gun 🍊 and then tapping B twice 🍋 fires a guided missile. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In theory, the missiles will lock 🍋 on to an enemy in the reticle 🍊 but they don't always 🍋 successfully hit their target. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One nice bit in this game 🍊 is that you must select 🍋 what type of missile you want. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The better the missiles are, 🍋 the fewer you get. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess even the Air Force has a 🍋 budget, when it comes to missiles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I went with the medium missiles 🍊 which, I suppose, is a balance 🍋 between power and quantity. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now "Top Gun 2" is, I guess, 🍋 better than "Top Gun" 1. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's more variety 🍋 and, most importantly, 🍊 the landing-your-jet minigame 🍋 is not the horrible mess 🍋 that it was in the first game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just poking around online, 🍊 a number of folks seemed 🍋 to really like this game 🍊 and some game magazine 🍋 reviews really praised it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One rather weird exception was the 🍋 British magazine 'Mean Machines', 🍊 which considered it to be inferior 🍋 to the first "Top Gun" game 🍊 in just about every respect, 🍊 which is a really 🍋 weird opinion to have. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I think my issue is 🍊 I just don't like these type 🍋 of aircraft combat games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, I think 🍋 "Afterburner" is fun 🍊 but I just absolutely hated 🍋 "Top Gun: Dual Fighters" 🍊 for almost every second 🍋 I was playing it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first boss was okay, perhaps. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ah, so here's the 🍋 revised landing sequence. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Basically you just position 🍋 your sighting reticle 🍊 in the middle of 🍋 the aircraft carrier 🍊 and then you're good to go. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, much better times are 🍋 ahead for Konami, next episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So I would definitely anticipate 🍋 a really great Konami game that 🍋 we'll be looking at that time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pinball Quest 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 15 🇯🇵 // 1990 June [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The penultimate game this episode: 🍋 "Pinball Quest". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, boy! This is a weird one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously it's a pinball game, 🍊 published by Jaleco 🍋 and developed by Tose. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now let's get the normal part of 🍋 the game out of the way first. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are three 🍋 tables you can play: 🍊 Pop Pop', 'Viva Golf', 🍋 and 'Circus'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Any of these can be played 🍋 for up to four players. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They are [pretty] standard 🍋 pinball video game tables; 🍊 each has its own theme. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Pop Pop is sort of like a 🍊 '50s/U.S.A./'Happy Days'🍋 -style cultural thing going on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are bowling pins, 🍋 a girl jumping over a jukebox, 🍋 and an American flag. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can even get your ball 🍋 into that little pool table area 🍋 on the left side there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Viva Golf is, well... golf-themed 🍋 and the table resembles a golf course. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And finally we have Circus 🍋 which, aside from the circus theme, 🍊 also has a slot machine(?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe it's supposed to be more 🍋 like a Las Vegas 'Circus Circus' 🍊 kind of deal, rather than 🍋 an actual circus in a tent. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, all of this is well 🍋 and good for a pinball game 🍊 but the real meat and potatoes 🍋 comes in the form 🍊 of the R.P.G. option. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yes, that's right, 🍋 a pinball R.P.G.. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, let me get this out there, 🍋 right off the bat; 🍊 I hate this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I have more unadulterated 🍋 hatred for "Pinball Quest" 🍊 than any other game this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Which is a shame because 🍋 it's kind of a clever idea. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is not really an R.P.G. 🍊 but, um, it sort of employs 🍋 some R.P.G. elements, I guess. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the Japanese 🍋 version came in, like, 🍊 a rather non-standard-looking 🍋 FamiCom box, 🍊 as Jaleco sometimes did do. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the cartridge was 🍋 kind of oddly-shaped 🍊 (though I'm not really sure why). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This did get a U.S. release 🍋 in summer 1990 🍊 [in] which the cartoon 🍋 box art was replaced 🍊 by sort of slightly 🍋 more metal artwork, 🍊 featuring The Grim Reaper 🍋 inside a pinball. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, rather than 🍋 using the term 'R.P.G.', 🍊 the U.S. box calls "Pinball Quest" 🍊 a quote-unquote "multi-screen 🍋 fantasy in pinball format" 🍊 (which is probably technically 🍋 more accurate than 'R.P.G.'). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Each level is basically a two screen 🍋 table with an enemy at the top. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Often there are smaller enemies 🍊 hanging around on the 🍋 upper screen as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They just sort of get in your way. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It generally requires that 🍊 you first get the ball into 🍋 the upper half of the table 🍊 and then you need to hit 🍋 the boss enemy with the ball 🍊 a bunch of times 🍋 until you kill him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 On the very first level 🍋 the boss drops a key 🍊 which is used to open 🍋 the castle door. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once inside the castle, you will 🍋 face a series of similar bosses 🍊 but there's also actually 🍋 a shop in between tables 🍊 where you can buy improved 🍋 flippers and stoppers. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now there are stoppers 🍋 that will disappear 🍊 after being hit 🍋 by a ball [only] once 🍊 as well as stoppers that 🍋 can take multiple hits. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's flippers that cause the 🍋 ball to do more damage to enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, rather than buying, 🍋 you can also select Steal, 🍊 which has a chance of you 🍋 walking out of the shop 🍋 with some random items. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But what usually happens 🍊 is you simply get beat up 🍋 by the shopkeeper 🍊 and lose half your money. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I was never able to 🍋 successfully steal 🍊 even once when playing this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned, I really 🍋 hated "Pinball Quest". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I'm not really into 🍋 pinball video games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I understand the appeal 🍋 of pinball tables 🍊 but a lot of that appeal to me 🍊 lies in the actual 🍋 physicality of the table. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You know - the various bumpers, 🍋 seeing the ball whizz around. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A 2D simulation of 🍋 a pinball table 🍊 played on the 🍋 Nintendo Entertainment System 🍊 doesn't really sound 🍋 that exciting to me. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Regardless I found "Pinball Quest" 🍋 to be an unusually frustrating game 🍊 because it has very concrete goals 🍊 and you can make temporary 🍋 progress towards those goals 🍊 but there is no... really no 🍋 permanent progress in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, in a regular R.P.G., 🍋 once you earn experience points, 🍊 or level up, or learn new skills - 🍋 that's a form of permanent progress. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You don't lose Experience Points 🍋 or de-Level if you make mistakes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Pinball Quest", if your 🍋 ball drops into the drain 🍊 you will automatically 🍋 exit that table 🍊 and the door to the table 🍋 will then be locked. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You then need to go back one stage 🍋 and replay the prior table. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Beating that table will then let 🍋 you back into the table that 🍋 originally booted you out earlier. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And remember, 🍋 just losing one ball 🍊 will cause you to get 🍋 kicked off the table. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So to beat the game 🍊 you essentially have to 🍋 play through every level 🍊 consecutively without 🍋 making a single mistake. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's actually [pretty] 🍋 easy to lose the ball, 🍊 just based on the way 🍋 the tables are designed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, playing this has a real 🍊 one-step-forward 🍋 two-steps-backward feel to it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's quite easy to get, 🍋 like, halfway through it, 🍊 make a few mistakes, [and] 🍊 end up right back at the 🍋 very beginning of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You have an infinite 🍋 number of lives 🍊 so it seems like you could 🍋 spend virtually an eternity 🍊 bouncing around between 🍋 the various game levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, of course, I understand that 🍋 losing balls is easy in this game, 🍊 so that the game will 🍋 take longer to beat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, in theory, 🍊 I think the way to approach this 🍋 might be to keep playing, 🍊 sort of, like, 🍊 the tame... same tables 🍋 over and over again 🍊 until you can start to 🍋 afford the expensive upgrades, 🍊 which will then lessen the 🍋 chance of losing a ball. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But for me personally, 🍋 the game's pattern of 🍊 making progress and then losing 🍋 (sometimes) all that progress 🍊 and having to play through 🍋 the same table that you 🍋 just beat a minute ago 🍊 became incredibly 🍋 infuriating after a while. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, if you really 🍋 enjoy pinball video games, 🍊 maybe you'll actually like this, 🍊 but I grew to absolutely hate 🍋 "Pinball Quest" very quickly. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Flipull 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ Tin Cans Puerto Rican Remix ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 December 15 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Daiei Seisakusho
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 All good things must come to an 🍋 end and that includes this episode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Our last game today is "Flipull". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It is the '90s and 🍋 there is time for 🍊 "Flipull" 🍋 'the exciting cube game' 🍊 (as opposed to all those 🍋 other boring cube games). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's two modes: 🍋 'Normal' and 'Advance'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Normal' is the more 🍋 spontaneous play mode 🍊 and 'Advance' is a bit more 🍋 like a strategy mode, I guess. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You move that little guy 🍋 up and down on the ladder 🍊 to choose where you 🍋 wanna throw your block. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can throw it either at the 🍋 blocks along the right side 🍊 of the block pile or 🍋 along the top side. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to throw your 🍋 block at a matching block. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Doing so will eliminate 🍋 any matching blocks 🍊 until it hits the first 🍋 non-matching block 🍊 which will then be replaced 🍋 by the block you just threw. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you get a situation where you 🍋 end up getting back a block 🍊 that can't be thrown because 🍋 there's no matching blocks 🍊 then you will get a 🍋 quote-unquote "Miss". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then the worthless block 🍋 you're stuck with 🍊 will be replaced by 🍋 a wildcard-type block 🍊 which will automatically 🍋 transform to a match 🍊 for whatever block you throw it at. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But you [only] get three 🍋 of these per level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it's important to almost 🍋 always be thinking a little ahead 🍊 so you don't end up with 🍋 a block that can't be used. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can die if you run out of time 🍊 or use all three of 🍋 your special blocks 🍊 and then get stuck with a Miss. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Flipull" began life 🍋 as a Taito arcade game, 🍊 released in the U.S. 🍋 under the name "Plotting" 🍊 which makes, uh, exactly as much 🍋 sense as, uh, the name "Flipull". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The arcade version wasn't 🍋 exactly a technological-marvel 🍊 so it wasn't too much of a challenge 🍋 to fit this thing on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However the same can't 🍋 really be said about 🍊 the Game Boy version from 1990 🍊 which even got a U.S. release 🍋 under the original name "Flipull". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'One of the gnarliest brain games 🍋 around', as the box said. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The lack of color 🍋 and low resolution 🍊 meant the blocks had 🍋 to be redesigned. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, for example, the 🍋 Taito logo was lost. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the blocks aren't 🍋 quite as distinguishable 🍊 as they were in 🍋 the color versions. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was also released on 🍋 various computer platforms 🍊 but all of these went 🍋 under the name "Plotting". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, as far as I know, 🍊 the Game Boy version was 🍋 the [only] Western release 🍊 to use the original 🍋 name of "Flipull". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As you proceed, later stages 🍋 will have larger piles of blocks 🍊 and, uh, different 🍋 icons on the blocks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, for the 'Advance' mode, 🍋 here's where it gets a bit trickier. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There is no timer here 🍊 but the blocks are 🍋 arranged in a way 🍊 so that you really have to use 🍋 them in a very specific order 🍊 - otherwise you'll get stuck 🍋 in an unwinnable situation. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have no wildcard blocks, 🍊 so making even one mistake 🍋 is an instant life lost. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, rather than firing off blocks 🍋 in an improvised fashion, 🍊 you need to sort of take a minute 🍋 to plot out your plan of attack. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Flipull" is a 🍋 surprisingly pleasant game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Even though the mechanics 🍋 are [pretty] unusual 🍊 it [only] takes a minute to pick up 🍊 and is actually [pretty] intuitive 🍋 once you get the hang of it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, really, "Flipull" is 🍋 one of the totally unoffensive 🍋 games this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 52 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Another 15 games down and we are 🍋 so close to being done with 1989 - 🍊 just two more episodes 🍋 and we'll be on to 1990. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the best game this episode? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well I almost feel obligated 🍋 to give it to "Sweet Home". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It is such an original 🍋 game in so many ways 🍊 that I almost feel bad 🍋 I didn't like it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So maybe "Sweet Home" and "Abadox" 🍋 can share the prize 🍊 ("Abadox" being my personal 🍋 favorite, this time around). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Worst game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I could say "Pinball Quest", 🍋 which is probably 🍊 (along with "Top Gun") 🍋 the game that I hated the most. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yet "Pinball Quest" is 🍋 at least a unique idea. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And "Top Gun" is 🍋 [pretty] well-liked 🍊 by folks who enjoy 🍋 console air-combat games 🍊 and they did improve 🍋 on the landing minigame. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So..., I guess, I'll say 🍋 "Taito Chase H.Q.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's just no point in 🍋 porting this to an 8-bit system. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It just doesn't work! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a mere shadow 🍋 of the arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A 16-bit port would 🍋 work better, I'm sure, 🍊 but this one was [pretty] bad. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next time, well... 🍊 there's good news and 🍋 there's bad news. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The bad news: ooh... I hope you 🍋 like Baseball Games, first of all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, there's some terrible 🍋 junk from the likes of Acclaim 🍊 and a famously-hated 🍋 licensed title from L.J.N. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the good news - 🍊 it's one of the absolute best 🍋 action platformer-type N.E.S. games 🍊 from good old reliable Konami. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I hope to get this new episode 🍋 out in a reasonable time period. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I've also got some 🍋 bonus content coming up, 🍊 that I sort of had 🍋 lying around for a while. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, over on the 🍋 'Dr. Sparkle After Dark' channel, 🍊 we'll be covering the weird 🍋 indie horror movie, "Pigs". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, keep your eyes peeled 🍊 and I hope you have a 🍋 very happy Halloween. 🍇🍌
