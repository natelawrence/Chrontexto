👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 24 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Chrontendo' is back and it's the holiday season of 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, we've finally reached November. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., the big news is a toy company decided to take the plunge into console gaming, and releasing three games based on movies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thus, the flood of U.S. licensed Nintendo games begins. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Japan, the big game this time is probably the FamiCom port of the largest selling Japanese Computer Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was published by Hudson, who also have a rather unusual surprise in store this time around. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also we have the promised follow-up to the 1987 Computer Game Round-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This time we're taking a look at the big Arcade video games from 1987. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But first, let's start off with some Arcade ports. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Joust 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 30 🇯🇵 // 1988 October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Williams | HAL 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL 🇯🇵 // HAL America 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They've got a big five games released at the very end of October, so let's get this one out of the way first. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Joust" is the third and final of HAL's series of ports of old U.S. Arcade Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again the same music and that weird copyright to Atari. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In case anyone out there doesn't know "Joust", it was a very successful 1982 Arcade Game from Midway. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In it you control an armored knight, mounted on flying ostrich. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You attempt to collide with the other knights, but you must do so at a higher elevation to win the fight. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your opponent's ostrich will then drop an egg, which you must collect; otherwise the knight will rehatch after a minute. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For those of you with excellent memories, you might remember, uh, Nintendo's game "Balloon Fight" covered way back in "Chrontendo ... 2". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was [pretty] clearly based on "Joust". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well as far as home versions go, HAL's "Joust" ain't that hot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Joust" is very much based around the game's physics (with your ostrich having weight and momentum). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Learning to control and maneuver your ostrich is the key thing to beating your opponents. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But everything seems a little off, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One very odd thing is the way your bird, like, bounces around the platforms (like they were pinball bumpers or something). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just as with "Millipede" and "Defender", the title screen and the character sprites have been altered for the U.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, I'm at a complete loss why (unless HAL simply felt the need to add a bit more detail to the graphics). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original "Joust" is a cool game, so it's too bad they weren't able to pull this off a little better. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, with that out of the way, let's move on to a better Arcade port. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Bubble Bobble 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 30 🇯🇵 // 1988 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's another F.D.S. title from Taito and also an Arcade port (much like August's "Kiki KaiKai"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Today, however, we have "Bubble Bobble" - a port of Taito's Arcade Game of much more recent vintage than "Joust". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Bubble Bobble" is, sort of, a follow-up to the game, uh, "Chack'n Pop" (the FamiCom port of which we covered back in "Chrontendo ... 3"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like it's nostalgia week, here at 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your dragon character, uh, made his first appearance in that game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Kiki KaiKai", "Bubble Bobble"... (hmm... I sense, sort of, a pattern in Taito's names for these games) ...is a very straightforward port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The game has not been given any, sort of, like R.P.G. makeover or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite being a relatively modern game (from 1986) "Bubble Bobble" is a very, sort of, deliberately old-fashioned, sort of, game, hearkening back to the kind of games that were popular, back when the FamiCom was first released. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It falls into the, sort of, "Dig Dug"/"Bomberman"-style of game, where your character attempts to kill enemies, using some sort of unique method of execution. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you've cleared the screen of enemies, you're on to the next screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In "Bubble Bobble"'s case, rather than air pumps or bombs, it's (well, uh) bubbles, obviously. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You blow bubbles at the monsters, which will then become trapped in the bubbles and slowly float upwards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You must then pop the bubble, sending the monsters to their doom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Various bonus items appear and from time to time; well, actually, that's [pretty] much all there really is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taito's, uh, port was also released in the U.S. on a cartridge and is, uh, still a [pretty] much perfect conversion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It looks almost exactly like the original Arcade Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By 1986 standards, the Arcade "Bubble Bobble" had very simple graphics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it really could have been released in 1983 and, you know, looked about the same. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, as a result of the game's, sort of, you know, lack of being a cutting-edge graphical kind of game, the FamiCom was able to reproduce it with rather, uh, [only] an insignificant loss of detail. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A few things have been changed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... But "Bubble Bobble" was one of the very few, sort of, perfect Arcade conversions coming out this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mentioned the Sega Master System's "Wonder Boy" as being one of the very rare examples of a dead-on Arcade Port. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Bubble Bobble" is long (over 100 levels)! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And some are actually very hard (like that we [only] saw a second Gold all the enemies firing, like, lasers down at you). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to get to the top of the screen (which is really tough)! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At times, you'll have to execute some clever moves (for example, blowing a bubble and then jumping on it, in order to get to higher levels). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the very end, there is a boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 His name is actually (get this) Super Drunk and he throws bottles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately I'm not really good enough at bubble ball to actually defeat him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Overall "Bubble Bobble" is very accurate part of a fun and fondly-remembered Arcade classic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really, sort of, one of the last of the old-school style Arcade Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's hard to imagine how Taito could screw this, uh, one up too badly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it is nice that they actually put a lot of effort into this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 FamiCom Grand Prix F1 Race 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Man! HAL makes a [pretty] bad showing this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As we've seen, Nintendo is now outsourcing most of its Sports Games to HAL, with one big exception (which we'll discuss later, this episode). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And now, here we have another HAL-developed game from Nintendo: "FamiCom Grand Prix F1 Race". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, this is probably the least playable Racing Game we've seen for the system so far. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "FamiCom Grand Prix..." is I suppose a follow-up to the system's first Racing Game, "F1 Race" from 1984. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is a, uh, sort of, a bit of a Racing Simulation added into this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You use the money to buy better and better cars. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, you, uh -- to get money you have to win races. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you start by buying your car (and there's a few other options as well). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This being an F.D.S. game, you can actually save your progress. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, upon starting a race, you need to select which cars do you want to drive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is actually a [pretty] forward-thinking idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nowadays, Racing Games are like doing a whole garage full of vehicles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But in 1987 this is not something you saw in other console Racing Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is a total of four tracks in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's rather unfortunate that this game was released so quickly after Square's "Rad Racer", since, uh, "FamiCom Grand Prix..." suffers in comparison. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Surprisingly it uses a top-down perspective, rather than the more contemporary 3D viewpoint favored by a lot of other games like "Rad Racer" and even the 1984 "F1 Race". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This does seem like kind of an odd decision, since top-down Racing Games tend to be associated with early Arcade Racing Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Post-"Pole Position", top-down Racing Games started falling out of favor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though we will occasionally see a game with isometric perspective, like Rare's "R.C. Pro-Am" or "Rock 'n' Roll Racing". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Regardless, this does give the game, sort of, an old-fashioned feel to it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [The] actual gameplay is extremely simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have two buttons: one to accelerate in low gear and the other for high gear; there's no brake. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You use your D-Pad to steer the car. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Handling is a bit shaky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much like, uh, "Slalom", the car's control, uh, feels -- fells very digital. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, your car can [only] point in a limited number of directions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is, if you touch the -- Right on the D-Pad, your car will suddenly turn a set number of degrees. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thus, you can't control your vehicle very precisely. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, the tracks [only] run straight up and down, or sideways, or diagonally at 45 degree angles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, trying to cleanly round corners or recover from an error can be [pretty] tricky, due to the lack of simply being able to fine tune your turns. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another aspect of the game is the damage that your car takes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whenever you hit something or whenever you drive on the grass (or just drive much at all, quite frankly) your tires will slowly take damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once your tires' strength have gone down to zero, you will start skidding and sliding all over the place and your car will become impossible to control. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, you will need to definitely get into the, uh, pit and have tires and the car repaired. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One other interesting thing: 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 There was a contest based around this game (kind of like that earlier a Golf Game). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Folks with good scores could get a limited edition "F1 Grand Prix" Game and Watch game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's too bad this game is not better. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Interestingly, in the U.S., Nintendo decided to skip this game and actually released "Rad Racer" themselves. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Composer 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Musical Plan 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tokyo Shoseki 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We now have two games up from the Japanese book and magazine publisher, Tokyo Shoseki today, "Family Composer" and "Romancia". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll start with the less interesting of the two. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Presumably Musical Plan is the company that developed this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Tokyo Shoseki is one company that seems to have no fear about repeating itself, since this is the second virtual music studio title they've released. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first was "Ikinari Musician" back in March of '87; that game was also copywritten to Musical Plan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know if you remember "Ikinari Musician". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (I barely do myself.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it had this little rabbit theme going on - little dancing rabbits would appear in spots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess "Family Composer"'s a more serious version of the earlier release. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It works somewhat like a real synthesizer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can select a rhythm, add music, record, playback, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The pencil tool allows you to note the score - and then you can listen to it being played. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is, sort of, like a cool kind of thing to, sort of, fool around with. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, just like I said about "Ikinari Musician", someone with musical talent might have a good time with this and be able to create something interesting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, for folks like me, it's just gonna have to be a toy that sort of makes some noise. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there are a couple different modes, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... This one, right here, I can't quite seem to figure out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have your little little tape player that you can, sort of, speed up and slow things down. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I have not yet been able to actually determine what this is supposed to do. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Romancia 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 October 30 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nihon Falcom | Compile 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tokyo Shoseki 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our second Tokyo Shoseki game is a little different. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, it's *completely* different! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Incredibly, it's a port of Nihon Falcon's Computer Game, "Dragon Slayer" Jr.: Romancia". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right, we've seen the 'Dragon Slayer' series before, with "Dragon Slayer" IV" (a.k.a. "Legacy of the Wizard") that horribly cruel game from Namco, in which your little family explored an absurdly large and confusing castle, looking for... something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, we saw a bit of "Romancia" back then. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was originally released in 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is the M.S.X. 1 version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes called an R.P.G., it's really more of a proto-R.P.G. - sort of, a side-scrolling Hack-'n'-Slash in which you do a lot of fetch quests. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it was, of course, the third in the 'Dragon Slayer' series (number two being "Xanadu"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It's] not exactly a very good-looking game, but tolerable, I suppose, by those early M.S.X. standards. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just by comparison, here's the M.S.X. 2 version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess is the nice way to, sort of, compare the capabilities Between the two generations of M.S.X. computers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, the game is not exactly nice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a 30 minute time limit and no way to save your game or continue. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Trial and error factor very heavily into gameplay. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game starts you off exploring this rather large village. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But even here, you're not exactly completely safe of danger, and you can't really fool around too much. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, if you talk to this one guy who's sitting on a cloud, he'll actually kill you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, that's very nice. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, naturally, for the FamiCom version they have changed it around a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Now, first of all, we're going to be seeing the unofficial English translation from DVD translations.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the first thing to note is that a completely new beginning has been added. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, by the way, the FamiCom version was ported by none other than our good buddies at Compile. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, they decided to stay true to the philosophy of the original and made a game that sort of hates you and wants you to fail. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this new opening sequence you are bombarded with enemies that are almost impossible to hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And flying creatures that go round unreachable above your head and then dive bomb you directly from an angle your sword cannot reach. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you move out of their way, they then dive beneath you and then come back up and hit you from underneath. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, they attack in groups. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They sometimes drop health refills in the form of, like, a little teeny tiny heart. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you accidentally hit the heart with your sword, it vanishes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's hard to avoid hitting the hearts while you're fighting enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Basically, you have to kill a whole bunch of those. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you'll get some kind of magic stone that will allow you to enter this next little cave. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A few minute -- minutes of this and you get to the first boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] not sure what exactly that guy is throwing at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] looks like wedges of cheese or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's not that tough, as long as you've saved your long-range projectile swords. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can just stand at one side and just fire swords at him forever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, if you've used up all your swords, he's gonna be [pretty] darn tough. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, after him, you're gonna be at the beginning of the original game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, to give you an idea of Nihon Falcon's intentions, the King is in the castle behind a wall with a hidden door. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Yep! The very first thing you encounter is an invisible door.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean "Dragon Quest" started you standing right off next to the King, but here, 'Nope!', you have to start looking for hidden stuff immediately. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the town is cursed, and everyone is ill, and the exit blocked (naturally). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In order to leave, you'll need to go on all sorts of little fetch quests and find various hidden items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to do things like press the, uh, levers at the bottom of that lake to get a key. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You find some hidden areas with helpful items, and then you get medicine from a priest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course you can [only] carry one flask of medicine at a time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you'll want to heal everyone, in order to get some helpful items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you'll need to do a lot of walking from one end of, uh, town to the other. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [The] first thing to do is to jump the medicine the well and cure the village's water. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's essentially what the entire game is: finding a ton of items and figuring out how to use them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I certainly hope the original Japanese instruction manual is *huge* since none of the items have any, sort of, in-game description. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You find rings, crosses, robes, scrolls (all of which come to no -- with absolutely no hint as to what they're actually for). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Romancia" is basically, sort of, like a smaller version of "Legacy of Wizard". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah, and there is this guy again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, talk to him, and he'll, uh, send you to Heaven (in other words, kill you). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [That's] not really fair for a game with no saves or continues. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later there is a way to get to Heaven without dying, but no one in the game is going to tell you that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mostly, "Romancia" is all about sadism. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Having moved on to the next town, uh, you come across a canyon you can't jump across. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But luckily there is a, uh, rather invisible tunnel. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and here I'm actually, uh, going to Heaven the correct way (not by dying). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even on the way to Heaven, things attack you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much of what "Romancia" is seems to be, sort of, pointlessly obscure and repetitive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, there also are some cool moments (like going to Heaven - where your character gets those little, sort of, angel wings and a halo). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And at some point I picked up a scroll which is cursed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, a guy in Heaven can remove the curse (sort of) and then you'll need to use that scroll to get past a roadblock, later in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Romancia" is actually quite good at stopping your progress until you find some particular object. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Furthermore, the game world is too small and requires too much running back and forth over the same stretch of land. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Prince Fan Freddy, uh, controls sluggishly and has awful pre-"...Mario..." jumping controls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 His toward has virtually no reach, so combat's a pain. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are all issues you might expect from a Japanese Computer Game of "Romancia"'s vintage, but you would hope the FamiCom port would now offer some sort of improvements. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, Compile failed to make this game any more playable. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, we have another game that succeeds where "Romancia" failed. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎆 Introduction to Chronturbo ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned some episodes ago, Hudson Soft had been developing the new chipset for use in a video game console - one much more powerful than the chips powering the FamiCom or the Sega Master System. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hudson partnered with N.E.C., the huge Japanese electric Company. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These were the guys who also made the P.C.-88 and P.C.-98 computers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then on October 30, a bombshell hit the Japanese Computer Game scene with the release of the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This new console would officially kick off the next generation of home video game machines. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, in essence, the 16-bit era had begun, which is odd since many folks consider the P.C. Engine (and its U.S. counterpart, the TurboGrafx-16) to technically be 8-bit machines. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, that didn't really matter once you turned the thing on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first set of games released by Hudson were not that impressive gameplay-wise. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, man! The graphics demonstrated the hardware's awesome capabilities. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "The "Kung-Fu" (known as "China Warrior" in the U.S.) featured absurdly huge detailed sprites (amazing for the time)! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The P.C. Engine was quite successful in Japan, but oddly this really didn't sour Hudson's relationship with Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They continue to release games for both consoles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As promised, we will be launching a sister series dedicated the console, 'Chronturbo'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The P.C. Engine is a great system and has many hidden gems and oddities, so I'm [pretty] excited. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Expect the first episode sometime in the near future. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Punch-Out!! 🇯🇵 // Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "3030" ♪ by Deltron 3030

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November 21 🇯🇵 // 1987 October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, kids, before we move on to November, we've got one little last game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! It's one of the all time favorite from back in the day, "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What do we even say about this game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's one that needs no introduction, I suppose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The plot, as it exists, is quite simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Vertically challenged boxer, Little Mac, must beat a series of other fighters, in order to take the World Championship. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And playing the role of Little Mac... it's you! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose that's a rather clumsy way of describing the process by which the player puts himself into a character of a videogame protagonist. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I've mentioned earlier, the opening fanfare music has also been used in HAL's recent ports of old Arcade Games, such as "Joust". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 HAL worked on a number of Nintendo Sports titles, but "Punch-Out" is not usually counted among them, so I'm, sort of, at a loss for an explanation for this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As with many Nintendo Sports titles, Mario has been, sort of, shoehorned into the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the most obviously striking thing about "Punch-Out" is the exceptionally large sprites used for your opponents (and the rather detailed animations they're getting). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Glass Joe is about one third as tall as the screen is high. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And some of the larger fighters are actually closer to one half of the screen height. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each character has a very large number of individual poses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You wouldn't really describe the fighters on shout as 'realistic', but they do resemble animated cartoon characters, to a certain extent. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most video gaming characters back then how about maybe three to four different sprites used for animating the movements. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you compare the boxers in "Punch-Out" to [pretty] much any contemporary video game bosses, you'll see just how much detail was put in making them lifelike. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, unlike every other Nintendo-produced game we've seen in the last couple years, "Punch-Out" is, in fact, an Arcade port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original "Punch-Out" from 1984 used a weird double screen layout (much like Nintendo's, uh, Play Choice Arcade cabinets). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I actually guess it resembled a giant DS. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everything old comes around again, I suppose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game was notable for its excellent speech samples. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Going into [an] arcade at the time, you'd hear people playing "Punch-Out" with you know, 'Body blow!', 'Body blow!', 'Uppercut!' piercing through all the typical video game sound effects. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade Game plays a lot differently than the more familiar N.E.S. version and is more of a standard Boxing Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also impressive for the time: The fact that each boxer had, sort of, like, their own distinct personality. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they felt more like actual characters, rather than typical generic video game bad guys. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo quickly followed up with, uh, "Super Punch-Out" the same year. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really, it's the same game with new characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some (but not all) of these characters would find their way into the N.E.S. "Punch-Out". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After the second game, a semi-sequel came out in 1985, "Arm Wrestling". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This virtually forgotten title is important for one thing, in particular. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It marks Nintendo's exit from traditional Arcade Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the first home release of "Punch-Out" was a limited edition Gold cartridge, given out to players of the, uh, FamiCom "Golf" game who submitted their highest scores. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously this cart is quite hard to find and pricey now. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese Gold cart (as we see the game here) was simply entitled "Punch-Out" and was virtually identical to the later U.S. releases, but (did not feature any mention of Mike Tyson). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, back to the U.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Punch-Out" was intended to be a big title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was previewed in 'Nintendo Fun Club News' #3 and featured on the cover of #4. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Along with "Super Mario..." and "...Zelda" it became what would be called a 'killer app' for the N.E.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, scoring Mike Tyson's name and image for the game was a [pretty] huge coup. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1987, Tyson was the new Heavyweight Boxing champion and had become one of the most famous athletes in the world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Having won almost every fight of his professional career by knockout (often in the first round), Tyson qualified as one of the first superstar boxers the sport had seen for quite a while. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He was then added in as the final opponent in Punch-Out, and then given a U.S. release in October 1987 as "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game was then later given a general release in Japan in November. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, Nintendo has released quite a few Sports titles since the FamiCom's debut in 1983. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But "Punch-Out" is far and away the best. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's in a class by itself, really. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It has, uh, on occasion, been compared to a Puzzle Game rather than typical Sports Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each boxer ya fight has a series of standard punches as well as special moves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fighters generally give some sort of sign before they throw a punch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Like Piston Honda we saw there a moment ago, like, slightly raises his eyebrows. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Often a character will, like, flash a certain color, but you'll see some kind of on-screen indication telling you they're about ready to attack. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the first, uh, step is, uh (to learning how to defeat a boxer) is to, sort of, identify when they're going to attack you, and then dodge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, when a boxer throws a powerful punch and you successfully dodge, you will usually have an opportunity to counter-attack (often by stunning your opponent). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 King Hippo is a good example of a boxer needing, sort of, special tactic to defeat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He keeps his weak spot (which is his bandaged naval) covered up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As he prepares to throw a strong punch, you can hit him in the face, which caused him to lower his guard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can then hit him repeatedly in the naval, as he tries to pull up his pants. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] not [only] short the whole deal with the naval is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I have seen the thing with two adhesive bandages, uh, covering naval in an X on other Japanese video game characters (in "Parodius", for example). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] not really sure what that's supposed to indicate. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe trying to give the character an infantile quality? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, quick reflexes are required for the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole necessity of finding the weak spot makes it seem a lot different than some of the other Boxing Games we've seen (uh... such as "Ring King" or "Rocky"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Punch-Out" is lightyears ahead of those games, in terms of quality and playability. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from the obvious considerations like the distinctive opponents, "Punch-Out"s controls and handling are far superior. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Play "Ring King" then "Punch-Out" and it's like trying to go from steering a wheelbarrow to driving a sports car. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Precise timing is required in the game, and the game delivers completely. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you fail at "Punch-Out" it's entirely your fault. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wonky controls are not an issue. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Boy! You really sure, sort of, hate this guy - the way he flexes his pectoral muscles, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why are so many boxers wearing, like, tiny spandex shorts, as opposed to regular boxing shorts? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, once you've defeated him, you then get to encounter the real champion, Mike Tyson, himself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some serious skills are required for Tyson. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He punches very quickly and one punch will actually knock you out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... At first he's seemingly unbeatable but, if you're quick enough, you can persevere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Punch-Out" was actually re-released in the U.S. in 1990 (this time without Mike Tyson). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tyson's sprite was, uh, slightly touched up and renamed Mr. Dream. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In a rather ugly postscript, a follow-up does -- was designed by Beam Software, "Mike Tyson's Intergalactic Power Punch". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo decided not to publish the game and it was eventually released by American Soft Works as "Power Punch II" with, uh, Mike Tyson's name removed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is really terrible, but I suppose it's a story for a future episode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's often assumed that Tyson was removed from the game, due to his arrest and conviction for rape, but that didn't occur until 1991. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 More than likely, the original agreement just expired and Nintendo didn't want to cough up any more cash to renew it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tyson actually lost his title after being knocked down by Buster Douglas in early 1990 and his appeal was starting to fade. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Punch-Out" received a sequel for the Super Nintendo and, more recently, a completely reworked version for the Wii. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For such an immensely popular game, it's strange that Nintendo let this franchise lie dormant for so long. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Karate Kid 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atlus 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by LJN 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the sad part of "Chrontendo Episode 24" the grand debut of LJN - the first U.S.-based publisher to release games designed specifically for the U.S. market. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They released three games in October 1987, so let's start with "Karate Kid". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, LJN was a toy company that had been around since 1970. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They released toys like a 'Thundercats', 'Voltron', all sorts of things. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1986, they were bought by Universal Pictures (which naturally resulted in many movie spin-off games). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later, they were bought by Acclaim and eventually shuttered in 1994. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Their games are generally considered to be not good. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Karate Kid" is divided up into several types of gameplay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first is a series of four one-on-one battles, recreating the end of the first "Karate Kid" movie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can [pretty] much defeat each of the four enemies simply by kicking them repeatedly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fighting Games weren't really too advanced in 1987, but, uh, this is terrible, even by those standards. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, don't expect any, sort of, cutscenes or plot delineation in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's simply a series of unconnected segments, based loosely on different parts in the movies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the second level (and there are four, total) this is where the game really falls apart. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Daniel-san in Okinawa?', you say. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it becomes clear this is not based on the original 1984 "Karate Kid" movie, but on the 1987 sequel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this movie, Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio travel to Okinawa in order to do battle with... greedy industrialists or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... Really unfortunately, this game fails, due to really bad controls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, however, there are these little breaks in the main gameplay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... These little minigames are almost like micro games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I actually, sort of, like the presentation on that one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With the large sized character and the rather fluid-looking animation, it's a bit more impressive than the main game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, you know, while "Karate Kid" is not that bad graphically, and there are some nice details, and the music was actually presentable it raises the question about these LJN games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... LJN, being a toy company, they didn't do any in-house development, so who actually did these? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, they were generally contracted out to people like Rare and sometimes Japanese developers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, it seems that Atlas is responsible for the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even though this does fall well below the quality of games like "Bio Senshi Dan" or "Megami Tensei". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Atlas presumably subcontracted some of the work out to other folks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, a little bug, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's [only] ever, uh, two enemies on the screen at once. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, if you have enemies behind you, you can simply walk forward and you won't get attacked by any more enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the first boss is just some boring guy in a brown shirt. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, while the entire game suffers from insipid level design, it actually gets worse as it goes along. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Level 3 is just like Level 2, [only] with a monsoon blowing, which is constantly pushing you backwards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, naturally you're also being pelted by little sticks and what are either small yellow birds or banana peels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole 'blowing wind' thing was employed [pretty] well in other games like "Ninja Gaiden II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But here (combined with the games terrible controls) it makes this Level 1 of the most unpleasant experiences I've ever had on FamiCom so far. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, I played the entire level through gritted teeth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The controls in the whole game are terrible (and I mean *terrible*)! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, your jump. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's done by pressing Up on the D-Pad, but it's pathetically short and rather silly looking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you're hit by an enemy you don't just get pushed back a bit; you're actually sent flying through the air. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When two enemies start hitting you on both sides, you end up being bounced around like a pinball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Combine this with the awful jump and the wind, and you've got a seriously unpleasant gaming experience. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I actually quit in utter disgust before finishing this level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Karate Kid" is seriously not good. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jaws 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Westone 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by LJN 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, granted, there are some serious limitations on the sound capabilities of the N.E.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But is that really supposed to be the "Jaws" theme? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Karate Kid", "Jaws" is a property of Universal Pictures. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, while the game does not actually come out and say this, this game is clearly based, not so much on the classic 1975 Steven Spielberg movie, but on the awful "Jaws: The Revenge" from 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Jaws: The Revenge" has been widely mocked, especially for its tagline, "This Time It's Personal.". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, naturally, "Jaws" the video game is a terrible game, but at least it's very short. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A quick check on YouTube turns up playthroughs that clock in at about four to six minutes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And these don't really require any sort of, like, fancy tricks really. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the object is simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have, sort of, this ship that you stick around on the overWorld Map, moving back and forth between the two docks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The actual map is very small. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, we'll hit something (the game doesn't really specify what). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you'll engage in these brief scuba diving sequences where you shoot the marine life (uh, jellyfish and stingrays). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Every so often they'll drop shells. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those are what you want to grab. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After a minute of doing this (I guess you have to kill a certain number of enemies) you'll be back on the ship. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you actually reach one of the ports, you can trade in the shells for something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first thing you actually get is a tracking device that'll allow you to find "Jaws". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It doesn't really do that much. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It, sort of, makes a beeping noise when you get close to him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, basically want to keep going back and forth between the two ports, trading in the shells that you get. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... This will actually start raising your power level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you've done this a few times, you'll be strong enough to actually defeat "Jaws" himself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and, every so often, you need these really annoying little bonus sequences, in which you try to drop bombs on jellyfish (which seems like a real waste of ammunition, quite frankly). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, once you've actually run into "Jaws" himself, you're gonna have to defeat him with your spear gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, while you're in the water with Jaws, you need to shoot him repeatedly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, the jellyfish themselves are actually more dangerous than Jaws. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing you can find that'll make the job a bit easier is a submarine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you've gotten Jaws' health down to zero, you need to complete one last brief section. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As "Jaws" gets close, you need to drop these, uh, sort of, depth charges which will cause him to jump out of the water. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you try to ram him with the boat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The timing on this is [pretty] tricky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to, sort of, be right at the exact distance from "Jaws" and he has to -- his fin has to be lined up precisely with the tip of your boat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You [only] have three of these explosives, which they call 'strobes'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, if that doesn't work, you'll have to basically start again by defeating "Jaws" and bringing his health back down. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is actually taken directly from the end of the "Jaws: Rhe Revenge" movie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is how they killed the shark in the movie. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh! There we go! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, "Jaws" sinks down to the bottom of the sea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If he's dead wouldn't he float? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Jaws" was actually developed by Westone - the same guys who did "Wonder Boy" for Sega, which was converted into "Adventure Island" by Hudson. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this game is... (well) not up to the same standards set by "Wonder Boy"; that's for sure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All in all, a [pretty] terrible game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gotcha! The Sport 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sanritsu Denki 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by LJN 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our third and final LGN game is a little different, "Gotcha! The Sport!" (which just happens to be a Light Gun Game). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this being an LJN game, you must think this is based on a movie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, sort of. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is based on paintball (one particular variant of which, uh, was called "Gotcha!" back in the 1980s). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A subsidiary of LJN, called Intertek, made various sorts of toy guns and related things and came out with a home paintball game for kids, under the name "Gotcha! The Sport!". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, Universal (LJN's parent company) had also released a movie called "Gotcha!" in 1985. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Starring Anthony Edwards, the movie is about a young paintball enthusiast who gets caught up in some sort of international intrigue. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, "Gotcha! The Sport" (the game) has nothing to do with this movie's plot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead, it's, sort of, a typical Light Gun Game with a paintball theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This means that when hit, the other gunman put their hands up and march away, as opposed to blinking out of existence. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, there is a bit more to "Gotcha!" than that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see, uh, this is, sort of, like a Capture the Flag, sort of, game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object is to get the other team's flag, um, which is always on the opposite side of the map from your flag. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can see it on the little map up there at the top. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The unique thing about "Gotcha!" is the screen doesn't scroll automatically (as in most other Light Gun Games). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, you have to use the D-Pad to move across the playing field. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This means you have the Light Gun in one hand and the controller in the other (which will irritate those who like to look intense by holding a Light Gun in both hands like a real handgun). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your ammo is very limited. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Oops! [I] got shot there.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you, sort of, need to avoid firing wildly and, uh, make sure you shoot the ammo boxes when possible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so you go over, shoot the other team's flag, then march all the way back, get to your side, and then you have won the level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you move on to the next level, uh, which is an urban-themed level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, after this, there's a, sort of, snowy winter-scape level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the game quickly cycles back to the first level, then repeats. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One aspect not found in other Light Gun Games is that you can avoid enemy fire by simply continuing to move until the other gunman is simply off the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This means you have to make a decision whenever a gunman appears: keep moving (and hope he doesn't have time to shoot you before disappearing), or stop moving and shoot him, or try to shoot him while still moving. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, this will make him a little harder to hit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All in all, "Gotcha!" is [pretty] good for a Light Gun Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are actually elements of strategy involved. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know who developed this game, but it certainly is the best of the three LJN games this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 The Chrontendo 1987 Arcade Game Round-Up ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# Intro: Arcade Scene + Genres ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While Arcade Games were not the cultural phenomenon they were in the early '80s, video arcades were still very much a viable business at that time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And all the major video game publishers were still putting most (if not all) of their resources into Arcade Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll see that most games of the time fall into a set number of genres. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Prior to the Beat-'em-Up or Fighting Game explosion, the most prominent genres were Shooters and Platformers. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Taito ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's start by looking at one of the oldest established Japanese companies, Taito. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taito had a [pretty] good year, releasing a number of interesting games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh [mentioned, not seen] ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, there were some sequels involved, such as the second "Arkanoid" game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Rainbow Islands ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or "Rainbow Islands", the sequel to "Bubble Bobble". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Rainbow Islands" gets a [pretty] big graphical upgrade and seems much more modern than the first "Bubble Bobble" game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, instead of bubbles you kill your enemies with rainbows. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, that's insane. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Rastan ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taito also released a few fantasy-themed Action Platformers like the "Conan"-inspired Hack-'n'-Slash, "Rastan". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game got a Sega Master System port, for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems somewhat similar to "Rygar". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Wardner ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also "Wardner" - a cute variation on the same idea with much more platforming. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, you throw a magical fire spill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll see a port of this for the F.D.S. later. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ghosts 'n Goblins" seems to be the archetype for these sorts of games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though presumably the success of the, uh, Platformer-heavy FamiCom had something to do with it as well. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Flying Shark ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taito also employed developer Toaplan for two Vertical Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Flying Shark" is technically nice looking game, but is absurdly hard, mostly due to the fact that waves of enemies all come in from the top and both sides all at once, with paths of bullets flying everywhere, including diagonally. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All of this seriously reducing the space you have to move around freely in. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Twin Cobra ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Twin Cobra" was a sequel to "Tiger-Heli" (which we've also seen porting to the N.E.S.). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Twin Cobra", as the name implies, adds 2-Player co-op. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game is quite similar to "Flying Shark" and features such Toaplan trademarks as a Super Bomb to cause massive damage to all enemies within range, as well as ground enemies which you can be hit with your regular gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And "Twin Cobra" is thankfully not quite as tough as "Flying Shark". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Operation Wolf ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Military Games were quite popular at this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another example is "Operation Wolf", which has this great fetishistic opening sequence. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You use one of those mounted positional guns, found in arcades at the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, positional gun (or Light Gun Games) were not very common, as they later became. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Operation Wolf", sort of, stood out back in 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Wolf" earned several sequels and numerous ports. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The idea behind the game is simple: 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] much, shoot everything that moves. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Top Speed ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there were still a few old-fashioned top-down Driving Games being produced in 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But Sega's "OutRun" inspired more cutting-edge 3D Driving Games, with lots of crazy sprite scaling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Top Speed" is a fine example of the 'Let's outdo "OutRun"'-style game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One added feature: Nitrus, which provide quick bursts of speed. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Continental Circuit // Continental Circus ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also very cool was "Continental Circuit" an F1 Racing Game (also known as "Continental Circus"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The tracks were based on real-life racing tracks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, for added realism, other cars will throw off debris as they get damaged. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some versions had a built-in 3D viewfinder. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when you die, you get this huge impressive explosion with a tire flying right at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's [pretty] cool. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Namco ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of Taito's big rivals from the get-go was Namco, whose "Pac-Man" challenged "Space Invaders" for Arcade supremacy, years earlier. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Pac-Mania ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namco released a few sequels to earlier Arcade hits in 1987, including "Pac-Mania". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namco, dropped the platforming from "Pac-Land" and instead went back to the original concept and made what is essentially a fancier version of "Pac-Man". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One obvious difference: you can't see the whole maze at once. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game might have been Namco's last real "Pac-Man" Arcade Game, I believe. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Shadow Land ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Pac-Mania" used the new Namco System 1 board, which debuted in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Shadow Land" is another Yokai-themed game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese love these, apparently. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The people trapped in the pit is [pretty] creepy lookin'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are very light R.P.G. elements in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can buy items with the money you collect. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... We'll see this get ported a few times, down the road. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Dragon Spirit ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namco also reworked their classic Shooter, "Xevious" into "Dragon Spirit", which had a, sort of, unusual Fantasy theme to it (I mean, at least unusual for Shooters). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While the game works very much like "Xevious", it has a few power-ups added in and it's, uh, more difficult (namely, because your dragon is just so frickin' huge). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, expect to see a port of this, shortly. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Sega ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, Sega, despite putting lots of time and energy into the Master System, continued release top-notch Arcade Games In '87. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Wonder Boy in Monster Land ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Westone and Sega teamed up again for a sequel to "Wonder Boy" (which was nothing at all like the first game). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Instead of running around in a grass skirt, "Wonder Boy" now battles monsters in a fantasy setting, and can wear armor, and wield swords. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Weird, but this is the direction the series went from here on out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, the influence of R.P.G.s is making itself felt in arcades. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to collect money in order to equip yourself with items, armor, weapons, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This could almost be a console game, and we'll see a port (actually multiple ports) of it eventually. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Shinobi ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Shinobi" kicked off the well-loved ninja Platformer series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What can you say here? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You're a ninja and you're out to rescue some kids. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because that's what ninjas do. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They perform good deeds. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Along the way, you'll fight enemies that look kind of like copyrighted comic book characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game, of course, also spawned tons of sequels. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸After Burner II ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, Sega released more entries in its series of Super Scaler 3D games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "AfterBurner" being the next game in the, uh, Super Scaler family. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, there's a military theme. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is actually "Afterburner II", which is simply a slightly improved version of "AfterBurner (I)". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Expect to see attempts at console ports very soon. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Thunder Blade ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A little different was "Thunder Blade", which alternate between top-down sequences and behind-the-jet views. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, the game employed a rather, uh, clever use of stacked sprites to make the buildings look three-dimensional. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll notice there are, sort of, several flat layers, which move in such a way that gives the illusion of perspective. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually very creative. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Heavyweight Champ ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, less successful was "Heavyweight Champ", which had the bad luck of coming out the same year as "Punch-Out" for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, this game is no "Punch-Out", but it looks, sort of, decent, I suppose. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸S.D.I. ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, we have "S.D.I.", a trackball game, uh, in which can protect the world from nuclear destruction. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The intro seems rather inappropriate in the post-9-11 world. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sega had also released "Missile Defense 3D" for the Master System. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess someone at Sega was really into the idea of trying to update Atari's "Missile Command". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Atari Games ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Speaking of Atari, Atari Games were still around, even though most of the big U.S. Arcade manufacturers were now being overshadowed by Japanese companies. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Blasteroids ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Blasteroids" was Atari's sequel to "Asteroids" and is actually a [pretty] cool game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some modern elements (like power-ups and multiple stages) have been added. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, Industrial Light and Magic assisted with the computer graphics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I will admit, it is a very nice looking game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Xybots ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Xybots" was an oddball 3D Maze Game, and it's been almost completely forgotten. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, it's strange; playing it now, it feels, sort of, like a predecessor to "Wolfenstein 3D" or other early First-Person Shooter games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tengen created an N.E.S. port, but it was never released. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Xybots" was, I guess, a little ahead of its time. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Xenophobe ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bally Midway had a popular game, uh, with, uh, 3 Player "Rampage" in 1986, and "Xenophobe" is, sort of, a Sci-Fi follow-up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, in "Xenophobe" all three players can be in different rooms at once, thus resulting in the need for three different screens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, Bally decided to simply divide the game's one screen into three horizontal slices - [an] interesting idea, but it leaves each player with a little tiny play area. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Spy Hunter II ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much worse was "Spy Hunter II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [The] game featured a 2-Player mode and 3D graphics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, man! This looks terrible! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, [it has] no relation to the much better "Super "Spy Hunter" for the NWS. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Capcom ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Capcom continued to follow up successful games like "1942" and "Ghosts 'n Goblins" with similar releases. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸1943: The Battle of Midway ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Such as "1943" (which is very similar to "1942" but with a few things added like a Life Bar and, of course, the inner level bosses). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The spread shot is quite handy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, [there's] nothing too impressive or innovative, here. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Black Tiger // Black Dragon ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Black Tiger" (a.k.a. "Black Dragon") is a Sword and Sorcery game in the style of "Ghosts 'n Goblins". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As was the fashion, you collect money and buy items in the shops. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, "Black Tiger" is actually a [pretty] fun little game, uh, though it's certainly not as well-remembered as "Ghosts 'n Goblins". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's also not as sadisticly hard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It's] definitely worth trying this one out. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Tiger Road ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Black Tiger" should not be confused with "Tiger Road" (a somewhat similar game, though is -- with a, uh, Chinese theme). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are tons of enemies and thankfully you have a decent sized Life Bar and you can pick up better weapons than the axe you start out with. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much like, uh, "Black Tiger" this is an overlooked game that scored, uh, some computer ports, but never had any sequels. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Top Secret // Bionic Commando ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much better known is "Bionic Commando", uh, the game whose N.E.S. port remains well-loved to this very day. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade original (also known as "Top Secret" in Japan) isn't really that great. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the whole mechanical arm thing is original, to say the least. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, be advised that other than the basic gameplay mechanics, the Arcade "Bionic Commando" is completely different than the home version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, if you're familiar with that and you play this, you might be a little disappointed. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Street Fighter ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And speaking of disappointment, there was also "Street Fighter", Capcom's one-on-one Fighting Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most Fighting Games at this time were rough around the edges and "Street Fighter (I)" is no exception. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It's] a very great looking game, uh, but it's difficult to control. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the special moves like the fireball are very hard to pull off. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, you [only] get the choice of two characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you played "Street Fighter II" (and you probably have) then prepare to be massively disappointed if you pick this game up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a real shame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the speech is [pretty] awful as well. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Konami ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, let's move on to Konami. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Contra ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They released one of 1987's big big games, "Contra". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! Pure Run and Gun action; this is where it all started. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For those who don't know, "Contra" is, uh, great-looking, fun, and [pretty] darned hard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You lose a lot of lives and there are limited continues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is [pretty] short, but, uh, it's not that easy to make it to the end. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Power-ups are essential - in particular, the Spread Shot (a landmark in the world of overpowered weapons upgrades). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Contra" alternates between Horizontal and 3D Maze sequences, with bosses at the end of each level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, this was ported to the FamiCom and N.E.S. and became one of the all-time-great games for that system. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Ajax ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, Konami released other cool games like "Ajax", which played a lot like "Twin Cobra" ([only] with a separate Bomb button to attack ground enemies). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, we see a very heavy military theme, especially in Shooters, which, uh, mostly has, sort of, Sci-Fi setting, until recently. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like the two Taito games, "Ajax" can get a bit hectic at times. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Battlantis ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another long-forgotten Konami game, "Battlantis". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (I guess it's a combination of 'battle' and 'Atlantis'.). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is actually an update on "Space Invaders", of all things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Except, here, instead of fighting aliens, you're battling guys who want to, like, uh, attack your castle, including these one guys who will, sort of, run and, uh, climb up the walls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It's a] very interesting game and definitely worth checking out. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Blades of Steel ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Blades of Steel" is a fine and rather dramatically named Hockey Game and it also got a great home port on the N.E.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Certainly the best Hockey Game so far, "Blades of Steel" was fast, easy to control, and it had fights. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! You could smack around other players and get a fight started. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, that is really cool! 


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Dark Adventure ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dark Adventure", on the other hand, was, sort of, an oddball title - a three-person "Gauntlet" clone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [You] probably have not seen this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The best thing might just be the cool intro. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Similar to the intros we've seen from Konami on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like "Arumana no Kiseki", one character is modeled after Indiana Jones. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And besides the typical swords and bows, your characters can get flame throwers, dynamite, and laser. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This has never been ported to any system that I know of. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Smaller Publishers ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Double Dragon ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Technos was a much smaller company. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But they somehow managed to release one of 1987's biggest hits, "Double Dragon", a follow-up to "Renegade", whose FamiCom port we've already covered. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Double Dragon" [pretty] much ignited the whole Beat-'em-Up genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Multi-player Beat-'em-Up games would become perhaps the dominant genre in arcades in the late '80s and early '90s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Virtually all of those games were following in "Double Dragon"'s footsteps. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Super Dodge Ball ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not nearly as huge (but still [pretty] cool) was "Super Dodgeball" another Kunio-kun game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There aren't exactly a whole lot of Dodgeball video games, so this one stands out a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, we're going to see a port to the N.E.S.. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸R-Type ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Among other smaller manufacturers, we have Irem, whose "R-Type" we just discussed last episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "R-Type" was the most advanced Shoot-'em-Up released at this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Graphics, controls, cool design, awesome weapons - "R-Type" had it all and puts [pretty] much all other Shooters to shame. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Mr. Heli ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Including "Mr. Heli", a cute helicopter-based Shooter from Irem. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why all the helicopter Shooters, I wonder? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmm. I don't know. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It's] a fine little game but certainly overshadowed by "R-Type". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the cool thing was, you could actually fire going in the vertical direction as well as horizontally. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to destroy those little blocks that you found that have crystals that drop down. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Tecmo Bowl ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tecmo released its classic Football Game, "Tecmo Bowl" in 1987. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade version is a bit different from the N.E.S. release. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's for four players at once and had a super wide screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like "Bionic Commando", the Arcade version tends to be overlooked, simply because of the home version being so much more popular. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While the Arcade "Tecmo Bowl" is not as great as the home version, it's still [pretty] impressive for a 1987 Football Game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Guerilla War ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Mopping up a few stragglers, we have "Guerilla War" from SNK (a follow-up of sorts to "Ikari"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Guerrilla War" has you plan as either Che Guevara or Fidel Castro. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's a [pretty] amazing idea for a game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Japan, it was actually called "Che Guevara". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As for the game, well, it's a lot like "Ikari". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... SNK would start working on its Neo Geo system in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this would obviously bit of a -- be a bit of a game-changer for the company. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Karnov ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 From Nihan Busan (also known as Nichibutsu), we have "Karnov" - another Arcade Game known for its N.E.S. port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also for its title character, who really isn't your typical video game protagonist. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A decent enough game, in the "Ghosts 'n Goblins" mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, at this time, uh, Nihan Busson (or, uh, Nichibutsu's) - their main focus really seems to be putting out tons and tons of adult Mahjong games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Conclusion ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that wraps up our overview of the Arcade Games of 1987! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is not all of them, by any stretch of the imagination, but I think we've seen all or most of the major titles (with the big ones being "Contra", "R-Type", and "Double Dragon"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, we'll return to the FamiCom games! 



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Uchuusen Cosmo Carrier 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November 06 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 From Jaleco, we have what appears to be a very minor title, "Uchuusen Cosmo Carrier" ('Uchuusen' meaning 'Spaceship'). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The name seems a little redundant to me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But perhaps the game itself is a little redundant. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have two similar games this episode - the other being "Artelius". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Uchuusen..." is a typical first-person space Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This falls into the general category of "Star Raiders"-type games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've seen a few of these for the FamiCom already. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, the, uh, very similarly-titled "Cosmo Genesis" from ASCII, which came out back in December 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., it was called "Star Voyager". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The name "Cosmo Carrier" makes me wonder, 'Was Jaleco deliberately copying "Cosmo Genesis"?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, if so, it's a rather odd choice for a game to rip-off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As it is in other 'Star Raiders' games, ya fly around shooting enemy spacecraft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can take a certain amount of damage but eventually your ship will start failing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also warp to other areas; that's what the 'Move' button is for. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, there is one rather strange design decision. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have all those menus below. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you attack an enemy, your crosshair will lock onto them and both you and the enemy will freeze while you select your attack options from the menu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (For example, you have 'Missile' and 'Beam'.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But while you are attacking one enemy the rest are not frozen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, they can still fly around and shoot you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you kind of become, like, a sitting duck while you're trying to shoot down an enemy, which is actually very bizarre. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I'm sure there is perhaps a bit more to this game than this (or, at least, I certainly hope so). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But "Uchuusen..." doesn't really seem to, sort of, stick out from the pack of similar games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, I've warped to the, uh, orange planet, and there are actually, uh, much tougher enemies flying around this one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Watching this, you can see exactly how the whole bit about you freezing while the enemies do not, sort of, hampers your ability to defend yourself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All in all, it's another, sort of, oddball title from Jaleco. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Lupin III: Pandora no Isan 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November 06 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco | Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully the name 'Namco' will inspire a bit more confidence than 'Jaleco'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our next game gets right down to the point rather quickly, with this kidnapped girl opening. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A girl kidnapped? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What a crazy idea for a video game! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, this is "Lupin III: Pandora no Isan" - a Japan-[only] game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, we have a very nice unofficial translation available from Vice Translations. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In a thoughtful touch, the game begins with an Arcade-like Demo Mode, with each character having an introduction and a brief scene of them in action. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The three main characters seen here are Lupin the Third and his associates, Daisuke Jigen and Ishikawa Goemon the [Thirteenth] (who's a samurai dude who is supposedly the descendant of the legendary thief). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you recall Konami's, 'Ganbare Goemon' game, which featured Ishikawa Goemon the First. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so who is this Lupin guy? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, odds are you already know - but, just in case, Arsene Lupin was a gentleman thief from a series of books by the French author, Maurice LeBlanc. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The character was very popular in the first part of the 20th century, with various Lupin movies being released (mostly before 1940). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then, in the 1960s, manga artist, Monkey Punch, created the Lupin the Third character (grandson of the original Lupin). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Did this comment get made into an anime? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, what do you think? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Numerous T.V. shows and movies have been made - most famously "The Castle of Cagliostro" - the first film directed by Miyazaki. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Scenes from that movie were used to make the LaserDisc video game "Cliffhanger". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Folks who are familiar with the animated series might know the name is usually pronounced 'Lou-Pon' (as opposed to 'Lou-Pan'), since that is the closest equivalent in Japanese. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Lupin III" is a 'run and jump and shoot', sort of, game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've seen many games similar to this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, like so many games of the era, it's a little incoherent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, 'Who are all these guys, uh, shooting at Lupin?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what's with the cats? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why do all the cats want to kill him? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if this guy is such a great thief, I mean, how could even get killed by a cat, anyway? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite all this, the game works [pretty] well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Lupin can take [only] one hit before dying, but collecting armored jackets will enable him to take an additional hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I do like the cool way that Lupin can pick up speed, running, uh, down roofs, then leap onto the next building. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The jumping controls are [pretty] decent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And considering how bad jumping hampers so many games in this era, it's quite an accomplishment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And one thing is: 
🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you die, you have to select one of the remaining characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jigen (uh, seen here) has a more powerful gun, but je can't use all the items. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game comprises four relatively long levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing you'll be doing a lot is entering rooms and checking to see if there's any other characters or any special items in, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As a rule, you find items in those little white things (which, I suppose, are supposed to be brief cases). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Among the various things you'll find will be infrared goggles, bombs to find hidden passages, special limited-use weapons, ...all kinds of interesting things. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, while the game is reasonably playable, there are moments that do seem a little bit stupid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The enemy AI is [pretty] non-existent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And from time to time, various sorts of gameplay issues will pop up that'll cause you to pull your hair out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, I tried switching characters before entering the boss room. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But when I did this, Inspector Zenigata appeared right next to me, thus leading to an unavoidable unfair death. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, sort of, like "Mega Man", the bosses are made much easier if you use the right character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll go inside the room, then switch to Jigen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He can shoot all the way across the screen, thus rendering, uh, the boss [pretty] much helpless. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another cool little touch is a little bit of dialogue after the boss is defeated... that sort of moves the plot forward and, uh, gives justification for the next level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Compare this to something like, uh, "Karate Kid", which is just a bunch of, sort of, random crap thrown together. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game was co-developed by Namco and Tose (of all people). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll assume Namco was responsible for all the good parts and Tose for the rest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Certainly this stands well above other Tose product (like, uh, the second 'Kinnikuman' game, for example). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, don't be mistaken into thinking that "Lupin..." is some sort of forgotten classic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It can be quite aggravating in spots, but it does hold up surprisingly well (especially compared to its contemporary licensed games). 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Artelius 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November 13 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nichibutsu 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nichibutsu 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I have no idea what this has to do with the game! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the FamiCom has a [pretty] slim release schedule in November so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're already halfway through the month! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last episode, we had all those R.P.G.s, as you recall. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well R.P.G.s will keep on coming. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here's this episode's "Artelius". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The plot is detailed in this rather groovy Engrish-filled introduction. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In short, you're a cyborg, created to save humanity from evil alien forces. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, it's a space version of [pretty] much every R.P.G. plot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, don't get too excited if you are expecting some sort of Science-Fiction R.P.G. epic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Artelius" is more like "Zoids" in space. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, one nice thing about this game, there's actually plenty of save spots (more than you'll ever use, trust me). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game starts out with you -- instead of getting orders from the King, you start talking to some very chatty computers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy actually goes on for quite a while. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What I don't know is, 'Why is he shaped like the White House?'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After him, you'll end up talking to two more computers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both have quite a lot say. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, this is, sort of, like the, uh, "Metal Gear Solid 2" of FamiCom games, so far. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually you'll get around to assigning your attribute points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And every time you Level Up, a couple of your attributes will go up as well (automatically; it's not like 'Ultima'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I call this an R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's really [only] because of the character-building aspect. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The structure of the game is [pretty] linear and consists of levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You move from level to level by finding these warp points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I] just found the first one, there, and I'm on Level 1, now. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Here's my stats.). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, we're in space, uh, but the rows of impassable asteroids turn the level into what's essentially a dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can't quite roam around, like you can on the overworld of most R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Visible enemies are flying around, constantly coming and going. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And once you collide with an enemy, you'll engage in some one-on-one combat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can see here why I said the game resembles "Zoids". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both games have "Battlezone"-like combat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, here, the enemy ships can move up and down and all over. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess it's actually quite similar to "Star Raiders". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Star Raiders" first came out in 1979 and eight years later is still being widely borrowed from. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At any rate, I'm sure by now you know the drill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shoot the other spaceship; get some Experience Points and some money. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After a few battles, 'you class' will increase to 2. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though annoyingly, when you Level Up your health is not replenished. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, that should be a law - that R.P.G.s have to replenish your health whenever you Level Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest" and similar games do this, but some R.P.G.s with old-school attitude do not. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I love the fact that the first outpost looks just, sort of, like a house floating in space. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy will sell you stuff and refill your energy and whatnot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, what you're actually looking for in the first level is the warps that go onto Level 2. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And what's the exciting thing about Level 2? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, when you get there, there's a space station. Hurray. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, a lot of the enemies look a little goofy, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These look like guys who are flying around in, like, space scooters or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Here I found the warp and we're on to Level 2. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, so far all this is [pretty] boring-looking, but other things happen later on; you get to land on planets and -- and do that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [The] Space Station is not hard to find. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this takes the place of your typical R.P.G. village. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and that's a weird-looking guy, right there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is an escape function. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Those guys can be a bit tough at times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the character designs in this game are actually [pretty] decent (even though they're clearly inspired by Star Trek). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is, sort of, the distant ancestor of "Mass Effect". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Artelius" was built by Nihan Busson (a.k.a. Nichibutsu). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 R.P.G.s are not really their forte, but at least the presentation is nice in spots. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes, and here's what you've been waiting for all this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep. The cat girl has now been officially introduced into console gaming (or at least I assume that's a girl). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Artelius" suffers from a lot of the same issues as other low-grade early R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's repetitive, the levels are bland and empty, you Level Up slowly, and the game will randomly throw way-too-powerful enemies at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like this guy! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's some sort of space bug. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Add in the rather irritating space combat and these guys are really hard-to-hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they have a game that doesn't hold up very well. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tanigawa Kouji no Shougi Shinan II 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November 13 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Pony Canyon 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another F.D.S. game "Tanigawa Kouji no Shougi Shinan II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And whoa! Who are those guys? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't think we ever get to find out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [This is a] rather exciting intro for a 'Shogi' game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! This is the third 'Shogi' game we've encountered. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last one was "Morita Shogi" from Random House (same guys who did "Hoshi no Miru Hito"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This and Ide Yosuke's Mahjong game from a couple episodes back underlies a trend we're starting to see - getting well-known individuals to lend their names to FamiCom games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here it's Tanigawa Kougi, a 'Shogi' player who rocketed to fame, uh, by becoming a top-ranked player at a young age. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the second of his 'Shogi' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first was released for the M.S.X. by Pony Canyon in 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tanigawa looks really pissed at you in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so what's going on with this game, here? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, you know, as I've mentioned before, 'Shogi' is a Japanese version of Chess. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both Chess and 'Shogi' originated from the same ancient game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's very similar to Chess, but different enough that knowing how to play Chess will not really help you too much when it comes to 'Shogi'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As the name 'Shougi Shinan' indicates, this is an instructional 'Shogi' game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from playing against the computer, there's also an option where Tanigawa assist you in your 'Shogi' strategy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this must have sold okay, since there was a sequel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game was also re-released on cartridge in 1988. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Faxanadu 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November 11 🇯🇵 // 1989 November 19 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nihon Falcom | Hudson 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson 🇯🇵 // Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're almost done here, folks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But wait! What's this? Another Nihon Falcom game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, not really. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Faxanadu" - sort of, based on Falcom's "Xanadu". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game has a rather nice intro here - very clearly in the style of "Bomber King". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Faxanadu" starts off with a rather interesting, uh, fashion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Contrary to standard R.P.G. rules, your character actually speaks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have him providing some of the narration. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You return to your home village, finding it nearly in ruins. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, what's going on? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, much like "Bomber King", uh, the land is in bad shape, due to some sort of ecological devastation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Semi-apocalyptic scenarios seem disturbingly popular in Japan, at this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The idea of a village suffering from some sort of drought or disease or a curse has turned up in a lot of other games (like "Romancia", "Hoshi no Miru Hito", "Momotaro Densetsu", "Castlevania II", and many others). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It must be something ingrained in the Japanese psyche. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Talking to the locals, you'll find that your elf village is in trouble, due to damage done to the World Tree. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole 'giant mystical tree' thing would turn up from time to time in R.P.G.s (such as in the 'Seiken Densetsu' games). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, let's get this out of the way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While "Faxanadu" has some well-executed graphics, the character portraits can be a bit creepy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're animated, but what's with those blinking eyes? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 My God! 
🤖🍪🍊🍓 Stop doing that, Blinky McBlinkerston! 
🤖🍪🍊🍓 You're, sort of, freaking me out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, problems with the wells again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Didn't we go through this earlier this episode? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, as you probably know, "Xanadu" was the second game released in Falcom's 'Dragon Slayer' series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was originally released in 1985 for Japanese computers, such as the P.C.-88. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This version, right here, is the M.S.X. version from 1987 (same game but with, uh, somewhat improved graphics). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Slayer" III: Romancia" clearly looks a lot like this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the original "Xanadu" does play a lot like "Romancia". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Xanadu" was probably one of the first successful R.P.G.s for Japanese computers (a huge hit)! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It also, uh, was quite involved and borrows things from Western R.P.G.s (like food, and there are tons of items, and your typical 'D&D' character stats) but the gameplay is side-scrolling Action R.P.G.-style. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and the first dungeon is notoriously hard to find! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Uh... Typical Falcom sadism, I suppose.). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, what about "Faxanadu"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the R.P.G. elements have been greatly simplified and streamlined. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This really has little to do with the original "Xanadu" game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's [pretty] much an entirely new game that uses a few ideas from Falcom's title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was actually designed by Hudson and seems much more like a standard console Action R.P.G. than something like "Romancia". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It kind of resembles "Castlevania II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the name is a portmanteau of 'FamiCom' and 'Xanadu'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you will find your standard villages, you know, filled up with shops, doctors, taverns, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are connected by these enemy-filled passages, and you will encounter doors to dungeons along the way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here I'm in the first dungeon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, you need to defeat the enemy at the end in order to get the magic, uh, you would need to break a wall outside the dungeon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's the game's general structure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Move forward, find the way blocked, look for an item, talk to an old man or something, get the passage unblocked, and then go forward. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While Hudson has modernized the gameplay, "Faxanadu" is far from perfect. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The boss battles are either very easy (oh, and very boring, like here) or they're hella tough (like when you had to fight one of these things, when there's no helpful little ledge to stand on). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each of those fireballs will take off a huge chunk of your health. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the fact that your original dagger has no range doesn't help. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another issue: 
🤖🍪🍊🍓 The enemies, uh, placement and erratic movements become [pretty] irritating. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll frequently find yourself entering a room and then immediately be hit by a lurking enemy (like when I exit this door, here). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even worse is when an enemy is located near the edge of the screen and hits you and pushes you back into the previous room every time you try to enter the room. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, there are some cool moments. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like here, for example, you need to put these Wing Boots, giving you temporary flight. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why? Well, you got to talk to this old guy who lives up in the sky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, it's not clear whether this really takes place inside or outside. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The setting of the game is very strange. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Supposedly, this all occurs inside the World Tree. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But why did they build all these stone walls and dungeons inside a tree? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah. When you finally get to this old guy he attempts to tell you where to go next, but it comes across as complete gibberish. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is a, sort of, a problematic localization. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, most of the other characters dialogue comes across as vague or just plain nonsensical. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, Hudson has reduced the R.P.G. elements to a bare minimum. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are a few types of weapons and armor, as well as Healing Potions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you need to actually buy your magic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also you need to buy keys. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are special keys for opening all the doors; there are Key Shops inside the villages. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Experience system is [pretty] odd. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You do get Experience Points, but Leveling Up doesn't increase your character's stats at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you die, you are resurrected at the last church you visited (and most of your money will be gone). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The [only] thing that your Level affects is how much Gold you'll have when you get resurrected. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's certainly a ...nique -- unique idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It doesn't affect your, uh, H.P. or -- or anything like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, clearly when Hudson redesigned this game, they completely altered the art style. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Faxanadu"'s graphical design is one of the most striking things about this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The backgrounds are very detailed (some of the best looking for the system). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game uses some never-before-seen effects (like, uh, here in this, uh, smoky poluted level, where everything is obscured by the murk). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the color palette can be a bit distressing, since it uses so many browns, tans, and yellows in places. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Faxanadu" is almost monochromatic in spots and a lot of the enemies are just one color. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I would hesitate to call "Faxanadu" a great game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are too many nagging little issues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it is a solid attempt to update "Xanadu" for a home console and features some of the most interesting art design we've seen so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kick Challenger Air Foot 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 November 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by VAP 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by VAP 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're down to the final game this episode and, as usual, it's an odd one: "Kick Challenger Air Foot". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But what the hell is this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't think this game is officially licensed by Nike. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But yet it seems this game is trying to cash in onto the sudden popularity of Air Jordans (which were first rolled out in 1985). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most alarming, however, is the name VAP in the credits. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The [only] other VAP game we've seen is "...Super Monkey Daibōken", which has the honor of being the worst game, so far, released on the FamiCom (at least in my opinion). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...Super Monkey Daibōken" was almost an anti-game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, picked "Challenger" couldn't possibly be that bad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it is [pretty] weird. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you play a tomato with feet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, not just any feet - sort of, like these gigantic Sasquatch-style feet... that aren't really attached to your body; they just kind of, uh -- you, sort of, float over your feet. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And each foot is controlled separately. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is, uh, you move a foot using the D-Pad and then you hit a button (the A button) to switch feet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, in order to walk, you, sort of, alternate Up, A, Up, A, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's awkward, but at least it is a rather original method for moving around your character. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also kick enemies with your feet by using the B button and, uh, make sure you're aware of which foot is actually active. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was trying to constantly kick an enemy on one side, but when hit the attack button, I realized the other foot was the foot that kicked. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Kick Challenger" is the first shoe fetish game for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kicking rocks and mushrooms will reveal power-ups, including different types of shoes (some with the Nike swoosh clearly visible). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you find your way out of a level, you battle a boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this guy's actually rather impressive looking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I have] no idea who really developed this game, but it is a huge step up from "...Super Monkey Daibōken". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The graphics are bright and cheery and they actually resemble the objects are supposed to represent, most of the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 VAP sure took their time in putting this thing out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Their last game, "...Super Monkey Daibōken" was released almost exactly a year ago, on November 21 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Kick Challenger" is not great, but once you get used to the weird controls, it's really not that bad. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 24 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, thanks for watching. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next time we go deeper into the 1987 holiday season as we reach December. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Would you believe [it]? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's another Konami-heavy episode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another highlight is a weird game from Namco, based on a very popular movie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And one of the most ridiculous FamiCom Disk System releases ever (from Data East). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, see you then!
