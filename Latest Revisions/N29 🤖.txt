👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 29 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hello, and welcome to "...Episode 29" of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will cover most of March 1988. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, as mentioned earlier, this is when the first wave of Military Strategy and Simulation Games hits Japanese consoles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, we'll see two similar games released on the very same day. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll also have a quick look at the rise and fall of Taito. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the way, those of you who have chronological lists of FamiCom releases might notice a couple missing games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those two "TwinBee" and the "Tanigawa Kōji..." game are simply re-releases of earlier titles on a different format. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We will always be skipping these, since we covered the games when they first came out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, let's go ahead and get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 T&C Surf Designs: Wood and Water Rage 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atlus | Sanritsu 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by LJN 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The N.E.S.' ability to generate wave-like white noise sounds comes in handy, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so let's go ahead and, uh, begin by mopping up February with a couple undated non-Japanese games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First up is "T&C... Wood and Water Rage" - a dirty-sounding name to be sure, but this LJN title is actually a [pretty] harmless little game in the "California Games" / "Skate or Die" mode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's two options here: Skating or Surfing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, those of you under the age of 25 might be a little baffled, wondering what all this crap is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, young people, let me explain it to ya. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'T&C' - that's Town and Country Surf Designs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They were a surfboard manufacturer who also had a clothing line. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the mid-1980s, they released a series of shirts, featuring designs by graphic artist Steven Nazhar, [with] all [of] these crazy surfing cartoon characters - Thrilla Gorilla, Joe Cool, a Caveman Surfer, a guy with a WitchDoctor mask, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These shirts were ubiquitous for a few years and enormously popular among young kids, for a brief time, before disappearing into obscurity. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, last episode, we saw a Ronald McDonald game and now we have this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, yeah, the N.E.S. is definitely becoming a bit crasser all the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So in the Skateboarding segment, ya navigate through a shockingly poorly maintained stretch of road, avoiding objects, holes in the road, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jumping over objects and doing simple skate tricks will get ya points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Along the way, you have to watch out for flying objects and, uh, remote control cars - that sort [of] thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The controls are [pretty] simple; you can move in four directions and jump - either by jumping off the skateboard or by grabbing and jumping with the board in the air as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the most irritating factor is that while the game depicts objects in pseudo-3D, using oblique perspective, the collision detection is more 2D. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thus, you can hit an object that you appear to be actually be going behind. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to literally be above the object, in order to pass behind it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The levels aren't too long and if ya get to the finish, the level will restart, though in a slightly longer version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's really [only] one level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object is simply to get as many points as you can. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the game still seems very Western to me, but it appears that LJN farmed out the development to Atlas, who then (according to, uh, Game Developer Research Institute), may have subcontracted it to Sanritsu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (And this is apparently also the case with "Gotcha! The Sport".) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, this game feels like a soulless contract work. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the second game here is Surfing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is where the rage kicks in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have the option of playing Thrilla Gorilla or Cool Cat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While the Skateboarding section isn't that bad, the Surfing tends to raise gamers' ire. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much like the Epyx Sports Games, the primary challenge here is figuring out the rather temperamental controls and the sketchy gameplay mechanics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You move your character, uh, either to the top or the bottom of the wave, and pressing the button will k... -- allow to perform your jump. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But some sort of gravitational force is constantly pulling you towards the left side of the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can generally resist for a little bit, but frequently, you'll suddenly lose control and get sucked into the wave, for some mysterious reason. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole thing is sorta baffling and irritating and is best avoided. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually, the entire game feels like a quickie cash-in and is probably {best} avoided as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, if ya actually like the 'T&C' games, there is going to be a sequel, which we'll have to cover, at some point. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 R.C. Pro-Am 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so how about a game people actually like? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's "R.C. Pro-Am", a U.S.-and Europe-[only] title from Nintendo, which came out sometime in February 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The exact date seems lost to the mists of time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This title was developed by Rare. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It says so, right on the title screen! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The habit of hiding your contract developers seems to be a Japanese thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo of America and most U.S. video game publishers had no problem admitting who actually made the games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, this is a game about racing radio-controlled trucks, hence "R.C. Pro-Am" Racing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which leads to the question, "Pro-Am? Are there actually professional R.C. car racers?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can see them racing for money, but do people actually do it professionally? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose it's entirely possible, though in real life they're probably not equipped with missiles and bombs, like the toys in this thing are. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which leads to an interesting point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This didn't actually start out as an R.C. car game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Fall '87 issue of 'Nintendo Fun Club News' had a preview, which shows the title screen with cars without antennas, and the name "Pro-Am Racing". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it seems the game was originally planned to be about actual car racing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the violence (you know, the missiles and whatnot) prompted Nintendo to alter the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shooting missiles at radio-controlled cars is one thing; shooting them at cars with actual people is another. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "R.C. Pro-Am" is, simply put, a Racing Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You do a few laps on the track and try not to come out last. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are some very simple R.P.G.-type elements added in (as is standard in Racing Games in 1988). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You sorta Level Up your car permanently by picking up upgrades to tires, the accelerator, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though not to the extent [of] some [of] the other recent car games, such as "Taito Grand Prix". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, also: You see down underneath the map of the track there to the letters 'N-I-N'? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you collect all the letters to form the word 'Nintendo', your car, sort of, powers up to be a better vehicle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I'll confess, I don't really like this game; I'm actually [pretty] terrible at it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the game was quite popular in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo heavily promoted it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was on the cover of the February - March 'Fun Club News'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, people have pleasant memories of it, to this day. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if you've never played it, I would definitely, uh, give it a try! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Druid: Kyoufu no Tobira 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 03 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Firebird | Jaleco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 March is here! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Chrontendo''s got March Madness. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I must be crazy for digging up some of these games, like "Druid" from Jaleco! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And great little animated intro from, uh, Jaleco there, by the way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so we've got the F.D.S. goin' here, and we'll actually see a [pretty] cool title screen! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There ya see a Druid and his Golem (an odd combination, since Druids were Celtic priests and Golems were generally, like, constructed by rabbis). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Creating a Golem is supposed to require the ability to write in Hebrew and it's not clear where a Druid would learn something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Auch questions aside, we would say that "Druid" is a simple little top-down Action Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, in retrospect, it looks kinda like a lame "...Zelda" clone, uh, which might be why Jaleco released it in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, very "...Zelda"-like! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This involves you running around, destroying enemies, opening up chests, getting items, that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, here's the thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually a port of a 1986 Computer Game from a somewhat-respected British publisher, called Firebird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It originally came out on various computer platforms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a quick look at some of these. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, is the ZX Spectrum version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was released on the Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari Computers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It's a] [pretty] ugly looking game, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Spectrum fans would find this brilliant. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everyone else, not so much. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually it made its way to Japan and received an [M.S.X.] 2 port, courtesy of Dexter Soft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The title screen shows a meaner-looking clean-shaven Druid, in contrast with the cute little wizard from the other versions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Dexter was a company which, uh, seems to had some kind of connection to Jaleco (having put out several Jaleco games on the M.S.X.). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, this is one ugly game - and suffers from the typical standard awful scrolling effects of the M.S.X.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So clearly, the FamiCom game, here, is the most aesthetically pleasing of all the versions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the time of its initial release, it was merely compared to "Gauntlet", despite being a single player game, as it involves running around dungeons and whatnot, shooting endless screens of ghosts and goblins. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this, sort of, makes sense. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For you younger folks, be aware that "Gauntlet" was an enormously popular game in arcades in the mid-'80s, and countless similar games were produced. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, ya roam around each level opening treasure chests, from which you can choose to pick up a weapons refill or sometimes a cure spell; you can [only] pick out one item. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One such spell is the Golem (who we saw a moment ago). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will generate a Golem to follow you around and take out enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though he seems to always walk behind you, so he's really not that useful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I realize now, this reminds me a lot of "Aztec Adventure" for the Master System, covered back in "Chronsega Number 4". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the actual object of each level is simply to find the exit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will generally require [you] to pick up some one-time-use keys to open various locked doors. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are supposedly eight levels altogether and, every so often, a boss will appear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The dungeons here seem a bit more "Gauntlet"-y than the, uh, wide-open outdoor spaces we saw at the beginning [of] the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there are some nice touches. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, for example, the spells have, like, um, an elemental property attached [to] them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And certain enemies will more [susceptible] to different types of elemental attacks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to us, like, fire for some enemies, lightning for the other. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But overall the game is [pretty] simple and repetitive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing exciting ever really happens in the game, and it seems very much like a pre-"...Zelda" Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's really not that much in the way of exploration or secrets or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... So all in all, I'd still consider it to be a [pretty] minor release from Jaleco. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 19 - Neunzehn 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 04 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Soft Pro International 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Soft Pro International 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh boy! Another inscrutable F.D.S. game from Soft Pro. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They started off making M.S.X. games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they moved on to such weird FamiCom titles as "Breeder" (the robot breeding and fighting game), and "[Pulsar no Hikari...]" (a bizarre Space Simulation Game). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Continuing in this fine tradition, we have "19" or "Neunzehn". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's usually listed as "19 - Neunzehn"; [I'm] not sure if it's '19 Neunzehn' or just 'Neunzehn'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mentioned the wave of Military Simulation-type Games headed for the FamiCom, and, uh, "Neunzehn" kicks things off today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [The] box art shows various Greco-Roman-style busts, so perhaps it's some sort of ancient warfare theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This leads to the question, 'Why is the game called "Neunzehn"? 19 what, exactly? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, Soft Pro is a bit ahead of its time, by giving this a German (or German-sounding) title (you know, sort of, like "Der Langrisser"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The box describes the game as a, uh, "Real Simuration Game". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Yes, it actually does say "Simuration".) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this appears to be a very simple, uh, turn-based Military Strategy Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, calling it 'Strategy' might be giving it a bit more complexity than it deserves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You choose one of four armies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya have a base. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Mine's the, uh, green one, up in the upper right-hand corner, there.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can manufacture more units. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Every turn you, uh, move your units. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you reach an enemy unit, a battle occurs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... Other than moving around and fighting battles, it isn't really clear to me what there is to do in "19". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't see any resources to collect or towns to capture. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps I didn't really get far enough into the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you can't really blame me, because the battle segments are so painful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nowadays, we think of these things as being either real-time or turn-based. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, the battles are, sort of, simultaneous turn-based, meaning the action freezes and you plan your moves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your units can move, attack, throw projectiles, or wait. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But after you're done, both sides move at the same time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This makes it difficult to plan out your moves, since you have no idea where the enemy is going to move. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since you don't know where the computer is going to move to, it's difficult to actually position your units to collide with them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot [of] times, you know, I'm just walking right past enemy units. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The majority of the battle scenes consist of you and the enemy simply chasing each other around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can see this goin' on, right here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Plus, these battles are [pretty] long and drawn out and involve a lot of, sort of, randomly chasing around. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I could be completely misunderstanding the point [of] this game, but I suspect this is just a very primitive, poorly-thought-out Military Tactics Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ballblazer 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 04 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by LucasFilm Games 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's an oddity from Pony Canyon, Lucasfilm Games? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! It's a FamiCom version of "Ballblazer"! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It's] not something I would expect to see released on this console, but it came out for every other system at the time, so why not? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One intriguing addition is this intro, which shows you how the game works from a traditional three-quarters view perspective. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For those not familiar with "Ballblazer", it was, in fact, the first game released from the brand-new Lucasfilm Games studio. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first version was for the Atari 800 computer in 1984. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] fast-paced 3D game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's sorta like Soccer, [only] played by these landspeeder-like ships. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object is to grab the ball and shoot it through a set of moving goalposts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The screen shows ya the viewpoints of both ships at all times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see here, it is a reasonably fast-paced game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the FamiCom version again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously it doesn't look quite as smooth as the original. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The nice straight lines, from the Atari Computer version, have been replaced with these blocky jaggy-looking things. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For those of you who've never played "Ballblazer", it might look, uh, kinda like pure chaos. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What exactly is goin' on? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well it definitely does take some getting used to. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing about the controls: Your ship automatically turns to face the ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You use the B... -- D-Pad to slide to left or right or forward and backward. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But rotating to change directions just sorta happens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thus if the ball is moving around a lot, you'll find yourself, sort of, like, sort of, flipping directions kind of confusingly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ballblazer" certainly has its fans, but seems more of a demo or a warm-up for Lucasfilm Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 ([It's] not exactly "Monkey Island"; that's for sure.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One problem I kept encountering was when both ships would tend to, sort of, end at 90 degree angle towards each other, with the ball in the middle, trying to push it their different directions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Eventually, you can just, sort of, end up in a corner in a stalemate. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I'm not really a fan of the game, so there's probably some sorta way around this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Overall it seems like a [pretty] minor release. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, Activision's name is featured prominently on the cover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They released a few ports, such as the, uh, Commodore 64 version, and I assume Pony Canyon had a license of the game from them. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 A Brief History of Taito ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Before we get into our next game, "Arkanoid II" from Taito, I thought we'd briefly take a look at the history of this company, being one of the longest-lasting video game makers, though one that has seen a slow decline in their fortunes after (at one time) being about the biggest video game company in existence. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like Sega, Taito was founded by a non-native of Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, Michael Kogan, a Russian Jew who fled Russia to China, then moved to Japan in 1939. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is, I believe, a picture of the young Mr. Kogan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1953 he founded the Taito trading company in the Minato division of Tokyo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This particular area is heavily populated with businesses and manufacturing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taito was originally set up to sell vodka in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By 1956 Taito had branched out to sales of amusement equipment and jukeboxes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in the 1960s, they were the sole source, in Japan, of the Seeburg jukeboxes, from the U.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then in 1971, Taito purchased another company, called Japan Vending Machines and got deeper into the Amusement Machine business. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Finally, in 1972, Taito changed its name to Taito Corporation and manufactured its first video Arcade Games in 1973 (supposedly the first in Japan). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first game was either "ela Pong" or "Soccer" (depending on the source). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, they're both clones of Atari's "Pong", which came out the year prior. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most of Taito's early games were designed by a young man named Tomohiro Nishikado, who's really the father of Japanese video game design, and perhaps the single person most responsible for Taito's initial success. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1975 Taito's games began making their way overseas, when "Western Gun" was redesigned by Nutting (the same company that released "Space Wars" - the first Arcade video game) and then distributed in the U.S. by Midway, under the name "Gunfight". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Through Midway, Taito suddenly had a distributer of games in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taito's early games were all [pretty] typical of the era - simple black and white affairs, often with Sports or Military themes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, they were the veterans in the relatively young videogame field. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By 1978, they'd been making games for five years. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, that was the year that everything changed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1978, Arcade Games went from being a reasonably popular curiosity to a nationwide mania, all due to one game: "Space Invaders". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, "Space Invaders" was the medium's breakthrough hit - so popular in Japan that it supposedly caused 100 Yen coin shortage and resulted in video arcades sprouting up everywhere in Japan and the United States. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even though Taito's immediate follow-up, "Lunar Rescue" was not as successful, "Space Invaders" allowed Taito to expand and even set up operations in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the time being, they were at the top of the pile. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Over the next few years, Taito continued to crank out the hits. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Qix" was a highly original Puzzle Game and one that's been copied countless times over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the early 1980s, Taito games were all over the arcades, including such hits as "Zoo Keeper" from 1982, and "Elevator Action" from 1983, as well as various games we've seen in their FamiCom incarnations, "Legend of Kage", "Arkanoid", "Bubble Bobble" as well as more obscure games like the proto-Fighting Game, "Typhoon Gal", early Beat-'em-Ups like "Knuckle Joe", Shooters such as "Tiger-Heli", or in 1986 the ultra widescreen Arcade Shooter "Darius". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The 'Darius' series (sort of Taito's answer to "Gradius") featured a special custom cabinet with a wide monitor and a weird underwater theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the mid-1980s, Taito continued to make successful games, such as the Hack-'n'-Slash "Rastan", "Double Dragon", and the exciting Car Chase Game "Chase HQ", so they were still reasonably successful, at this point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, at the same time, the Nintendo Entertainment System was overshadowing Arcade gaming. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taito, for whatever reason, never fully got on the console bandwagon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They ported many of their Arcade hits, but they never really had a breakthrough hit for the consoles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, they did release some fine original titles, but they are often a bit underlooked. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Little Samson" for the N.E.S. is a little-known late period game for the system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Power Blazer" is perhaps their most beloved original N.E.S. title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it was a decent size hit, but Taito (for whatever reason) never really developed it into a franchise. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Legend the Black Manta", released by Taito in the U.S. also had a bit of a following. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the 16-bit era, they did branch out a bit - even trying their hand at R.P.G.s., like with the 'Lufia' series for the Super Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another series that never quite took off, but did have games coming out until the GBA era. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Darius Force" was one of a few console-exclusive games in the 'Darius' series, but doesn't really stack up with the best of the Super Nintendo Shooters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the most part, Taito stuck with what it knew best in the 1990s - making Arcade Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After the success of "Bubble Bobble", they came to sorta specialize in cute Arcade Platformers, like "...New Zealand Story" and "Parasol Stars". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both were great games had some fine console ports. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, they continue to milk the 'Bubble Bobble' games the best they could, releasing all sorts of sequels and spin-off games - [pretty] much up to the very current day. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A number of interesting Taito games were being released in arcades. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, the oddball animal rights-themed Beat-'em-Up, "Growl", which is well -- well-remembered for its general insanity. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even weirder was "Puli rula" - a genuinely surreal Beat-'em-Up that remains one of Taito's most underappreciated Arcade Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taito had released some Shoot-'em-Ups back in the 1980s and continued to do so in the next decade. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But while the 'Darius' games and the 'Ray Force' games were [pretty] decent, Taito found themselves eventually, sort of, being overshadowed by other companies in this particular area. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The same is true with Fighting Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Street Fighter", "Mortal Kombat", "Fatal Fury", "Tekken", "Virtua Fighter". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There were so many popular Fighting Games at the time, but Taito missed out on that particular money train as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Speaking of money trains, what probably did Taito going through the lean years was this one, "Densha de Go!" a Train Simulation Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A huge hit in Japan, Taito pumped out tons of games in this series, before finally shutting it down in 1997. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, the '90s were really not that kind to Taito, with their U.S. offices being closed in 1995, their attempt to release a C.D.-ROM console about that time also failing... 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, Taito was purchased outright by Square Enix in 2006. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, today's Taito still manages to put out a lot [of] product. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Japan, they make fancy Arcade Games as well as a lot of non-video game related product (like redemption games, karaoke, and whatnot). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Their profile has been raised quite a bit recently, due to the success with such games as "Space Invaders Extreme" and, in Japan, the 'Cooking Mama' series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, quite frankly, at this point, Taito seems to be mostly releasing new variations on its classic games like "Arkanoid", "Bubble Bobble", and whatnot - often for portable platforms, cell phones, WiiWare, and the ilk. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Will they ever really be a major player again? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's hard to say. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, for the moment, let's just go ahead and go back to 1988. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Arkanoid II 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 08 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last time, we saw the bizarre and abyssmal "Replicart" from Taito. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now we have "Arkanoid II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's quite a step up! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note, there's a few different modes here, including an Edit Mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the game starts in a rather creative fashion, with you replaying the final battle from the first game (sorta like "Symphony of the Night"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You relive the struction of DOH ("Arkanoid"'s main boss) and then they add a little text scroll appears explaining that DOH reappears at some point in the future and now you've gotta defeat him again, though it doesn't really give much explanation for this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, of course, DOH must be one of the most unfortunately named video game bosses ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, remember that "Arkanoid" came out well before 'The Simpsons' did, so you really can't blame Taito for this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But still, it might actually kinda mind you of 'Play Doh', I suppose, if not 'The Simpsons'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, there's the whole plot, explained, right there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One, sort of, odd thing about "Arkanoid II" (as we'll see in a moment) - there's actually a second title screen coming up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, after all the introductory hoo-ha, you're back, uh, to level after level of destroying bricks! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This introduces silver blocks that are destructible but will actually reappear after a little while. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, as you might recall, "Arkanoid II" originally come out in Arcades in 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The 'Arkanoid' games were one of Taito's m...8 -- mid-'80s Arcade hits, along with, of course, "Bubble Bobble". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, they didn't really follow up with a sequel until years later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom version is [pretty] faithful to the Arcade original, aside from a reduction in the number of colors. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the main novelty introduced in "Arkanoid II" was that, after beating a level, you can exit to the left or the right, and this will take you to different levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, in Level 1, you can go left or right; I think it'll even... either Levels 2 or 3. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You c... -- So you can, sort of, choose your own path, throughout the game, which you'll have to play [only] half of the 64 levels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, as before, various power-ups can be bought, uh, the e... -- ever-helpful laser, for example, as well as, like, a power-up that'll, like, make your ship wider, one that'll let you exit the level before you've blown up all the blocks, extra lives, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, once again, this is compatible with the special "Arkanoid" rotary controller for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As before, this is really the [only] way to play the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Using the D-Pad is not recommended. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Here's the level editor mentioned earlier.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, all in all, "Arkanoid [II]"'s a [pretty] high-quality port from Taito (probably the best since "Bubble Bobble"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I've noted in the past, Taito definitely seems to be, sort of, lagging when it comes to creating great original games for the system. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Predator 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 10 🇯🇵 // 1989 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by KLON 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pack-in-Video 🇯🇵 // Activision 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey! It's more crap from Pack in Video! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They are, sort of, turning out to be the Japanese LJN. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you might recall, they were originally in the film distribution business, so they had all kinds of ties to film studios. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hence we get games like "Predator". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first game we saw from them was "Rambo". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, member... that -- remember that was the game where Rambo fights giant spiders? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Predator" is sorta like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, so far this doesn't seem that bad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I assume you remember "Predator", right? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The 1987 movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, and almost featuring Jean Claude Van Damme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alien kills humans "...Most Dangerous Game"-style, but messes with the wrong guy (in this case, Arnold Schwarzenegger). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, these nice little introductory illustrations here set up the plot from the movie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 From time to time, another non-animated cutscene will appear and move the story forward - probably a good thing, because the game itself has [pretty] much no connection to the movie whatsoever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can play a few levels of this and have no idea you were playing game based on "Predator". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, one interesting thing is: Take a look at the covers of the box art. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is one of those rare instances where they got a really awful, uh, box art in Japan but I guess a semi-decent one in the United States. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, this is one case where we actually lucked out in that department. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the obvious concerns here arise. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shouldn't be wearing some sort of like camouflage or military green outfit, as opposed to, like, a pink leotard? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, as you find out quite quickly, most enemies are too small for ya to hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you -- when you crouch, you can't punch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, as a result, you do, sort of, have to mostly jump over enemies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This does actually look quite a bit like "Rambo", uh, doesn't it? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well anyways, the levels are [pretty] straightforward, uh, side-scrolling deals. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You can sometimes go up or down as well, but it's nowhere near as confusing and nonlinear as "Rambo". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The levels all seemed end in a door. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there is a bit of jumping involved; and it'll take a while to get used to the slippery surfaces that seem to, uh, you know, be covering everything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, as the game progresses, you'll start to encounter more irritations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya climb this little hill and... somehow you sorta fall right through? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, there are many parts where ya can walk right through walls and fall to your doom! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, you know, it's not really easy to see exactly which parts are solid and which parts are not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thus, you have to be really careful where you land when you jump. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, right here, for example, I'll just pick up that life refill and... Whoa! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, come on - that's ridiculous! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How can I fall through the ground just because there's a little hill? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, eventually we'll pick up a gun; here I've got the laser but be careful! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game loves taking stuff away from you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That little hand icon there will switch your weapon back to the bare fist. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So very cautiously slip beneath it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, you're thinkin', 'Well, you've got some weapons, so things will, uh, improve a bit. I can actually shoot enemies for a change.'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, as soon as you start the next level... no laser! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! That's right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your weapons will actually disappear each new level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, to add insult to injury, the game gives you these absolutely worthless grenades. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Almost impossible to hit anything with these and they have absolutely no blast radius, whatsoever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And something else you might encounter in this game is you will be attacked by killer butterflies, just like the "Rambo" game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, at the end of this level, you'll actually encounter the Predator, himself, and engage in a ver... -- very, sort of, stupid little battle, where he jumps around 'n' does cannonballs in midair. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, this is [pretty] lame but, believe it or not, it actually does get worse. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After every so many levels, you'll have a level called Big Mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, that's right! Big Mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everything in this game gets bigger and uglier in these modes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are these, uh, forced-scrolling sections where you need to shoot or avoid these bubbles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the end, you'll face the Predator again, who attacks you by sending a group of small Predator heads at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seriously! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then, after you've come -- killed him, you go back to the jungle; altogether there's about 30 stages. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... If you think, 'Hey! The Predator is kinda hard to see there.', he's not actually, um, blinking out due to, like, problems with the, uh -- the sprite flicker. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's actually invisible most [of] the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, this is a [pretty] terrible game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The developer KLON had been linked to this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Their name was also on "Replicart" from last episode, so KLON looks like someone to definitely avoid. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nazoler Land Dai 3 Gou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sunsoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, no, no no no no. Not another 'Nazoler Land' game from Sunsoft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is, of course, the series of magazine video games, each containing a handful of minigames. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least they're putting some effort into their menu screens; these little scrolls unfurl whenever you make a selection. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But beyond this, what we have here is the standard array of little games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There's, sort of, a quiz, some games/Board Game (getting the questions right what is the car around the track). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And why do Japanese games have so many girls in the bunny suits? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is that, like, a real thing in Japan or just based on some weird misconception about American society? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another weird little Platform Game with this girl again. I recall seeing her in one of the earlier games in the series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I do like the music, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, let's not forget the Bingo number generator. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] not sure why there needs to be so many of these things for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even if Bingo is a popular game to play in the home, I mean, they're, like, 'Hey! Let's play Bingo!'. 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Sure! I'll get out my video game console.'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know why that guy jumps around so crazy whenever you get a Bingo number. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and let's not forget, uh, the very last thing here - the -- the mailbag. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, at least this is the final game in the series. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the next Sunsoft game released in Japan was... "Blaster Master". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, there you go; we're gonna see some improvements. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tsurikichi Sampei: Blue Marlin Hen 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 17 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Victor Interactive 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so we've got a kid wearing a cowboy hat and a lei, holding an oversized shotgun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Cool! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, actually really it's just a fishing pole. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Tsurikichi Sampei: Blue Marlin Hen" from Victor Interactive, a game based on... a manga and anime! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, the original manga was by Takawa Yaguchi which came out in the early 1970s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then an animated T.V. series hit the airwaves in the early '80s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think it was off the air by the time this game came out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, you start by entering your name, though you don't actually name the character; you name the boat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, as you may have gathered, "Tsurikichi Sampei..." (Fisherman Sampei) is about fishing! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the second FamiCom Fishing Game we've seen ("The Black Bass" being the other one). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And so, ya head out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's a big deal since they set off fireworks as your ship leaves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you decide where you wanna fish. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I assume that a fish icon, uh, appears in the square. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whenever that happens, that means it's a good place to stop. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! There's one now. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the fishing action begins. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you've gotta choose your bait, I believe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you've got the correct setup for the kind of fish in that area, ya wait a bit! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like most Fishing Games, this isn't really thrilling stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, as it turns out, this wasn't the [only] 'Fishermen Sampei' game to be released. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, first of all, there was an [M.S.X.] version of this same game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really sure which came out first, but next year there was an M.S.X.-[only] sequel, which is actually a [pretty] nice-looking game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I like the colors on this one! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it does seem, uh, to actually resemble "The Black Bass" quite a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It goes for a side-view, where you can actually see the sea life crawling around underneath the ocean. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then, a few years down the road, another 'Tsurikichi Sampei' game was released by Bandai for the PlayStation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was in the 'Symbol Character 2000' series, which also had a bunch of 'Gundam' games, a 'Kamen Rider' game, and even a 'High School Kimen Gumi' game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] basic Fishing Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But look at that! There's an easily understandable mechanic for catching your fish! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 ([That's] something that is absent from the FamiCom game)! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to wear the fish down without breaking your line. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, hell yeah! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I caught a fish! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 ([That's] something I couldn't do in the FamiCom game because they couldn't really figure out the control scheme). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think you're supposed to, like, sort of, get the two [arrows] at the top there, over on one side - or get 'em far apart or something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... Sadly, nothing I really did on the controller seemed to have any recognizable effect on that gauge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I guess this game is going to have to remain a bit of a mystery. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 ([It's] no loss, I'm sure). 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Napoleon Senki 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Lenar 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, just about two weeks after "19", we have our second Military Tactics Game, "Napoleon Senki", which is often referred to as "Battles of Napoleon" (though, nowadays, I suppose it would be translated as 'Record of the Napoleonic Wars', if similar game titles are any indication). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we've got the Marseillaise playing over the title screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the way, the Marseillaise was actually banned by Napoleon, so perhaps it's not the most appropriate piece of music to have associated with this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Napoleon Senki" was published by Irem, who we last saw with "[Guardic] Gaiden" (a.k.a. "The Guardian Legend"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That game, of course, was from Compile, but this one is (sadly) by Lenar - the same folks behind "Deadly Towers" (which was notable for being called the worst N.E.S. game ever by Seanbaby) and also "Bird Week" (that weird game where you control the mother bird looking for food for her chicks). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By most standards, this a [pretty] typical Military Simulation Game - perhaps a bit more interesting than "19". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya choose from a few different play options and then you'll, sort of, follow the path of Napoleon's career, beginning with this Italian scenario (presumably you are battling the Austrians here). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there are two types of, uh, soldiers on the battlefield. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The ones with the brown hats and white pants are the enemies and the other guys (the ones are the white hats) eh, are actually potential allies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can get them to join you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously you'll want to grab them in order to enlarge your own army. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (That's you with the, uh, blue hats and white pants, there.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, we probably don't really wanna call this a Real-Time Strategy Game, per se. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not exactly "Age of Empires", but I suppose it could be considered to be a very simple Real-Time Tactics Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both you and the enemy troops are moving at all times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You control the direction your troops are moving by placing the cursor above them, then they'll start moving in the direction the cursor indicates ([a] rather odd system, to be sure). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] need to, sort of, be mindful of where your guys are going; otherwise, they might end up off the edge of the map or something, if you don't really pay attention. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here I'm going to encounter some neutral troops and they will... join my army. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's what occurring, right here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, when you encounter an actual enemy, you will then have to fight a battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here are the enemy brown soldiers wandering around, right there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And... here we go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it'll start by showing you the details of the forces involved (infantry, cavalry, and so on). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (This actually doesn't really look good for... my team.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it gives you two battle options. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The 'Manual' option will let ya play, sort of, like, a real-time battle sequence. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First, ya need to, sort of, choose your formation and then both sides line up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it controls much like it does on the main map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you all your forces, sort of, arrayed it kinda gives ya, like, a -- like, a wide view of the, uh -- the overall, uh, battlefield, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya have your cannons, which can blow big holes in the enemy's armies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this all involves quite a bit of micromanaging, 'cause there's, like, a lot of troops moving around at all times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One way you can actually win is simply by killing the enemy's general; that will, sort of, win you automatically. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I will say one thing is that "Napoleon Senki" actually does, sorta, give you a decent-sized army, so it's not like where you're -- you know, "19" when you have, like, eight units. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya actually, sort of, feel like you're controlling, like, vast military forces, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, if all this is not your thing, you can choose the other battle option, which is like an automated battle (presumably utilizing, like, random dice rolls or something like that). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... If you do that, you know, basically, the battle will just, sort of, play out automatically. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you'll see re... -- the results in just a few seconds. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Napoleon Senki" seems like a reasonably well-put-together game, even though it's, you know, crude by today's standards. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One bit of possible confusion - the Wikipedia entry for "Napoleon Senki" seems to confuse it with another game called "Le Emperor", implying that these are, uh, actually two names for the same game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, Koei's "Le Emperor" is a more sophisticated game based on the same subject matter, but they are definitely different games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nobunaga no Yabou: Zenkokuban 🇯🇵 // Nobunaga's Ambition 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 18 🇯🇵 // 1989 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Koei 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Koei 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now we have our big Military Strategy Game "Nobunaga no Yabou" or "Nobunaga's Ambition" from Koei. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the first game we've seen from Koei - and thus their first console game (though they have been making games for computers for a few years). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now right away, we get some, uh, menus here, ask you for a number of players, difficulty, and (of course) which Daimyo you wanna play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some are a lot better than others; that's for sure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's go the man, himself, Oda Nobunaga. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Technically you are choosing the stats for your territory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The stats for your feudal lord (or daimyo) are chosen randomly, though you can keep generating new random stats, if you don't like the results. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, at this point, you may be asking, 'Hey, just Who is this Oda Nobunaga guy?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, let's take a super quick look at the history of medieval Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the turn of the first millennium, Japan had been ruled for some time by an emperor and the Emperor's court. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All this changed in the 12th century when a civil war broke out between the two powerful clans, the Genji and the Tyra. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Genpei War ended with the head of the Genji clan, Minamoto Yoritomo, defeating his rivals and establishing myself as the de facto ruler of Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yoritomo was the first Shogun (sort of a military dictator). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Shoguns held onto their power for a couple hundred years, successfully defending Japan from its first overseas invasion by the Mongols in the 13th century. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After another civil war and the rise of powerful feudal lords known as the daimyo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The shogunate had [pretty] much collapsed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This time period is known as the 'Sengoku Era' (or 'Warring States period'). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Japan lacks any, sort of, real central leadership. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oda Nobunaga was one such Lord. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Through a series of conquests and military alliances, he managed to control a [pretty] big chunk of the country. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He was betrayed by one of his [own] generals in 1582, but he got the ball rolling. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Finally, another Daimyo, Tokugawa Ieyasu, succeeded in completely reunifying Japan and set himself up as Shogun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Tokugawa Shogunate (or the Edo period of Japan) lasted until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Prior to the FamiCom version, "Nobunaga's Ambition" was released for Japanese computers in 1986 (though some sources say 1983, which seems unlikely). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom version seems to be [pretty] faithful to the Computer version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the U.S. release seems to be [pretty] faithful to the original Japanese game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here's the main map screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a turn-based game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we'll give you a lowdown on, sort of, what the other daimyo are doing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Generally, they will immediately start by invading some other territory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There will always be little animations for various events, be it plagues, typhoons, or battles occurring between the miscellaneous fiefs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This screen also gives you the going rates for various things that you can buy and sell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object of the game is to, of course, you know, take over the entire map of Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One guy has already been killed, as we can see, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now let's go to the screen where ya actually issue your commands. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As mentioned, this is a Strategy Game, not a strict Military Tactics Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can make pacts, improve your cities, raise taxes, sell rice, all sorts of stuff! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can [only] perform one action per turn, more or less. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What I'm doing here is I'm actually going to use, uh, the 'Grow' which will increase my city's output. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whenever you do so, I guess you have to decide how much money you actually wanna spend towards making improvements. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will cause my output to go up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But be careful, because growing your cities too quickly or raising taxes - these kinda things will cause your morale to drop; in theory, this could start a riot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another fun thing to do is to hire ninjas to assassinate other daimyos. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the most awesome animation in the game, right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He not [only] stabs the guy in the groin, but sorta wiggles the sword around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you are successful in your assassination, you can then bid on the fief. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is risky because losing a bid will mean someone else [will] take control of the fief, basically after you footed the bill for the ninjas. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I kind of bid low on this one and got lucky and ended up... taking control of fief 13. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, ninjas frequently fail in their missions to assassinate, so it's really, sort of, uh, a shot in the dark. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each fief [has] its own, sor... -- sort of, separate stats and money. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya get money by selling extra rice, but one annoying thing: you can [only] buy and sell stuff if the merchant is in your area that turn. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you're low on cash and need it for troops or whatever, you have to wait for the merchant to swing by. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this can cause serious problems. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we just sold a bunch of rice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other things you'll be doing with the money is buying better arms for your men, hiring soldiers, that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, at some point, either you'll invade someone else's fief for someone'll attack you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you'll enter into the battle section of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, what I'm doing here, by the way, is training my men to increase their skill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is actually very important! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The nice thing about training is it doesn't require any money. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, as I was mentioning, the battles here are 100% turn-based. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Basically, you move all your units and then the enemy will move his. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya get to choose wherever you wanna place your units. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If the Daimyo's killed, then it's Game Over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The battles seem to be determined by luck, as well as stats. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, as your arm is -- army's training and the actual train that they're on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can place troops on the hills but not on the mountains. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems that, uh, Defense tends to, uh, do a little bit better than Offense. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems to be best to, sort of, wait 'til enemies attack you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, obviously, "Nobunaga's Ambition" is a [pretty] impressive game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, for Nintendo owners in the U.S., one of the first opportunities to, sort of, play something very much like a P.C. game on a console. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Strategy Games have been around on -- a long time on Computers, but you wouldn't really think the genre would work on the Nintendo Entertainment System. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But yet, here it is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This goes to show that Koei had quite a bit of ambition, themselves, to have set up a U.S. branch in 1988 and work on getting a game like this translated and out in the U.S. by 1989. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game was, of course, a huge hit, and led to zillions of sequels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is actually a [pretty] impressive debut from Koei. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fighting Golf 🇯🇵 // Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 24 🇯🇵 // 1988 September [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SNK 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by SNK 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I have a bit [of] criticism with this title screen, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The red splash at the bottom, along with the name "Fighting Golf" makes it appear that someone just got their skull smashed in by the guy with golf club. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wouldn't green have been a better color? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is supposed to be grass, right? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, is it my imagination, or has it been a while since we've seen a game from SNK? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think the last one published by them was A... -- was "Athena", which was almost a year ago. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, "Fighting Golf" is a Golf Game - one lets you choose from a few different characters, in(uh)cluding, someone named 'Big Jumbo' (obviously inspired by Jumbo Ozaki) who got his own official Golf Game last episode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this was also released in the U.S., but there are a few differences between the versions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... First of all, note, this is a home version of a... [pretty] recent contemporary Arcade Game (one known in the West as "Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade Game come out in 1988, so this was another case of an Arcade and a home version coming out at about the same time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Were you to compare these two versions [of] the game, you'd see they're actually [pretty] similar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, the Arcade version has, uh, crisper colors and sound, nut it's a [pretty] faithful reproduction. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, as you might gather, this officially features the name and likeness of Lee Trevino, uh, he was a very successful golfer in the 1970s and was also notable for being perhaps the first famous Mexican American golfer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, for the N.E.S. version, the game was released under the name, "Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Trevino is one of the playable characters - listed there as 'Super Mex'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And no, that's not some weird bit of Japanese craziness. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Super Mex' is Trevino's actual real-life nickname. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If 'Miracle Chosuke' is based on any real golfer, I have no idea who. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game works a lot like any other Golf Game, the main innovation being that the different golfers have different strengths and weaknesses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eri (or Amy, for example) ha... -- has a slower moving Power Meter, so it's easier to hit the ball at exactly the right time (you know, right when it's below the arrow). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than that, you have [pretty] much the same stuff as every other Golf Game we've seen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a Japan and U.S. course. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japan course seems to be a bit harder, of the two. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's all these quite crazy water traps and whatnot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, this thing is, like, (what? maybe) the seventh Golf Game we've seen for the FamiCom (plus two for the Master System). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And most [of] these games are almost identical to each other! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just a small variation on the same formula, but the formula is really getting tired! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's clear that there's some sort of mania for Golf Games in Japan, but I wish that the next game we'd see would maybe switch up the formula just a little bit. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Omoikkiri Tanteidan Haado Gumi: Matenrou no Chousenjou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, folks, once again, it's that time - and by 'that time', I mean time for an off-the-wall game, based on some obscure Japanese T.V. show. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, it's "Omoikkiri Tanteidan Haado Gumi". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was the 1987 entry in the long-running series, called the Toei Fushugi Comedy Series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It concerns a group [of] school kids and a mysterious criminal who wears this creepy gold "V for Vendetta"-like mask! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually [pretty] frightening looking! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm gonna put this into what I call the '"Paris Dakar Rally" school of game design'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much like that horrible little game, there are a couple completely extraneous minigames tacked on to the beginning. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start off with a simple memory game, involving cards with the pictures of the show's various characters on them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thrilling stuff! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After that, you move on to a [pretty] pointless "Kaboom!"-like game, in which you catch roses thrown by the villain. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe he gets around in a hot air balloon; that's what he's hanging off of, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So once you've got all that done, you move on to the title screen again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the real game begins. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, what's the real game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's a side-view Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If I were to make a comparison, I'd say it feels like "...Goonies II" meets Kemco's "Superman" (though it's clearly better-looking than "Superman"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think you're trying to find some sort of treasure that was stolen by Mr. Gold Mask. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya shoot bad guys on the main street level, enter buildings, talk to N.P.C.s, ... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya have some basic inventory items, at the top right there (including a slingshot = much like "...Goonies II"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this, sort of, game design was actually [pretty] common at the time, more so in Japan than -- than in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose, you know, this game actually looks halfway decent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've s... -- certainly seen, uh, much worse-looking games on 'Chrontendo'; that's for sure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? This could actually be an undiscovered gem, but I somehow very much doubt it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, now that we've got this episode's Bandai game out [of] the way, we'll move on to the last couple [of] games this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Wardner no Mori 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Toaplan | Taito 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright! We have another one here from Taito, "Wardner no Mori", once again an F.D.S. game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The decision to put this game on the F.D.S., I feel, was the wrong one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll discuss that in just a moment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a little animated intro, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And ah! Ugly! So ugly! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This thing is really putrid-looking! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What were they thinking? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A real shame, considering the port was actually [of] a [pretty] nice-looking Arcade Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, let's compare this to the original intro. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whenever a robed and hooded gentleman asks you to join him on a "fantasia", don't do it! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, he turns your girlfriend into a crystal ball. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, this is the original Arcade version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We saw this game in 'Chrontendo' "1987 Arcade Round-Up" - a decent little "Ghosts 'n Goblins"-style Platformer, developed by Toaplan and manufactured by Taito. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., it was called "Pyros" for some reason (maybe because you shoot fireballs). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's got an additional background layer, as you can see ([it's a] nice looking game!). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Too bad the FamiCom port turned out so crude and primitive looking. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, some minor changes have been made. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade Game was one of the, uh, you know, one-hit-kill variety - and here you have a Life Bar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, the game is not that easy! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Part of it has to do with the old-school clunky jumping and physics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have a certain amount of control over your jump, but it still handles far more awkwardly than "Super Mario Bros." or "Contra". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The weird jumping leads to some... unpleasant moments. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like here, for example! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In order to cross this fire pit (you sorta need to jump from vine to vine), you'll need to be at the very bottom end [of] the vine when you make your jump, simply because you jump so high up in the air! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you figure it out, it's still not that hard! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, the first time you play it, you're gonna land in the fire pit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (And I ended up missing a jump anyway.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the end of each level, there's a little shop where you can buy, sort of, like, a weapons upgrade, plus (more importantly) health refills. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the [only] way to refill your health in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this was not the [only] port of "Wardner...". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1990, it was released for the Sega Mega drive (or Genesis), but not by Taito, themselves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This version is more faithful to the original, in both graphics and gameplay, but still looks [pretty] ugly and doesn't really handle that well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess "Wardner..." never really got, like, a definitive home version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 ...which is a bit of a shame, 'cause, like I said, it actually seems like a [pretty] decent Arcade Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, going back to FamiCom, the difficulty ramps up a bit on the second level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to avoid all sorts of, uh, irritating spiky death traps. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This isn't exactly "Ninja Gaiden"-tough, but it can be frustrating! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's, uh, quite a bit harder than "Castlevania", for example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of the jumps require precise timing to avoid taking a hit (like there, when you sorta have to jump through those, uh -- those spiky crusher things). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 These things actually take quite a bit of practice to avoid taking some damage when, uh, you know, jumping on these things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... Add in some fast-moving blades coming at your head (often at the same time as flying enemies) and this level does get a bit hairy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the end of each level, there's a boss of sorts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a -- a gray dragon, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After seeing the bosses in various Konami games or "Mega Man", this guy seems [pretty] disappointing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's still a bit of pain, since your fireballs have [pretty] much no range, so you have to get up, like, really close to hit him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, it turns out that Princess actually is a monster, so you have to blast her, as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I found myself [pretty] disappointed with the home release of "Wardner...", uh, since I really felt the game had potential. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If Taito had maybe tightened up the controls a bit [and] added some extra stuff this could have been a really cool game! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, even aside from the controls, putting the game on the Disk System was kind of a bad idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The disks were just too small, for one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, you couldn't add in extra RAM chips, like ya could on cartridges. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Comparing "Wardner" to Konami's port of "Contra" just shows just how far short Taito fell, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Contra" proves that with some work, you can take a cutting-edge Arcade Game and turn it into a great FamiCom game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Wardner"'s outdated-looking graphics just completely lack the charm of the [Arcade] original's. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If the gameplay had been improved, that would have made a -- made up for the game's ugliness. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As it stands, the results are [pretty] disappointing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not saying it's a bad game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Wardner"'s way better than all the terrible kusoge Platformers we've seen, but it certainly could have been a lot better. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Golgo 13: Kamigami no Tasogare 🇯🇵 // Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 March 26 🇯🇵 // 1988 September [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by VIC TOKAI 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by VIC TOKAI 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our last game this episode and one which has (quite unexpectedly) one of the most stylish introductions we've seen, so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Considering how the first two VIC TOKAI games were sorta lame (remember "Chester Field"?), it's a bit surprising that "Golgo 13..." starts off so confidently. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We were virtually in "Ninja Gaiden" territory, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is a rather convoluted plot, which is explained entirely in cutscenes and dialogue. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It involves the CIA, the KGB, some mysterious criminal organization, and biological weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. version is called "Top Secret Episode", the original Japanese subtitle was more dramatic-sounding: "...Twilight of the Gods". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A few changes have been made, namely the main bad guys in the Japanese version were Nazis. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the U.S. release, they're simply a generic bunch of, uh, criminals in a syndicate, or something like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this game is, uh, based on the very famous and long-lived 'Gogol 13' series of manga, anime, and movies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Golgo 13" (a.k.a. Duke Togo) is some sort of super assassin/tough guy/chick magnet/anti-hero. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The fact that he's a professional hitman was, sort of, glossed over in the U.S. release of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As good as the production values on display here are, I wish the game itself were a bit better. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The actual gameplay is much less impressive than all the window dressing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's the complaint people, uh, have a lot about games today, but it was true back even in the 1980s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All the dialogue and cutscenes are connected together with a variety of Action sequences, usually of the side-scrolling variety. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They often just amount to, 'Walk several screens and enter a building.'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the mechanics are quite janky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like in "Predator", you can't duck and attack at the same time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Meaning you definitely have to jump over enemy bullets, and then try to shoot them from behind.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, it is difficult to control your jumps and I often found myself landing right on enemies, which is, uh -- rather illogically damages you but not them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Seriously! Try this in real life and see who comes out for the worse, uh, the guy who gets jumped on or the guy who does jumping.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now far more fun than these sequences, are the ones that involve the first-person shooting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have one, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These handle [pretty] well and, despite the fact that people are shooting at you, this is actually an opportunity to regain some health, since killing guys will, sort of, recharge your Life Bar. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Golgo 13..." is one of those 'throw in everything but the kitchen sink' games, and there is a surprising variety in the action sequences, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not all walking around and shooting people. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, we have a brief helicopter Shoot-'em-Up sequence. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, since it's so easy to get hit - and the bad guys take a lot of bolts to destroy - it's a little frustrating. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first time I played this sequence, I actually ran out of bullets and was screwed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, after this, we get perhaps the, uh, second-most famous sequence in the game - one of several unique action set pieces. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to perform an assassination using a sniper rifle from a helicopter! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, how many games, back in 1987, let you use sniper rifles? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which leads me to another point about "Golgo 13...". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It contains a shocking amount of violence and sex for a Nintendo-approved game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As we see here, we are ready to... Boo! Look at that! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actual blood and guts in a Nintendo game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How strange. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'And what's that?', you said, 'sex?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, this is probably the first FamiCom game we've seen where you, sort of, unambiguously get laid in this sequence, right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If there's one thing this game is notorious for today, it's this part. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How did this get past, Nintendo's censors? No idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, laying some pipe does cause your Health Meter to refill. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, after this you'll find yourself traveling to a wide variety of real world locations, including an underwater scuba diving sequence, infiltrating a hidden base, and first-person mazes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While "Golgo 13..." should be highly commended for its excellent integration of story into the game and its huge variety of actch... -- action sequences, not everything is as well done as it should be. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For most folks, I'd say the deal breaker is probably the mazes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will need to navigate several large and generic-looking mazes, full of trapdoors and fake walls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really, the mazes [pretty] much kill any sense of fun in the game, one of the, uh, later mazes in particular is huge and probably kept most gamers from ever actually finishing this thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess I'd say I'm, sort of, of two minds when it comes to "Golgo 13". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It combines innovative concepts, and presentation, and gameplay with some rather knuckleheaded design decisions and awkward mechanics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a lot to admire, but I can't really say I love the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In some ways, it's, uh, the most impressive game this episode but it's also a bit of a missed opportunity. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a bit of a shame, but it definitely holds a unique place in the Nintendo library. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 29 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're not quite done with March yet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next episode we'll finish it up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we'll also have more Military Simulation Games and one game that is considered to be one of the worst N.E.S. games ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not to mention a classic Beat-'em-Up and a weird game from Konami. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, we'll be looking forward to that. 🍇🍌
