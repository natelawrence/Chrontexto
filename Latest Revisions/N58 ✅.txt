👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 58 ✨


💰🍊🍓 Hey, everyone, 🍊 we are here to cover 🍋 the end of March 1990. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 And... hoo boy! 🍊 If you thought last episode 🍋 was a stinker, 🍊 just wait until you 🍋 get a load [of] this one. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 And I'm sorry this episode took 🍋 so long (uh, relatively speaking) 🍊 but I've had a lot going on 🍋 with my personal life 🍊 and I've been trying to get a 🍋 head start on Episodes 59 and 60 🍋 - which are just... both so huge. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 I mean, after those two, 🍋 Episode 61 is gonna be, like, 🍊 just footage of my funeral, 🍋 I suspect. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 (I will have died from playing 🍋 too many 1990 video games.) 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 However, for today we have... 🍋 I don't know - 🍊 Sports Games, 🍋 a couple forgotten J.R.P.G.s, 🍊 some games for little kids, 🍋 some British gaming, and... 🍊 a couple Game Show Games. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 And one of those Game Show Games 🍋 has kind of, like, a weird twist 🍊 - a weird epilogue that 🍋 might get a little rude, 🍊 so make sure ya lock up 🍋 the kids and wives. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Dr. Sparkle on Cinema Oblivia ✨


💰🍊🍓 And {there's} one last thing. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 I made a guest appearance 🍋 on 'Cinema Oblivia' 🍋 (a new podcast from James Eldred) 🍊 where we discuss "Seeds" 🍋 (the 1968 cinematic sleaze-fest 🍋 from cult director Andy Milligan). 🍇

💰🍊🍓 I'll put a link in the comments 🍊 (and also make sure the 🍋 kids are out [of] the room 🍋 while you're listening to it). 🍇

💰🍊🍓 You might know James from 🍋 his appearances on 'Retronauts' 🍊 and from his co-hosting 🍋 the Prog-Rock podcast, 🍊 'Alexander's Ragtime Band' 🍋 with Jeremy Parish. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 You see, kids, these things 🍋 are all, like, interbred; 🍊 you gotta be, like, uh, a member 🍋 of the retro gaming mafia 🍋 to get in on these things. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Dr. Sparkle on Video Game History Hour ✨


💰🍊🍓 And I'm also a guest on the 🍋 'Video Game History Hour' podcast 🍊 - which is the official podcast of 🍋 the Video Game History Foundation. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 You guys probably all know 🍋 Frank and Kelsey. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 And this episode is just a very 🍋 chill hour or so of chatting about 🍋 Chrontendo and related matters. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 There's also a link below 🍋 for this one as well. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 Alright, so let's get started 🍋 in late March 1990. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Majin Eiyuuden Wataru Gaiden 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 March 23 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Westone
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


💰🍊🍓 Alright, let's clean up the last 🍋 [of] the March 1990 games, 🍊 starting with 🍋 "Majin Eiyuuden Wataru Gaiden" 🍋 - an R.P.G. from Hudson. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 As you will recall, Hudson was 🍋 releasing games for both 🍊 the FamiCom and the P.C. Engine 🍋 at the same time. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 And, while the P.C. Engine was 🍋 clearly Hudson's main focus, 🍊 they did occasionally toss out 🍋 an 'Adventure Island' 🍊 or a 'Bomberman' game 🍋 for Nintendo's platform. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 This, however, is an anime game 🍋 developed by WestOne (or WesTone 🍋 - however it's pronounced). 🍇

💰🍊🍓 It's [pretty] obscure, 🍋 but there has been a complete 🍋 English translation done. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 As far as J.R.P.G.s go, 🍋 this is kinda stripped down - 🍊 [I have] no idea what the budget 🍋 or development time was on this 🍊 but it definitely feels like 🍋 a quick cash-in game. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Now, if I told you this game 🍋 is heavily "...Zelda"-influenced 🍊 you'd say, 🍋 'Yeah, cool! That's awesome!'. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Hold on, though; 🍋 I have some bad news. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 This game has a very heavy 🍋 "Zelda II..." influence. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Yeah. Sorry about that. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 Anyway, you do not play as 🍋 the protagonist, Wataru. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Instead, you are some anonymous 🍋 mook who just happened to see 🍋 Wataru get captured, 🍊 and then his robot buddy, 🍋 Ryujinmaru, asked you 🍋 for your help to rescue him. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Naturally, this is done by 🍋 wandering all over the entire 🍋 planet, exploring dungeons, 🍊 and fighting powerful 🍋 enemies every so often 🍊 (which are colloquially 🍋 referred to as 'Bosses'). 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Along the way, you will encounter 🍋 lots of gold and treasure lying around 🍊 and you will need to buy 🍋 weapons for your robot. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 If you're thinkin', 🍋 'Hey this looks like it might 🍋 just be based on an anime.', 🍊 then you are 100% correct. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 'Mashin Hero Wataru' 🍋 was an animated TV series, 🍊 produced by Sunrise, 🍋 which ran from 1988 to 1989 - 🍊 but has been revived 🍋 multiple times, since then. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 The actual cartoon 🍋 looks [pretty] terrible 🍊 but it was apparently [pretty] 🍋 popular in Japan and China. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 This is the second game we've 🍋 seen, based on this series. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 That's right; the first 🍋 was released in 1988 🍋 for the P.C. Engine 🍊 and famously localized 🍋 for the TurboGrafx-16 as 🍋 "Keith Courage in Alpha Zones". 🍇

💰🍊🍓 That game is generally 🍋 considered to not be very good 🍊 and the FamiCom game 🍋 follows in those footsteps. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 Now, don't get me wrong; 🍋 this is not utter trash, 🍊 like last episode's "Sansara Naga". 🍇

💰🍊🍓 It's just... okay. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 I mean, there's a lot [of] 🍋 R.P.G.s for the NES 🍊 and I'm not sure you wanna 🍋 waste your time playing this one. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 Ya start off visiting 🍋 the local village 🍊 (which is so small I don't even 🍋 think it qualifies as a village). 🍇

💰🍊🍓 The locals give you some 🍋 hints about what to do. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 Battles are random and 🍋 are fought almost exactly 🍋 like in "Zelda II...". 🍇

💰🍊🍓 During these battles, 🍋 you actually control the robot 🍋 - not the... the human guy. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 You just stab dudes 🍋 with your dagger. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 Yes, despite being a robot, 🍋 you don't have any guns, 🍋 or lasers, or anything; 🍊 you fight with a dagger. 🍇

💰🍋🍓 And you also have magic spells. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Later enemies will 🍋 be more difficult, 🍊 with the ability to jump, fly, 🍋 or shoot projectiles at ya. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 Before too long, you go into a 🍋 very sparsely designed dungeon. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 And sparsely designed is actually 🍋 a [pretty] good description 🍋 of the entire game. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Obviously, not every R.P.G. 🍋 has the development time 🍋 of "Dragon Quest IV" 🍊 but this game just kinda 🍋 feels... sort of empty. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 The first Boss is defeated 🍋 by making sure you have 🍋 your MP completely full 🍊 and just spamming 🍋 the 'Fire' attack at him. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Your reward is a 'Slip Spell', 🍊 which allows you to escape 🍋 from a battle or from a dungeon. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 Learning magic is odd. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 The spell is placed 🍋 in your inventory, 🍊 then you need to open up your 🍋 items, find the spell, and use it. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 This is what actually 🍋 gives you the magic ability, 🍊 which always has a different name 🍋 than the actual spell item 🍋 that you collected. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 So, for example, using 'Slip Spell' 🍋 will grant you the 'Escape' spell. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 It's weird because ya [only] 🍋 have one party member, 🍊 so... it's not like you can, like, 🍊 pass the spell to 🍋 someone else in your party 🍊 (so that that specific 🍋 character gets the spell). 🍇

💰🍊🍓 I don't know why the spells 🍋 need to be items [to] begin with. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 The screen layout really bugs me. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Obviously, J.R.P.G.s use windows 🍋 when you do things like open 🍋 your inventory or whatever - 🍊 but here there's these two 🍋 large windows that take up, 🍋 like, a third of the screen. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 The right-hand side shows your 🍋 Health, Money, and Magic Points 🍊 while the left just shows you 🍋 the name of the area 🍋 that you're currently in. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 I don't know why this information 🍋 needs [to] be visible 🍋 on the screen at all times. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 Another annoying thing: 🍋 Rather than the background 🍋 smoothly scrolling as you move, 🍊 the Overworld is divided, like, 🍋 into, like, a checkerboard. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Once you reach the edge 🍋 of one of the squares, 🍋 you freeze for a second, 🍊 then the background scrolls 🍋 so that you're in the next square. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 This makes it hard to 🍋 find your way around. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 I had a hard time finding 🍋 the Shop in the Village 🍊 since you actually have to enter 🍋 the specific square on the grid, 🍋 in order to find it. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Also, all the buildings are just 🍋 generic houses that [pretty] much 🍋 look the same from the outside - 🍊 so ya can't really tell an Inn 🍋 from a Weapon Shop. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 The King promises you 🍋 the Princess's hand 🍋 if you defeat 'Tinbot' 🍊 (who isn't even hanging out 🍋 in a dungeon or anything; 🍊 he's just in one [of] the 🍋 houses in this village). 🍇

💰🍊🍓 After you defeat him, 🍋 you'll get a 'Power' spell 🍊 which allows you to move this 🍋 rock that's blocking your way, 🍊 so that you can move on to the 🍋 next area, Icefield. 🍇🍌


💰🍊🍓 Again, this isn't terrible; 🍋 it's just sort of bland and empty. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 I do hate the random battles 🍋 - especially when you have 🍋 jumping or flying enemies. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 Your robot can jump, 🍋 but he can't fly. 🍇

💰🍊🍓 It's apparently quite short; 🍊 a video playthrough [of] 🍋 this I found was [only] 🍋 around 5 hours long, 🍊 so this game is (as you kids 🍋 would say, nowadays) 'Basic'. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Power Soccer 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 March 30 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Arc Kitty Group
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tokuma Shoten 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, we've got a few games 🍋 released on March 30th; 🍊 then we'll wrap up March 🍋 with a few Western releases. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, here's one 🍋 from Tokuma Shoten 🍊 - who, as you recall, is primarily 🍋 a book and magazine publisher 🍊 (who had also diversified into 🍋 music, cartoons, and video games). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Power Soccer" seems to be an 🍋 almost completely forgotten game, 🍋 even in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's also a game that I found 🍋 to be [pretty] unremarkable; 🍊 it is a very generic Soccer Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so let's start 🍋 by choosing our teams. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They have names like 🍋 Eagles, Sharks, Buffalos... 🍋 that kind of stuff. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Choose your formation 🍊 ([I] don't know if this 🍋 makes any difference). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there's basically two 🍋 types of Soccer Games 🍊 - the kind where the field 🍋 is orientated vertically 🍊 - and the kind where the field 🍋 is oriented horizontally 🍊 (such as Nintendo's 🍋 "Soccer" game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For those of you 🍋 who can't see the screen 🍊 (or who are just listening to the 🍋 audio in order to fall asleep) 🍊 let me assure you that, in 🍋 this game the field is vertical. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Controls are very simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One button switches between 🍋 players when playing Defense 🍊 and the other will let you 🍋 try to steal the ball. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When playing Offense one button 🍋 passes the ball to another player 🍊 and the other shoots. 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 That's it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When the guy with the ball 🍋 gets close to the goal, 🍋 the view will zoom in 🍊 and if you're playing Defense 🍋 you will automatically 🍋 take control of the goalie. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The art here is 🍋 actually [pretty] nice. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I like the way the goalie 🍋 falls flat on his face here; 🍋 it's a nice touch. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One funny thing: 🍋 the active players have 🍊 these little white clouds b... 🍋 behind them, as they move. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's how you can tell 🍋 which player is active 🍋 when you switch players. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot [of] games 🍋 will, like, use, like, 🍊 a blinking effect or something 🍋 to designate the active player. 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 This game uses a little cloud. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, to me it looks 🍋 like they're farting 🍊 and that maybe the power 🍋 of their farts is what's 🍋 propelling them forward 🍊 (kind of like how 🍋 a jet plane works?). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was developed by 🍋 a company called Kitty 🍋 (which seems [pretty] obscure). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This whole game is kind of obscure! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There're zero reviews on GameFAQs, 🍊 MobyGames doesn't 🍋 even have an entry for it, 🍊 and there's a relatively small 🍋 number of videos on YouTube. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not bad; it's just sort of 🍋 generic and forgettable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It doesn't qualify as kusoge 🍋 but it's certainly not 🍋 memorable either. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Best Play Pro Yakyuu II 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 March 30 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ASCII
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Every so often, we will 🍋 encounter a game that is 🍋 simply inscrutable to me - 🍊 a game absolutely 🍋 far beyond my ken - 🍊 and the most I can do 🍋 is just show it to you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And today this game is 🍋 "Best Play Pro Yakyuu II" 🍊 - as every online 🍋 source calls it 🍊 (otherwise known as the 🍋 "Best Play Baseball II" 🍊 - as the title screen 🍋 and box art calls it). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Developed and published by ASCII, 🍋 this is a sequel to the 1988 original 🍊 which we undoubtedly 🍋 covered some time ago 🍋 (I can't remember exactly when). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you're probably saying, 🍊 'Wait a second, Dr. Sparkle, 🍋 this is a Baseball Game; 🍊 obviously, this is an easy 🍋 game to understand. 🍊 All FamiCom Baseball Games 🍋 are exactly the same, right?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, usually, 'Yes', 🍊 but this one is a 🍋 Baseball Simulation Game - 🍋 not an Action Baseball Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It mostly involves 🍋 going through Menus, 🍊 making choices about your Roster, 🍋 and having your team play games 🍊 (all of which are 🍋 completely automated; 🍊 you don't control the batter or 🍋 any of the team members directly). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you start by selecting either 🍋 the 'Celery League' 🍋 or the 'Parsley League' 🍊 (which are obviously references 🍋 to the 'Central League' 🍋 and 'Pacific League' 🍊 - two parts of the Japanese 🍋 Major League Baseball system). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The names obliquely 🍋 reference real-life teams. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 C Team is the Carps, 🍋 D Team is the Dragons, 🍋 G the Giants, and so on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are tons of stats for your 🍋 players and lots of options. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This sort of reminds me of 🍋 the Horse Racing Game 🍋 from last episode - 🍊 in that you don't directly 🍋 participate in the game 🍊 (except that "Best Play Baseball" 🍋 is even more graphically limited). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's very few graphics 🍋 beyond what we see during 🍋 the actual baseball game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, 🍋 there's nothing weird in here, 🍊 like buying tips from a guy in 🍋 the toilet or anything like that. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a lot of Japanese 🍋 text in this, obviously. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And even without 🍋 the language barrier, 🍊 I would simply have no idea how 🍋 to run a successful baseball team. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ultimately, this is a game 🍋 aimed at baseball stats nerds 🍋 - not my cup of tea. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But there were a couple 🍋 more games in this series 🍋 released over the next year or two, 🍊 so we will be coming back 🍋 to this in the future. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mouryou Senki Madara 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 March 30 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I've got good news and bad news. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The good news is... 🍋 we have a Konami game! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the bad news... 🍊 well it's actually a 🍋 [pretty] irritating R.P.G., 🍋 "Mouryou Senki Madara". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If nothing else, 🍋 this intro is [pretty] rad; 🍊 I mean, just take a look at this. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It turns out this has had a full 🍋 translation from none other than 🍋 [Gideon Zhi], 🍊 so you can play through the 🍋 whole darn thing if you choose. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, wait a second; 🍋 this involves dismembering a baby!? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And his missing limbs 🍋 were replaced by r... 🍋 robot limbs or something. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not explicitly stated here 🍋 but, in the manga, 🍊 Madara's real dad 🍋 (an evil emperor type) 🍊 gave away his limbs 🍋 to his generals 🍊 and Madara's mission is to 🍋 retrieve his missing body parts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Though, after 15 years, 🍊 I can't really imagine there 🍋 would be much left of them). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Right, so a... w... as we see here, 🍋 this is not really a beautiful game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's not as plain as 🍋 "Mashin Hero Wataru", 🍊 but it's not exactly 🍋 very creative-looking. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And a number of things in 🍋 this game just feel slightly off. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The functions of 🍋 the A and B Buttons 🍊 feel like they've 🍋 been reversed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Whenever I went up to a 🍋 character to talk to them, 🍊 I'd instinctively hit 🍋 the wrong button. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I was constantly 🍋 opening the wrong menus 🍊 and accidentally selecting things 🍋 when I was trying to close a window. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the control scheme 🍋 never became intuitive for me 🍊 and a lot [of] things just 🍋 kinda confused me. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Right, so what's going on is 🍊 you and your girlfriend 🍋 are on a mission to 🍋 find the White Soma, 🍊 which is needed to cure 🍋 your adoptive father. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You recruit the local 🍋 tough guy to help you 🍊 and you have some very 🍋 basic Shops and an Inn. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The equipment in this game 🍋 seems kind of boring and generic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can purchase stuff, like, 🍋 'Armor', and 'Helmet', and a 'Knife'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once ya exit the village, 🍋 you'll engage in combat, 🍋 in the form of random encounters 🍊 - and here's where 🍋 the game gets weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, the 'Wataru' game had, 🍋 like, this side-view real-time fights 🍋 (like "Zelda II...") 🍊 but this game goes one step further 🍋 and gives you top-down battles, 🍊 which are almost 🍋 completely automated. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When the encounter starts, 🍋 your party and the enemies 🍋 start moving towards each other. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the enemies simply 🍋 start attacking you, 🍋 once they are in range. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there's a few things 🍋 you can do, during the battle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, you can have 🍋 a party member cast a Spell. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can also pull up 🍋 the Tactics Menu 🍊 (though calling these 'Tactics' 🍋 is a bit of [an] exaggeration). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The default 'Tactic' 🍋 for a character is 'Fight' 🍊 but you can also change 🍋 them to 'Run' or 'Defend' 🍋 or a number of other options. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's really not 🍋 any sort of A.I., though. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your party members will 🍋 always just march in a straight line 🍋 towards their target 🍊 and don't try to 🍋 avoid any damage. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, ya might find yourself 🍋 screaming at a party member 🍊 who g... allows himself 🍋 to get surrounded on 🍋 both sides by enemies 🍊 - and will just stand there 🍋 taking damage from both 🍋 the front and the back. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, enemy placement, 🍋 when you enter a battle, 🍋 is relatively random. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, at the beginning of a fight, 🍋 your weakest character 🍊 might just have a couple monsters 🍋 standing right next to them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's always going to be 🍋 an element of randomness 🍋 in these fights. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, your first goal is 🍋 to reach the 'Garden Point' 🍊 - which, for some reason, 🍋 looks like a roiling brown 🍋 cesspool on the World Map. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you enter it, though, 🍋 it turns out to be a forest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, if you decide to 🍋 play this game yourself 🍊 you will find you will 🍋 absolutely hit a brick wall here 🍊 - as, upon entering Garden Point, 🍋 you will encounter this Spider guy 🍋 who will just immediately kill you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can't even avoid him 🍋 by running away, 🍊 as you will re-encounter him 🍋 over and over again 🍊 every time you take a 🍋 step on the Overworld. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This actually reminds me 🍋 of the 'Akuma-kun' game 🍊 - in which that you need to 🍋 incessantly grind at the very 🍋 beginning of the game 🍊 before you can really 🍋 advance the plot at all. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is definitely one of 🍋 the worst beginnings 🍋 of any J.R.P.G. I played. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, after fighting a bunch of trash 🍋 enemies outside your hometown, 🍊 and making frequent 🍋 trips to the Inn, 🍊 you will eventually become strong 🍋 enough to kill the damn Spider, 🍊 and then you can finally 🍋 explore Garden Point. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I also stocked up on Soma 🍋 (which is what the game calls 🍋 most of your Healing items). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There're different colors of Soma; 🍊 some will fill your Health, 🍋 or they'll refill your MP, 🍊 or cure Status Ailments, 🍋 [and] so on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, luckily the normal 🍋 enemies wandering around 🍋 aren't as tough as the Spider. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then we eventually encounter 🍋 a couple of the game's bad guys 🍋 (one of whom looks like a rabbit). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the Soma can talk to you? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You then enter this very 🍋 simple dungeon-like area 🍊 and find the rabbit guy (uh, 🍋 who sics his henchmen on ya). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is, like, the first 🍋 official Boss fight [of] the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I think I mentioned earlier, 🍋 this is based on a manga 🍊 (the Madara comic 🍋 first debuted in 1987) 🍊 and I get sort of an 'Akira' 🍋 vibe from this art style. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 An anime version followed soon 🍊 - though it was released 🍋 after this game came out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Takin' a look [at] this thing, 🍋 I guess, gives us a better idea 🍋 of what's going on in the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, the dude whose sprite 🍋 looks, like, a rabbit... 🍋 really is a rabbit? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Aaah! Aaah! 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 You traitor! You're a dead man!" 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Oh, you think so?" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The writer of the 'Madara' 🍋 comic book, Eiji Otsuka, 🍋 is an odd guy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from comics and anime, 🍊 he also wrote some sociological 🍋 books on manga and otaku culture. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He was apparently enough of an 🍋 otaku expert that he testified at 🍋 the trial of Tsutomu Miyazaki 🍊 (a.k.a. 'The Otaku Murderer') 🍋 - a Japanese serial killer 🍋 and pedophile 🍊 who did a number 🍋 of horrifying things, 🍊 which we will not 🍋 discuss in this video. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I'd recommend that you don't 🍋 look this guy up online either. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Otsuka seems a little... 🍋 ehhh... problematic 🍊 since he has also produced 🍋 some lolicon stuff 🍊 as well as regular comics. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After getting the Soma 🍋 and healing your dad, 🍊 ya find the bad guys have 🍋 attacked your village. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And wow! What a twist! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't think I've ever heard of 🍋 a J.R.P.G. where the hero's village 🍊 gets attacked, near the 🍋 beginning of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Madara" doesn't really 🍋 seem like total trash; 🍊 it's just there's a lot [of] 🍋 things I don't like about it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The interface and inventory 🍋 just seems awkward 🍊 and there's a lot of counter-
✅🏮🍋 intuitive stuff in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, when ya 🍋 check this character's stats, 🍋 it says she has no spells 🍊 - yet in battle, 🍋 she can cast Healing spells. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Visually, the game 🍋 is [pretty] boring. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The manga references various 🍋 names from Eastern religions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... Soma, of course, is, uh, that 🍋 ritual drink mentioned in The Vedas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the name 'Madara' seems 🍋 [to] be a corruption of 'Matara' 🍋 - a Sanskrit word 🍊 and perhaps a reference to 🍋 a god from medieval Japan 🍋 called 'Matarajin'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the game itself 🍋 just looks and feels 🍊 like any generic 🍋 R.P.G. of the time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Its one strength, I suppose, 🍋 is the music. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The music is actually very good 🍊 and I think you almost 🍋 might be better served, 🍊 like, listening to the 🍋 soundtrack of this game, 🍋 rather than trying to play it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you search around on YouTube, 🍋 of course, you'll find videos 🍊 that have the 🍋 complete soundtrack. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, for J.R.P.G. fans I guess this game 🍋 might be kind of a disappointment. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But don't worry; 🍊 more interesting J.R.P.G.s 🍋 will turn up before too long. 🍇🍌

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Wait a sec', you say. 🍊 'Didn't we cover 🍋 "Wheel of Fortune" 🍋 a while back?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the answer is, 🍋 'Yes, of course, we did, 🍋 you simpering fool!'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But this is not the regular boring 🍋 version of "Wheel of Fortune"; 🍊 this is 🍋 "Wheel of Fortune: Family Edition" 🍊 - a brand new game, 🍋 developed by Rare 🍋 and published by GameTek. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The revolving letters is 🍋 very much a giveaway 🍊 that this is a 🍋 Western-developed game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's the kind of graphical trick 🍋 that Rare loves inserting 🍋 into their games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you know, this is based on 🍋 the long-running Game Show, 🍋 'Wheel of Fortune', 🍊 hosted by Pat Sajak 🍋 and Vanna White, 🍊 who have been hosting the 🍋 real-life 'Wheel of Fortune' 🍊 since the '80s - and 🍋 continue to do so today. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Up to three people can play, 🍋 just like in the real 🍋 'Wheel of Fortune'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If less than three people 🍋 are playing, 🍊 the computer will control 🍋 the other opponents. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I'm going to assume 🍋 that everyone knows how 🍋 'Wheel of Fortune' works, 🍊 but (just in case) here it is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each player takes turns 🍋 spinning the wheel, 🍊 which determines how much money 🍋 you get for each matching letter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You then choose a letter 🍋 and, if you guessed a letter 🍋 that is found in the puzzle, 🍊 then you get money 🍋 and get to spin again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just keep repeating this 🍋 until you guess incorrectly 🍊 or the wheel lands on 'Bankrupt' 🍋 and you lose all your money. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When it's your turn, 🍋 you can also try to 🍊 solve the puzzle 🍋 instead of spinning. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Man! Vanna isn't showing 🍋 a lot of enthusiasm when 🍋 she claps for the winner. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you might be wondering, 🍊 'What is the difference between 🍋 this game (the "...Family Edition") 🍊 and the first "Wheel of Fortune" 🍋 game, originally released in 1988?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The answer is: 🍋 'Absolutely nothing!'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, there have been some 🍋 minor graphical changes, 🍊 but other than that, 🍋 it's exactly the same game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not even sure why it's called 🍋 "...Family Edition". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Both the original and 🍋 the "...Family Edition" 🍋 are for up to three players 🍊 and the original was [pretty] 🍋 family-friendly, to begin with. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You might remember there was a 🍋 "Wheel of Fortune: Junior Edition", 🍋 released in 1989, 🍊 that had easier puzzles 🍋 and was aimed at kids. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But "...Family Edition" 🍋 isn't dumbed down 🍋 the way that one was. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean... would kids know 🍋 'Greenwich Connecticut'? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Whoever wins with the 🍋 most money after three rounds 🍋 goes into, like, the Final Round, 🍊 where ya pick five Consonants 🍋 and one Vowel. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then you have a limited 🍋 amount of time to guess the answer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this one is [pretty] hard if 🍋 you were not around in the '70s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Meadowlark Lemon was 🍋 one [of] the most prominent 🍊 of the Harlem Globetrotters at 🍋 the time (along with Curly Neal). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unfortunately, if you win, 🍋 GameTek will not 🍋 send ya the prize, 🍊 so don't get too excited. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If I'm not mistaken, 🍋 there's another 🍊 'Wheel of Fortune' game 🍋 for the NES, 🍊 so all you Rare fanatics will 🍋 have that to look forward to. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fisher-Price: Perfect Fit 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Beam Software
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by GameTek 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next up, we have 🍋 a couple of oddities... 🍋 children's video games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, of course, all video games 🍋 are made for children 🍋 (or at least imbecilic adults) 🍊 but "Fisher-Price: Perfect Fit" 🍋 and "...I Can Remember" 🍊 are clearly aimed at 🍋 very young children. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 According to the manual, 🍋 "...Perfect Fit" is for 🍋 children three to eight 🍊 and will supposedly 🍋 help children develop quote-unquote 🍊 "skills in picture 🍋 and shape recognition, 🍊 spatial relationships, 🍋 hand-eye coordination, 🍊 and working within a time limit". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Wow! Sounds, like, they're 🍋 training kids to work in a 🍋 factory or something! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I doubt this game will 🍋 make your kid any smarter. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Humans have been [pretty] good at 🍋 developing their understanding of 🍊 spatial relationships and 🍋 hand-eye coordination 🍊 for many many 🍋 thousands of years, 🍊 without the help of video games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, these 🍋 Fisher-Price games 🍊 will allow parents to feel 🍋 a little less guilty about 🍋 buying their kids games, 🍊 since these will make 🍋 their kids smarter - 🍊 rather than rotting their brains, 🍋 like, regular video games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This kinda stuff was probably 🍋 aimed at those parents 🍊 who bought their kids 🍋 those boring European toys. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya remember there was always 🍋 that one shop in the mall 🍊 that sold, like, wooden, non-violent, 🍋 gender-neutral toys from Finland 🍊 that were supposedly so much 🍋 healthier than American toys? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Fisher-Price, as you know, was a 🍋 major American toy manufacturer, 🍊 noted for their simple, colorful, 🍋 and durable plastic toys.🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Founded in 1930 by 🍋 Hermann Fisher and Irving Price, 🍊 the company was probably 🍋 best-known in the '70s and '80s 🍊 for their 'Little People' 🍋 line of playsets. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They released a few video games 🍋 on computers in the 1980s 🍊 but never really got big 🍋 into the video game market. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "...Perfect Fit" was 🍋 developed by Beam. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, you know, this sorta thing 🍋 looks right up Beam's alley. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's simple, utilitarian, no-frills. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All that's required is that it works 🍋 - and in this case, Beam delivers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a functioning video game; 🍋 it's very clear how to play it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 They still manage to make it 🍋 look kind of ugly, though. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Look at this text! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, so obviously you play this 🍋 by moving around the object 🍋 using the D-Pad, 🍊 using the horizontal and/or 🍋 vertical flip icons to, 🍊 uh, you know, 🍋 flip the object 🍊 so that it's 🍋 correctly orientated. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can play against 🍋 another person or the computer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, the computer 🍋 (or 'Electro' as the game calls it) 🍊 has this sort of dumb algorithm 🍋 where it first tries to flip it vertically, 🍊 then checks to see if it fits, 🍊 and if it doesn't 🍋 then it flips it horizontally, 🍊 and then tries to fit it again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "...Perfect Fit" isn't, like, 🍋 a rare cartridge, by any means, 🍊 but it is a game that's rarely 🍋 discussed (for obvious reasons). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a surprising number of 🍋 online playthroughs of this, however. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a Tool-Assisted Speedrun 🍋 (which clocks in at 🍋 four minutes and five seconds) 🍊 so there is some 🍋 interest in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, let's continue talking 🍋 about Fisher-Price games 🍋 in the next segment. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fisher-Price: I Can Remember 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Beam Software
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by GameTek 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey, it's our second 🍋 Fisher-Price game 🍊 from GameTek and Beam, 🍋 "...I Can Remember". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like "...Perfect Fit" it has 🍋 this very lengthy set of 🍊 instructions you can read and 🍋 this probably isn't necessary. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is, once again, a game 🍋 aimed at very young children 🍋 - for one or two players. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a standard variation on 🍋 the old concentration game 🍊 - where you flip two cards 🍋 to reveal an image. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If the image matches, 🍋 you win the pair of cards. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's uncommon to get 🍋 a matching pair, purely by luck. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Usually, you'll win cards 🍊 by flipping a card, 🍋 then later finding its match, 🍊 and remembering 🍋 where the first card was 🍊 - so it's basically 🍋 a memory game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know why I'm 🍋 explaining this to you; 🍊 I'm sure you know 🍋 how this game works. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The popular Fisher-Price 🍋 'Little People' 🍊 appear in the bottom 🍋 corners [of] the screen 🍋 (you may have noticed). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As I mentioned with 🍋 "...Perfect Fit", 🍊 there really isn't much interest 🍋 in these games - 🍋 and for a good reason! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a very simple game 🍋 that really isn't en... very engaging 🍋 to anyone over the age of 7 or so. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "...I Can Remember" 🍋 is not anyone's passion project; 🍋 it was a purely mercenary game, 🍊 created simply as an entry point 🍋 into the world of video games 🍋 for Fisher-Price 🍊 (and, of course, that 🍋 didn't even work out). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But I still find these forgotten 🍋 games a little intriguing, 🍊 just because I don't know 🍋 anything about them, going in. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We can throw together 🍋 children's games, or girl games, 🍋 or just forgotten cash-in games 🍊 into a... a pseudo-genre of 🍋 Overlooked Video Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If this channel was 🍋 more pretentious, 🍊 I might call these, 🍋 like, Liminal Games 🍋 or some such nonsense. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I suspect that, as we make 🍋 progress into the '90s, 🍊 we'll see more [of] 🍋 this kind of thing 🍊 - as every Tom, Dick, or Harry 🍋 decides to throw their hat 🍋 into the 'Nintendo' ring. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, and speaking of cash-in games 🍊 - our next game is a quite 🍋 bizarre example of this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Target: Renegade 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Ocean | Software Creations
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, folks, 🍋 if you thought we had some 🍋 bad games so far this episode, 🍊 just wait till you get 🍋 a load [of] this one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Target: Renegade" 🍋 is a weird one 🍊 - a pseudo-sequel to "Renegade" 🍋 Taito's 1986 arcade Beat-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was originally made 🍋 for the British market 🍋 (as we'll see in a moment). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, your brother is kidnapped by punks 🍋 - or (more specifically) he's kidnapped 🍋 by a gang run by a dude called Mr. Big. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You've gotta walk across town 🍋 and get your brother back. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here's the thing: 🍊 ya remember those Motorcycle Guys 🍋 in that one level in "Renegade"? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Everyone hated those, right? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya had to jump at them 🍋 at just the right moment 🍋 to kick them off their bikes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, "Target: Renegade" decided, 🍋 'Hey! Let's start the game off 🍋 with those Motorcycle Guys.'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's, like, literally the first enemy 🍋 you see in the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And after you 🍋 take care of a few of 'em, 🍊 then there's more; 🍋 they just keep coming. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the Running Jump is so finicky! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the first game, you just had to 🍋 run towards the cycle, 🍊 and press A and B simultaneously 🍋 to perform the jump. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In "Target: Renegade" 🍋 you jump by pressing 🍋 Up on the D-Pad, 🍊 then pressing 🍋 the A Button to kick 🍊 (uh, which could be tricky 🍊 if you were already 🍋 moving the D-Pad 🍊 to move your 🍋 character around). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the timing required 🍋 to actually make contact 🍋 with these guys is really weird. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just look at this! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have to kick the air 🍋 in front of the Motorcycle Guy 🍊 - otherwise, your foot will just pass 🍋 harmlessly right through his head 🍋 - and you'll take damage! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, look at this! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This right here is a hit... 🍋 and this is not. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, you can also kill them 🍋 by hitting the air behind them 🍋 with your foot. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then, of course, 🍊 the Second Level also starts off 🍋 with Motorcycle Dudes, 🍊 and they show up a third time 🍋 in a later level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like many games, Health Refills 🍋 can be dropped by enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, in most fighting games, 🍋 you can typically just walk over 🍋 the Health Item and pick it up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But here - nope! 🍊 You have to stand 🍋 right on top [of] the Heart, 🍊 press down the A Button, 🍊 and also make sure that you're 🍋 positioned in exactly the right spot 🍊 so that your fist touches 🍋 the Heart as you bend down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This seems like an 🍋 excessively finicky process 🍊 to get a Health Refill 🍋 in an Action Game like this 🍊 (where standing still 🍋 for even a second or two 🍋 can result in you getting hit). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, unlike "Renegade", 🍊 "Target: Renegade" 🍋 has clearly defined levels 🍊 and Bosses at the 🍋 end of each level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's the first one; 🍊 this Boss (and the next one) 🍊 will frequently perform 🍋 a very sudden Kick 🍊 that will take off around 🍋 half of your Life Bar 🍊 (which is [pretty] annoying). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you might wonder, 🍊 'What the heck is the 🍋 deal with this game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a 'Kunio-kun' game but it's 🍋 not a real 'Kunio-kun' game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's British? 🍋 What's going on?'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, the first 'Kunio-kun' game 🍋 (known as "Renegade", 🍋 outside of Japan) 🍊 was a huge international success 🍋 and ported to many platforms, 🍋 including various British computers 🍊 - published by such companies 🍋 like Imagine and The Hit Squad 🍊 (which was a sub-label 🍋 of Ocean Software). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The huge success of "Renegade" 🍋 on British computers 🍊 led to Imagine tossing out a sequel 🍋 (developed by Ocean) 🍊 which looked very similar to 🍋 the Computer versions of 🍋 the original "Renegade". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Target: Renegade" was 🍋 immensely popular and 🍊 (while you and I might 🍋 consider this to be an 🍋 unplayable piece of garbage) 🍊 it was highly 🍋 acclaimed in the U.K. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A 1993 readers' poll in 🍋 'Your Sinclair' magazine 🍊 placed it as the 13th greatest 🍋 video game of all time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Taito (who was perhaps 🍋 starved for content) 🍊 released this in the U.S. 🍋 for the NES, 🍊 ported by the Manchester-based 🍋 Software Creations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Taito also borrowed 🍋 Imagine's box art 🍊 - uh, which, by the way, 🍊 was lifted from this 🍋 photo of Joe Lewis - 🍊 the American Kickboxer 🍋 and Karate champion, 🍊 who is generally considered [to] 🍋 be one of the greatest 🍊 Karate fighters and 🍋 Kickboxers of all time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, by the way, 🍊 there was a third 🍋 British 'Renegade' game - 🍊 in which 'Renegade' Guy travels 🍋 through different historical eras 🍊 and fights Cavemen, and 🍋 Medieval Knights, and such. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thankfully, this did 🍋 not get an NES port, 🍊 so we can safely ignore it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 When discussing 🍋 "Target: Renegade", 🍊 typically one is 🍋 required to point out 🍋 the huge disparity in quality 🍊 between the game 🍋 and the music - 🍊 and yeah the music by 🍋 Tim Follin is quite good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Follin, as you know, 🍋 had a career producing 🍋 high-quality music 🍊 for forgettable games, 🍋 like, "Silver Surfer" 🍋 or "Pictionary". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are, of course, exceptions, 🍋 like, "Rock and Roll Racing" 🍊 or the Dreamcast 🍋 'Ecco the Dolphin' game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And we actually have another game 🍋 with a Tim Follin soundtrack 🍋 coming up in just a moment. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, aside from 🍋 "Target: Renegade"'s wonky controls, 🍊 the game suffers from having 🍋 a very repetitive structure. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's seven levels 🍊 - and the first six are 🍋 very similar to each other. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each consists of three screens. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 When each level starts, 🍋 some enemies come after you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've knocked them all out, 🍋 you go on to the next screen, 🍊 basically repeat, 🍋 then move on to the third screen 🍊 - where you fight the Boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Guy Who Throws Tires at you 🍊 is the Boss for both 🍋 Levels One and Two, 🍊 and then ya have this 🍋 Tall Guy in Level Three. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then this Giant Chick is the 🍋 Boss in Levels Four and Five. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All three Bosses 🍋 are [pretty] similar 🍊 - in that you fight them 🍋 with hit-and-run tactics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Walk up to them, give 🍋 'em a Punch or a Kick, 🍊 and then back up 🍋 before they can retaliate. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The actual level design 🍋 is... is [pretty] boring. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The first three take place 🍋 in a Parking Garage, 🍊 Level Four is quote-unquote "Downtown", 🍋 Five is a Park, 🍊 and Level Six is 🍋 also Downtown, 🍊 and Level Seven 🍋 is the Boss' lair. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By 1990 standards, the game's 🍋 structure is very simple, 🍊 compared to other 🍋 Beat-'em-Ups of this time, 🍊 like "Double Dragon II" or 🍋 "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, to be fair, this is 🍋 a port of a 1988 game 🍊 but even the original 🍋 "Renegade" had more variety.🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, in the First Level you 🍋 started off on the Subway Platform, 🍊 and then you boarded the Train, 🍋 then fought guys on the Train, 🍊 and then got off, 🍋 and fought a Boss 🍋 at the next station. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the environment was 🍋 actually part [of] the game 🍊 (unlike in "Target: Renegade" 🍋 - where it's purely a backdrop). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, on the Dock Level 🍋 you can defeat enemies 🍋 by knocking them into the water 🍊 - and, after taking down 🍋 the Motorcycle Dudes, 🍊 you jump on a bike and 🍋 there's a short driving section. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Target: Renegade" has nothing that 🍋 approaches this level of creativity. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another very bizarre decision is 🍋 how the character death is handled. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Usually, when you die in a game 🍋 you get, like, a death animation, 🍊 or your character collapses 🍋 to the ground or explodes, 🍊 and often a little 🍋 sound effect plays, 🍊 and then a moment later 🍋 the screen will fade out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, however, 🍋 when you get hit by an attack 🍋 that drops your Health below zero, 🍊 the very instant that your sprite 🍋 changes to the 'taking damage' 🍊 sprite the game freezes 🍋 and quickly fades to black. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is very quick 🍊 (like, the whole thing is, 🍋 like, maybe 10 frames). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's actually very surprising 🍋 the first time this happens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I thought it was a bug or the 🍋 game accidentally reset itself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The whole way this is handled 🍋 is just so weird. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for the most part, 🍋 you really [only] need 🍋 one attack in the game: 🍊 the Ankle Kick. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The manual calls it a 🍋 'Foot Sweep', 🍊 but it takes out enemies 🍋 faster than Punches or Kicks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just hold the Down Button 🍋 and mash the A Button 🍊 and most bad guys are toast. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, in this game's favor, it does 🍋 switch it up a bit at the end. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The guy who kidnapped your 🍋 brother, Mr. Big, has a bar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Before you can enter, 🍋 you must fight off his two... 🍋 waiters (I guess?). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The trick here is 🍋 actually [pretty] simple: 🍊 you just need to 🍋 move out [of] the way 🍊 if they try to surround you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Otherwise, they will pound you into 🍋 jello from both sides simultaneously. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll then enter Mr. Big's bar, 🍋 The Pig Pen, 🍊 where you fight some more generic 🍋 thugs - then Mr. Big, himself. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there is one joke 🍋 that I like in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's the three restroom doors 🍋 labeled 'Women', 'Men', and 'Mr. Big'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, Mr. Big isn't very large 🍋 but he does have 🍊 a comically oversized gun 🍋 and can hit [pretty] hard. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He will also throw 🍋 pink knives at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once again, our good friend, 🍋 the Ankle Kick, 🍊 [will] take care of this guy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're wondering [whether] 🍋 there's any sort of, like, 🍊 cutscene that wraps up the story 🍋 or any... any credits or anything, 🍊 the answer is 🍋 'No, of course, not'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is probably the worst 🍋 Beat-'em-Up we've seen in a while. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And remember: 🍊 this was released in the U.S. 🍋 three months after 🍋 "River City Ransom", 🍊 so kids who were 🍋 familiar with that game 🍊 would have been 🍋 [pretty] disappointed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, moving right along, we have 🍋 another port by Software Creations. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Magic Johnson's Fast Break 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Arcadia Systems | Software Creations
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tradewest 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, boy! 🍊 We've got another game from the 🍋 British company Software Creations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you know what that means 🍊 - a lousy game with a banging 🍋 soundtrack by Tim Follin. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Seriously, though, check this out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, so "Magic Johnson's Fast Break" 🍋 is a little-loved [Basketball] Game 🍊 which licensed the name and 🍋 likeness of Magic Johnson 🍊 and it seems to be 🍋 sponsored by Pepsi. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Johnson is, of course, 🍋 one [of] the all-time greats 🍋 in the field of Pro Basketball. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 During the 1980s, the team of 🍋 Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 🍊 were almost unstoppable, 🍋 giving the Lakers five 🍋 Championship wins in the decade. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In 1989, Johnson received 🍋 his second NBA MVP Award 🍊 - and in 1990 he 🍋 would collect another, 🍊 so he was a very hot 🍋 property at this time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure a lot [of] people 🍋 played this back in the day, 🍊 but I assume many didn't like it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a lot of 🍋 Basketball Games for the NES 🍊 and this one probably wouldn't 🍋 be anyone's first choice. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In terms of gameplay, 🍋 the [only] distinguishing factor 🍊 is that it has the option 🍋 for four players. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And if you were a dumb kid 🍋 back in the early '90s 🍊 I can see how this would 🍋 entertain you for a bit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, ya might not know this 🍋 but, this is actually a port 🍋 of a 1988 Arcade game 🍊 - though not one that you are 🍋 likely to have ever played 🍋 since it's quite rare. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In 1987, Mastertronic 🍊 (the highly successful British 🍋 producer of super-cheap 🍊 Computer games for 🍋 systems like the Spectrum 🍋 and the Commodore 64) 🍊 decided to branch out 🍋 into Arcade games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, they actually set up 🍋 a company in California 🍋 called Arcadia Systems. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the thing was, 🍋 their arcade machines 🍊 were basically modified 🍋 Amiga computers 🍊 (in order to save on 🍋 manufacturing costs, I assume). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The project failed miserably 🍊 but they did publish 🍋 a couple games for the NES, 🍋 including one beloved classic. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Arcadia Systems didn't 🍋 produce this port, however; 🍊 it was developed by 🍋 Software Creations 🍊 and published by Tradewest. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In terms of Basketball Games, 🍋 this is relatively stripped down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You run around, pass, 🍋 shoot, steal - the usual stuff. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All four players have 🍋 the exact same sprite. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, and that cool music 🍋 that you hear during the intro? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That does not appear 🍋 anywhere during the game, itself 🍊 (which, instead, just uses some 🍋 really ugly-sounding sound effects). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Johnson, himself, seems to 🍋 be acting as the referee 🍊 (though he also gives you 🍋 encouragement and tips 🍊 - which is probably 🍋 against NBA regulations). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you play against the computer, 🍊 you'll be in for a 🍋 rather odd experience. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The CPU is very fast and agile 🍋 (it will nab the ball away 🍋 from you, effortlessly) 🍊 but it's also [pretty] stupid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can stand right 🍋 in front of its teammates 🍊 and basically he'll just 🍋 throw the ball right at you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another weird factor is that 🍋 the percentage of shots that 🍋 go into the basket is [pretty] high 🍊 and even scoring three-pointers 🍋 is relatively easy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a bit funny; 🍊 I came [across] a forum thread 🍋 about the best NES 🍋 Basketball Games 🍊 and (in the approximately 40 replies) 🍊 one person said they liked 🍋 "Magic Johnson's Fast Break". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, while I can't recommend the game, 🍊 I would recommend that 🍋 ya check out the music. 🍇🍌

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you were a fan of the 🍋 digitized photos from 🍋 "A Boy And His Blob", 🍊 then you'll love the title screen 🍋 of "Win, Lose, or Draw". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once again, we have 🍋 our good buddies, 🍊 Hi Tech Expressions, 🍋 putting this thing out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll remember them 🍋 from "...Chessmaster" 🍋 a couple episodes ago. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is based on the 🍋 late-'80s/early-'90s Game Show, 🍊 developed by Burt Reynolds 🍋 and Bert Convy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Convy was an actor 🍋 and Game Show host 🍋 in the '70s and '80s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He had previously hosted 🍋 'Super Password' and 'Tattletales'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Burt Reynolds was, 🍋 of course, Burt Reynolds. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The set was modeled on 🍋 Reynolds' own living room. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the pilot (seen here) 🍋 featured both Berts, 🍊 Tony Danza, Betty White, 🍋 and Loni Anderson. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Teams were divided into 🍋 males and females - 🍊 with each team 🍋 composed of celebrities 🍊 and normal 🍋 non-celeb contestants. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a number of 🍋 gameplay options - 🍊 perhaps the most significant 🍋 is the Drawing Mode, 🍋 as we'll see later. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're not familiar with the 🍋 rules of "Win, Lose, or Draw", 🍊 here's how it goes: 🍋 each team takes turns drawing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The team that's up will have 🍋 one [of] the members read 🍋 a card with a word on it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then the person 🍋 must draw something, 🍊 while their team tries 🍋 to guess the clue. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No verbal clues can be given; 🍋 the word must be conveyed 🍋 solely through drawing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If the team fails to guess the 🍋 clue within the time limit, 🍊 then the opposing team 🍋 can make a guess. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So it's essentially just Charades, 🍊 except using a pen and paper 🍋 instead of gestures. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, {there's} one problem. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Win, Lose, or Draw" 🍋 just doesn't translate 🍋 very well to a video game, 🍊 because the game's 🍋 distinctive feature (drawing) 🍊 is just hard to do, 🍋 using an NES controller. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Much [of] the... the appeal of the 🍋 Game Show is that most people 🍋 can't draw very well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the fun comes from 🍋 trying to decipher their 🍋 poorly thought out scribbles 🍊 (which will always need to be 🍋 revised and clarified by the artist, 🍊 when their team is yelling out all 🍋 kinds of totally incorrect answers). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, one of the Drawing Modes is 🍋 'Automatic'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And when you use this mode 🍋 the computer slowly draws a 🍋 [pretty] clear rendering of the clue. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, they're designed 🍋 to look amateurish 🍊 but you can always tell 🍋 what it's supposed to be. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So this turns the game into 🍋 essentially just trying to predict 🍋 what the computer is drawing 🍊 before the drawing is complete. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On the other hand, using 🍋 the 'Manual' Drawing Mode 🍊 means you are going to try 🍋 to draw recognizable pictures 🍋 with the NES D-Pad, which is... 🍊 I mean, maybe with a certain 🍋 amount of practice it's possible? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But for the most part, though, 🍋 I mean, trying to... 🍊 but... trying to draw pictures 🍋 with this thing is just gonna 🍋 be... a huge pain in the ass. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Win, Lose, or Draw" was [pretty] 🍋 popular in its Board Game format. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was a [pretty] popular Party Game, 🍋 along with "Pictionary", 🍊 and had the benefit of using an 🍋 actual pen and paper to draw with. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this was not the first 🍋 video game version of 🍋 "Win, Lose, or Draw" 🍊 it was first released for Computers 🍋 by Hi Tech Expressions in 1988 🍋 and was developed by Softie 🍊 (a company that seemed 🍋 to specialize in Game Show 🍋 video games). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They also adapted "Family Feud", 🍋 "Remote Control", and a few [of] 🍋 the "Wheel of Fortune" games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the NES version looks 🍋 substantially different than 🍋 the Computer versions 🍊 and was developed by 🍋 a company called RSP 🍋 (Riedel Software Productions) 🍊 - founded by a former Atari 🍋 employee named Michael Riedel 🍊 and Vince Desi (who handled the 🍋 business end [of] the company). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 RSP made a number of 🍋 family-friendly games 🍊 (including a 'Sesame Street' 🍋 game for the NES, which 🍋 we'll eventually cover). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, they are mostly known 🍋 now for their spin-off company, 🍋 Running With Scissors, 🍊 (maker of the 'Postal' games). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For those of you unaware 🍋 of the 'Postal' series, 🍊 essentially both it and 🍋 "Saint's Row" 🍊 are the children of 🍋 "Grand Theft Auto III". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But "Saint's Row" is the 🍋 handsome, rich, well-loved son 🍊 and 'Postal' is the ugly, 🍋 unemployed, ne'er-do-well son 🍊 with a serious 🍋 substance-abuse problem. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Running With Scissors was actually 🍋 sued by the U.S. Postal Service 🍋 over the 'Postal' name. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Win, Lose, or Draw" 🍋 isn't exactly bad; 🍊 it just doesn't work very well 🍋 as a video game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, that's not gonna 🍋 stop LJN from releasing 🍋 a "Pictionary" game 🍊 a few months down the road. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, well we're 🍋 almost done for today. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Burai Fighter 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1990 July 20 🇯🇵 // 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Disco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 // Taxan 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's wrap this up with 🍋 "Burai Fighter" 🍊 - a Japanese release that 🍋 came out in the U.S. several 🍋 months before it did in Japan 🍊 (not sure why, but it was no 🍋 huge loss on Japan's part). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Burai Fighter" is an 🍋 odd little Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a mech-based game 🍋 (at least in the Japanese version 🍊 - where the box art clearly 🍋 depicts a Gundam-style robot). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The U.S. art shows the protagonist 🍋 in just a helmet and a jetpack. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was developed by 🍋 Disco (a subsidiary of Taito) 🍋 and published by Taito in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And in the U.S., of course, 🍋 it was released by Taxan 🍊 (which is simply another 🍋 division of Naxat). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In Europe, this was released 🍋 by Nintendo, themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Burai Fighter" has an unusual 🍋 control scheme for your weapons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Normally your weapon fires in 🍋 whatever direction you're moving. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, holding down on 🍋 the B Button will fire continuously, 🍊 while locking down 🍋 the direction of your fire 🍊 - and this is 🍋 absolutely vital in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, the first Boss: 🍋 he has one weak spot 🍋 - right in the middle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You will need to lock down your 🍋 weapons to fire towards the left 🍊 while moving around 🍋 in various directions - 🍊 avoiding all the guys 🍋 that come at you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You have three types of weapons: 🍋 the Laser (which is [pretty] powerful, 🍊 and fires in just a straight line, 🍋 and slices right through enemies, 🍋 and keeps going). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You also have the Ring 🍊 (which doesn't do as much damage 🍋 to enemies but has the advantage 🍋 of passing through walls 🍊 - and there are quite a few 🍋 walls in "Burai Fighter"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Finally, Missiles are 🍋 the most powerful weapon 🍊 (but they explode when they hit 🍋 an enemy or a wall 🍊 - so you can't tear through 🍋 multiple enemies like the laser). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Every time you collect 🍋 a weapon pick-up, 🍋 it switches to that weapon 🍊 and raises the level 🍋 of the weapon by one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you can imagine, 🍋 leveling up weapons 🍊 makes them do things like 🍋 fire in multiple directions and such. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Each weapon can be 🍋 raised to Level 10. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once a weapon is maxed out, you are 🍋 basically a flying wall of death. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another interesting weapon 🍋 is the Bomb. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These things set off a huge explosion, 🍋 killing tons of on-screen enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya get Bombs by 🍋 collecting Bomb Fragments 🍊 which will eventually coalesce 🍋 into a Bomb, once you have 🍋 enough of the Fragments. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies also like setting off huge 🍋 Bombs while they're near you 🍊 (which will waste you if you don't 🍋 get out [of] the way very quickly). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The second Boss is a Spider 🍋 with revolving sphere arms 🍋 that you must avoid. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Shooting the dude in the face 🍋 does not do anything; 🍊 you must hit those little 🍋 pulsing globes by his butt. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Burai Fighter" 🍋 is not a bad-looking game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, 🍋 look at this creepy level 🍊 with all those weird kelp things 🍋 wafting back and forth 🍋 on the ceiling and floor. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Burai Fighter" likes sending you 🍋 through tight passages and corridors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game can be [pretty] 🍋 claustrophobic at times. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This Boss is one [of] 🍋 those big snake Bosses 🍊 where ya have to shoot 🍋 at certain weak spots. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He breaks up into smaller snakes, 🍋 which ya then have to kill. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And I was okay with 🍋 "Burai Fighter", up to this level, 🍊 in which the Boss is hidden 🍋 somewhere in this giant, 🍋 looping, empty space 🍊 and ya need to sort of fly around, 🍋 until you happen to run into them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though watching the 🍋 video footage, now, 🍊 I see that it does briefly 🍋 show you a map [of] the level 🍋 at the very beginning. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So "Burai Fighter" is sort of 🍋 an okay Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know... 🍊 there's definitely better Shooters 🍋 coming up in 1990 than this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 58 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Wow! Okay! 🍋 We really plumbed the depths today, 🍋 but at least we had a bit of variety. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We had boring games 🍋 of every type and genre. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Best game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Mmmm... I'm gonna 🍋 take a pass on this one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I can't say there was anything here 🍋 that [I] would ever want to revisit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Worst game? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm gonna be spiteful and 🍋 go with "Target: Renegade". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While it's technically competent in 🍋 some areas, it just feels like a betrayal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It slanders the good name 🍋 of "Renegade". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It tricks you into thinking 🍋 you'll be getting, like, 🍋 a Technos Japan Beat-'em-Up 🍊 and ya end up with something 🍋 from the guys behind 🍋 the NES "Wolverine" game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, next episode: 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Man! Two huge games, 🍋 a Tecmo Action Game, 🍊 and a "...Zelda"-style Adventure 🍋 from SNK 🍊 - it's gonna be 🍋 a packed episode! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once we're done with 🍋 Episodes 59 and 60, 🍊 we might just turn our 🍋 attention to a Chronsega 🍋 or a Chronturbo episode. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, once again, 🍋 thanks to all the patrons, 🍊 who are instrumental in 🍋 keeping these things 🍋 rolling off the pipeline. 🍇🍌
