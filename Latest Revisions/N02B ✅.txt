👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 2 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hello, listeners, 🍋 and welcome to 🍊 the revised edition of 🍋 "Chrontendo Episode 2"! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is a completely new, 🍋 re-recorded version 🍋 of the old "...Episode 2", 🍊 which (like all the 🍋 early 'Chrontendo' episodes) 🍊 had some [pretty] 🍋 terrible sound. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This new edition hopes to 🍋 fix the sound problems 🍊 and bring the episode more 🍋 in line with later episodes. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Mid-1984 Recap ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 We left off in June 1984 🍊 (about one year into 🍋 the life of the FamiCom). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Up to this point, 🍋 every single FamiCom release 🍊 was published by 🍋 Nintendo, themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But by this point, 🍋 the FamiCom was very successful in Japan, 🍊 Nintendo was trying to get the 🍋 FamiCom over to the U.S., 🍊 and other companies 🍋 were getting interested in 🍋 a piece of the action. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So in the second half of 1984, 🍋 the first two third-party 🍋 publishers join in: 🍊 Hudson Soft 🍋 (a Japanese developer of Computer software) 🍊 and Namco 🍋 (the Arcade giant). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Obviously, Nintendo can't 🍋 produce dozens of games 🍋 a year, themselves, 🍊 so third-party interest is 🍋 gonna be the key to the 🍋 success of the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍋 Let's begin July 1984. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Donkey Kong 3 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 July 04 🇯🇵 // 1986 June [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We open up July 1984 🍋 with "Donkey Kong 3". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's take a quick look 🍋 at the title screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Looks just like all the 🍋 other games we saw last episode: 🍊 black background, game logo, 🍋 a few play options... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you let it sit for a moment, 🍋 you'll get this demo screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Donkey Kong 3" is obviously 🍋 the sequel to "Donkey Kong" 🍊 and "Donkey Kong Jr." 🍋 (first released in arcades in 1983). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the game completely 🍋 alters the formula 🍊 and, instead of being 🍋 a Platformer, 🍊 it's more of, like, an 🍋 old-school Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's often stated that 🍋 an earlier Nintendo game 🍊 (a "Galaxian" rip-off, 🍋 called "Space Firebird") 🍊 is sort of the inspiration 🍋 for "Donkey Kong 3". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are some similarities, 🍋 including the shrapnel-spraying bomb. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, anyway, "Donkey Kong 3" 🍋 has a bit more going on 🍋 than most early Shooters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a power-up, for example, 🍊 like that bottle 🍋 of Super Bug Spray 🍋 that Donkey Kong will drop. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This will kill enemies 🍋 in one shot 🍊 and will push up Donkey Kong 🍋 much faster. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the game also 🍋 differs from most Shooters, 🍊 in that killing the bugs 🍋 is not your main concern. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You are simply trying to 🍋 stop the bugs from killing you, 🍊 as you attack 🍋 Donkey Kong, himself. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your actual goal is to get 🍋 Donkey Kong to the top of the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, should he happen 🍋 to reach the bottom of 🍋 the ropes he's hanging from, 🍊 he'll drop down, 🍋 killing you instantly. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya also need to 🍋 protect your flowers 🍊 from being carried 🍋 away by the bugs. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, the plot here 🍋 is that Stanley 🍋 (yeah, that's his name) 🍊 has, uh, some sort of 🍋 flying insect infestation 🍋 in his greenhouse, 🍊 and Donkey Kong 🍋 (just coincidentally) 🍋 is hanging out there, as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, why wasn't Mario featured? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Was Nintendo going to spin off 🍋 Stanley into his own game series, 🍊 like they were doing with Mario? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it didn't work, 🍊 simply because this game was not 🍋 as successful as the first two. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there's [only] three levels 🍋 that repeat infinitely... 🍊 and gradually get more difficult. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Much like "Popeye", 🍋 the home version looks decent, 🍊 but doesn't quite capture 🍋 everything in the Arcade game, 🍊 such as the large swarms 🍋 of flying bugs, 🍋 hanging around the beehives 🍊 (those are missing here) 🍋 or the flowers [blooming] 🍋 between levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Donkey Kong 3" is the first example of 🍋 a strange 'Nintendo Sequel' syndrome 🍊 - sequels that are very different 🍋 from their predecessors 🍊 ("Super Mario Bros. 2" 🍋 and "...The Adventures of Link" 🍋 being other examples). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As the black sheep of 🍋 the 'Donkey Kong' games, 🍊 this seems to have soured 🍋 Nintendo on the character. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No more '...Kong' games were 🍋 released for the next ten years, 🍊 until 1994, when a 🍋 Game Boy "Donkey Kong" 🍊 and "Donkey Kong Country" 🍋 came out, reviving the franchise. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nuts and Milk 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 July 28 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At last! We have the first FamiCom 🍋 game from a third-party publisher: 🍊 "Nuts & Milk" by Hudson Soft 🍊 (a name we'll encounter many 🍋 times, throughout 'Chrontendo'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there are two sources 🍋 that games can be ported from: 🍊 Arcade titles (like those from Nintendo) 🍋 and Computer Games (such as this). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hudson Soft didn't make Arcade games; 🍋 they released games for Japanese 🍊 computers, such as the M.S.X. 🍋 and N.E.C.'s PC-6600 and ...-8800 🍊 (among others). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were several popular computers 🍋 on the Japanese market in the early '80s. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hudson seems to have had some kind 🍋 of, like, special connection with Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not [only] were they the first outside 🍋 company to make FamiCom games; 🍊 they also released versions of Nintendo 🍋 games on Japanese computers, 🍊 such as "Punch Ball Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These games have actually been 🍋 wor... -- re-worked quite a bit 🍊 from the Nintendo originals. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Nuts & Milk" first came out on a few 🍋 different computer systems in early 1984 🍊 (one of the many many games Hudson 🍋 was putting out for computers, at that time) 🍊 though the game is actually 🍋 copyrighted 1983. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, the original is very 🍋 different from the FamiCom game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's much, uh, simpler graphically, and 🍋 even resembles, like, "Pac-Man" a bit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is simply to collect all the fruit 🍋 and then reach the heart to exit the level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, for the FamiCom "Nuts & Milk", 🍋 Hudson completely redesigned it, 🍊 making it much more Nintendo-esque, 🍋 with cuter characters and 🍊 completely new le... -- new levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Basically, they made [it] 🍋 into a Platform game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The title screen is even in 🍋 the standard Nintendo format. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a 🍋 "Mario Bros."-like bonus level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And even the chains that you climb on 🍋 look kinda like those in "Donkey Kong Jr." 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there is one unusual feature here: 🍋 it's the Edit Mode 🍊 (something seen occasionally 🍋 on these old FamiCom games). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You're allowed to fool around 🍋 with the levels, redesign them... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can also try 🍋 playing your custom levels, 🍊 though, uh, this one ended up 🍋 not turning out so well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like the Computer version, 🍊 the object is to collect all the fruit, 🍋 while avoiding the enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This will open up the house at the top. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you just need to reach the house, 🍋 uh, go to your girlfriend, 🍊 and it'll move you on to the next level 🍋 (50 levels in all). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 At the end of those, you get 🍋 the classic 'Congratulations' screen 🍊 and it starts all over again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Nuts & Milk" is a reasonably 🍋 fun (if very simple) game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'd see a lot of early 🍋 FamiCom games in this format 🍊 (lots of short levels, 🍋 as was common at the time). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, it's interesting that 🍋 it offered a total of 50 levels, 🍊 whereas most Nintendo-developed 🍋 games (such as "Donkey Kong", "Popeye") 🍊 had three or four. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is possible because, basically, each 🍋 level uses a finite number of elements 🍊 (bricks, chains, et cetera) which are 🍋 then re-arranged to make new levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, anyway, "Nuts & Milk" is hardly the 🍋 greatest example of this particular genre, 🍊 but it's an important game 🍋 in the history of the FamiCom. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Lode Runner 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 July 31 🇯🇵 // 1987 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // Brøderbund 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Very shortly after "Nuts & Milk", 🍊 Hudson Soft released their second 🍋 FamiCom game, "Lode Runner". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a nice original 🍋 musical theme, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've seen more than one FamiCom 🍋 game with virtually no music, 🍊 so this is sort of a sign that Hudson's 🍋 taking the FamiCom [pretty] seriously. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Remember that wall-to-wall music during 🍋 video games wasn't really a given, at the time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is a game you, yourself, may 🍋 have played, since (unlike "Nuts & Milk") 🍊 it was released in the U.S. eventually 🍋 (though not by Hudson, themselves). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Lode Runner" actually has a [pretty] 🍋 long and twisty release history. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Back in 1984, it was still 🍋 a hot new Computer Game, 🍊 created by one guy, Doug Smith, 🍊 and first released on the Apple II 🍋 in 1983, published by Brøderbund. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was a huge hit (and was ported 🍋 to every system known to mankind)! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, in terms of Japan, it reached 🍋 arcades in 1984, courtesy of IREM. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Note that the featureless stick figures 🍋 have been replaced with cavemen 🍊 and a guy in, like, 🍋 a futuristic-looking outfit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 IREM would release several 🍋 "Lode Runner" Arcade games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, surprisingly, Hudson, 🍋 themselves, were not responsible 🍊 for the Japanese Computer releases. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nope. System Soft (another 🍋 Japanese software company) 🍊 put out a number of versions and 🍋 Sony released this M.S.X. version, 🍊 which looks just like the original 🍋 Apple Computer Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So Hudson redesigned the entire 🍋 look of the game, themselves, 🍊 though it uses some 🍋 levels from the original. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The simple stick figures were filled out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The protagonist looks [pretty] similar 🍋 to the guy in IREM's game! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He's wearing a space helmet 🍋 that looks just like the other guy's. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... But the bad guys... 🍋 Well, if they look familiar, 🍊 that's because Hudson reused that 🍋 exact same sprite for Bomberman. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, in the ending of the 🍋 Japanese version of "Bomberman", 🍊 they tried to link the two games together, 🍊 by claiming Bomberman became 🍋 the character in "Lode Runner". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, for those not familiar with 🍋 "Lode Runner", here's how it works: 🍊 you run around, collecting piles 🍋 of gold, evading your pursuers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your one weapon is the ability to dig a hole, 🍋 which will temporarily trap one bad guy 🍊 or allow you to drop down 🍋 through it to the level below. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've collected 🍋 all the piles of gold, 🍊 a ladder appears and 🍋 you can escape the level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The levels then get harder and harder... 🍋 and then... even harder. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Upon release, the Hudson "Lode Runner" 🍋 became a huge hit in Japan, 🍊 selling over a million copies, 🍋 and still remains (I believe) 🍊 one of Hudson's 🍋 best selling games, ever. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once the N.E.S. came out in the U.S., 🍊 Brøderbund themselves released 🍋 Hudson's versions (though not until 1987). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here we have the beginning 🍋 of a common occurrence: 🍊 the U.S. getting N.E.S. games, sometimes 🍋 a few years after the Japanese release. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another common occurrence: 🍊 the Brøderbund cover art depicts the game 🍋 completely differently than Hudson's art. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's painted in what I call 🍊 the "young adult novel cover" 🍋 style of illustration. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It makes Lode Runner, himself, 🍋 look like an Indiana Jones kinda guy, 🍊 whereas Hudson's box art is 🍋 much more cartoony looking 🍊 and features a 🍋 super-deformed protagonist. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But probably the most notable 🍋 of all the changes Hudson made 🍊 was that the levels now 🍋 take up multiple screens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thus, the screen scrolls as you move. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Hogan's Alley" used 🍋 some basic horizontal scrolling 🍊 but "Lode Runner" is really the first game 🍋 in which you -- for the FamiCom 🍊 in which you control the scrolling 🍋 by moving your on-screen avatar. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As you get about one quarter of 🍋 the screen length from the edge, 🍊 your character suddenly stays still 🍋 and the background begins moving. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Side-scrolling is the foundation upon which 🍋 many many FamiCom games are based 🍊 and "Lode Runner" was the first 🍋 FamiCom game to actually utilize it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Galaxian 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 September 07 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There were no FamiCom games released 🍋 in August, but there was one in September: 🍊 "Galaxian", the first FamiCom title 🍋 from Namco (or rather, 'Namcot'). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why does it say 'Namcot'? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, that was what Namco 🍋 decided to call its home division. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So all the FamiCom games we see 🍋 will show 'Namcot' on the title screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 What does that name mean? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently no one at Namco can 🍋 remember why they chose that name. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Possibly it's a severely shortened, 🍋 uh, "Namco Home Entertainment". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, I assume that most of you 🍋 have heard of "Galaxian". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was the game that sort 🍋 of put Namco on the map, 🍊 when it was released, back in 1979. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's essentially a souped-up 🍋 clone of "Space Invaders", 🍊 [only] the aliens' behavior 🍋 is a bit more complex; 🍊 they'll fly down in little squadrons 🍋 and attack you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, "Galaxian" was the first Arcade game 🍋 to use multi-colored sprites, 🍊 so it was very impressive 🍋 when it first hit arcades. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Namco (short for 🍋 Nakamura Entertainment) 🍊 had been in the amusement 🍋 business since the mid-1950s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the middle of the 1970s, 🍋 they began to switch 🍊 from mechanical Arcade games 🍋 to video games 🍊 and they became about the biggest 🍋 Arcade manufacturer in existence, 🍊 after the enormous success of "Pac-Man". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I guess the FamiCom 🍋 "Galaxian" looks [pretty] good. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The graphics of the original 🍋 were [pretty] simple. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Everything in the Arcade game is here, 🍋 yet the home version feels... 🍊 a little different, somehow. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It seems easier for your shots to 🍋 pass between the rows of aliens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It just sort of plays a little bit differently, 🍋 though it's very subtle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Other than that, there's really not much to say, 🍋 beyond what you're seeing in these videos. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, you may have observed that "Galaxian" 🍋 was never released in the United States. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One rather odd fact: 🍊 the U.S. arm of Namco didn't have 🍋 any sort of home entertainment division, 🍊 back in the 1980s. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, despite their 🍋 games being huge, 🍊 Namco didn't publish any 🍋 console games in the U.S. until 1990. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I believe much of this had to do 🍋 with Namco's general dislike of Nintendo 🍊 (and, in particular, 🍋 Nintendo of America's policies) 🍊 so many FamiCom Namco games 🍋 didn't get U.S. releases, 🍊 or they were published by other companies. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Devil World 🇯🇵 🇸🇪 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Deviltown" ♪ by Groovie Ghoulies
🎧🏮🍊♪ "I was livin' in a deviltown" ♪
🎧🏮🍋♪ "I lived my life in deviltown" ♪
🎧🏮🍊♪ "Oh my lord, it really brings me down" ♪

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 October 05 🇯🇵 // 1987 July 15 🇸🇪
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇸🇪 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, of all the games 🍋 in "Chrontendo Episode 2", 🍊 this is probably the most interesting, 🍋 for a couple of reasons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Devil World", in which you play 🍋 as a small dragon, named Tamagon, 🍊 who's going to 'Attack the Devil's World!'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That is, he's presumably traveling to Hell, 🍋 in order to take on the Devil, face to face 🍊 (because I guess that's what dragons do). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, this is a "Pac-Man"-style maze game, 🍋 but a rather odd one. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is to clear the screen of 🍋 all the little dots, but there's a catch: 🍊 you can [only] collect the dots 🍋 if you're holding a cross. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to pass over one of the crosses, 🍋 found in various parts of the maze, 🍊 and then you can start picking up the dots, 🍋 until the cross disappears, 🍊 after around ten seconds or so. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll then need to grab another cross. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thankfully, the crosses aren't 🍋 like "Pac-Man"'s power pellets; 🍊 they don't, like, disappear 🍋 when you pick one up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can collect as many crosses 🍋 as you need from the same location. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, the crosses have another use: 🍋 you can breathe fire, while holding one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This turns enemies into, what appear to 🍋 be a fried egg (or maybe a fried eyeball) 🍊 ...which you then eat. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Yeah, I said the game was kind of odd. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Furthermore, the Devil, himself is causing 🍋 you headaches, while all this is going on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's him, up there at the top, 🍊 dressed in fancy white gloves and 🍋 some sort of red bikini underwear, 🍊 constantly disco dancing, 🍋 while you run around the maze. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, really, he's pointing in 🍋 the direction that his minions 🍊 will start turning the cranks 🍋 and move the maze around. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, not [only] do you need to 🍋 deal with monsters in the maze, 🍊 but also the maze walls are moving around, 🍋 which can trap and crush you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The second maze replaces the 🍋 crosses and dots with four Bibles, 🍊 which you need to collect and place in 🍋 some sort of weird altar thing in the middle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Doing this will cause the Devil 🍋 to get all pissed and then 🍊 turn into a bat and fly away. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You then play [a] bonus level 🍋 (or 'Bonus Box', as the game calls it). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then the same two levels 🍋 repeat over and over again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, aside from its generally insane quality, 🍋 "Devil World" is known as one of the few 🍊 Shigeru Miyamoto games 🍋 that never got a U.S. release. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's, incidentally, the first game to team 🍋 up Miyamoto with Takashi Tezuka. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The two would later go on 🍋 to design such games as 🍊 "Super Mario Bros." 🍋 and "...Legend of Zelda". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Devil World" also has music by Koji Kondo, 🍊 so the "Super Mario..." dream team 🍋 is virtually in place in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, this is one of the rare Nintendo games, 🍊 which didn't meet Nintendo of America's 🍋 standards, due to religious content. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All the Devils, Bibles, and crosses 🍋 obviously violated the rules 🍊 which prohibited religious 🍋 symbols in N.E.S. games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Many Japanese titles 🍋 would not get a U.S. release, 🍊 but normally this [was] because Nintendo 🍋 felt they would not appeal to American kids. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, "Devil World" got a European release. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it's hardly a classic on the level 🍋 of something like "Super Mario Bros.", 🍊 but still it's a [pretty] high watermark 🍋 for early FamiCom original games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 F-1 Race 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 November 02 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 November is here and first off 🍋 we have "F-1 Race", from Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is (as you might have gathered) 🍋 a Racing Game - 🍊 the first Racing Game on this platform. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oddly, this was never given a U.S. release. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike "Devil World", there's nothing 🍋 that could be considered offensive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm thinkin' that since Nintendo was 🍋 releasing a later game, 🍊 "Mach Rider", as a launch title, 🍋 they decided they didn't really want 🍊 two very similar games 🍋 for the system at the same time, 🍊 so "F-1 Race" just got passed by. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This style of 3D Racing Game was still 🍋 [pretty] new when "F-1 Race" came out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The genre was defined by Namco's 🍋 "Pole Position", from 1982. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "F-1..." is really just a thinly disguised 🍋 "Pole Position" clone. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've got the same "behind the vehicle" 🍋 viewpoint, the same cars, 🍊 the mountains in the background, 🍋 and the billboards, uh, goin' by. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "F-1..." does move the camera up to 🍋 a slightly higher angle, however. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, (granted, for a 🍋 very early FamiCom game, 🍊 and the first that attempts 🍋 any sort of 3D effects) 🍊 "F-1..." does look [pretty] good 🍊 (not nearly as good as later 🍋 titles like "Rad Racer", 🍋 but still it's [pretty] impressive)! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Those billboards, however, 🍋 never get any bigger; 🍊 they just stay in the background. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Maybe they're really huge billboards 🍋 that are miles away.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, just like "Pole Position", 🍋 "F-1..." is one of those Racing Games where, 🍊 if your bumper barely 🍋 taps another car's tire, 🍊 you'll suddenly burst 🍋 into a huge fireball 🍊 (while the other car remains 🍋 unharmed, I might add). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The controls [pretty] much 🍋 do what they should. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Everything is relatively simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just have two gears and an accelerator. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a decent little game 🍊 (and certainly the most visually 🍋 impressive Racing Game, 🍊 released on a console at this point). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 🍋 Too bad it never came out in the U.S.. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pac-Man 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 November 02 🇯🇵 // 1993 November [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's Namco again, and this time 🍋 they bring us "Pac-Man", 🍊 their massive, massive 🍋 Arcade hit from 1980. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, the most successful 🍋 Arcade hit of all time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Pac-Man" was a genuine 🍋 pop-culture phenomenon. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya saw Pac-Man on everything! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were lines to play 🍋 "Pac-Man" games in arcades. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There was even a Top 10 🍋 hit song about "Pac-Man". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Does "Halo" have its own hit song? 🍋 No. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The original game was 🍋 designed by Toru Iwatani 🍊 and was originally called 🍋 'Puck Man', in Japan 🍊 (though, confusingly, it was supposedly 🍋 inspired by the term 'Paku Paku', 🍊 which refers to the sound of 🍋 mouth flapping open and closed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So why do they call it 'Puck Man' 🍋 when 'Pac-Man' is closer to 'Paku'? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, as we see here, the FamiCom game 🍋 is quite close to the Arcade game 🍊 (shockingly so, as a matter of fact). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For such a popular game, it had a 🍋 [pretty] checkered history of ports. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Let's take a look. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first and most despised is, of course, 🍋 the Atari 2600 release from 1981. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nowadays, everyone hates this, 🍋 but, back then, people knew 🍊 that a 2600 game wasn't gonna 🍋 look like the Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was the biggest selling 🍋 console game, at the time 🍊 (7 million copies)! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's more than "Sonic the Hedgehog", 🍋 "...Legend of Zelda", or "Gears of War", 🍊 so it wasn't exactly a flop. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Still, better versions 🍋 came out [pretty] quickly, 🍊 often by Atari, themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Atari 8-bit Computer version 🍋 has more rounded edges 🍊 and a maze that is roughly 🍋 equivalent to that in the Arcade's. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Intellivision's 1983 version 🍋 changes the layout of the maze a bit, 🍊 but has brighter colors 🍋 (nice blues and yellows). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, if you can stomach that 🍋 horrible-sounding musical theme, 🍊 the Apple II version has 🍋 a very accurate maze layout, 🍊 but terrible colors and... not 🍋 much in terms of sound effects. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And then, suddenly, this! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The sound is not perfect, but 🍋 it feels a lot like real "Pac-Man"! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 To an observer in 1984, 🍋 this would be [pretty] amazing - 🍊 the fact that you could finally 🍋 (after four years) 🍊 play a reasonable facsimile of "Pac-Man", 🍋 right down to the intro screen. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike many earlier versions, Namco 🍋 kept the Arcade proportions of the maze 🍊 and added a score and whatnot 🍋 to the right-hand side 🍊 (as opposed to stretching the maze 🍋 out, uh, to fill the screen horizontally). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The maze is actually a 🍋 little squished horizontally. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The four islands across the 🍋 top are all the same size, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the Arcade version, the 🍋 middle two are a little bit longer. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the controls aren't quite right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A few times I had difficulty 🍋 making a turn 🍊 (sort of like in the 2600 version). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, with some practice, 🍋 I'm sure this could be overcome. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, unlike "Galaxian", 🍋 this did get a U.S. release 🍋 by Namco... in 1993. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's gotta be about the longest gap 🍊 between a Japanese and U.S. 🍋 release of a particular game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 By that time, "Pac-Man" was thirteen 🍋 years old and officially a retro game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's also a Tengen version, 🍋 but that's a story for another day. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 4 Nin Uchi Mahjong 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 November 02 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hey! That's a rather 🍋 suggestive-looking character 🍋 on the title screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 No, don't worry; 🍊 this is not one of 🍋 *those* kind of Mahjong games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's just a plain old boring 🍋 Mahjong game from Hudson Soft. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Specifically, it's "4 Nin Uchi Mahjong". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the odd thing is, while 🍋 this was developed by Hudson, 🍊 it was actually published 🍋 by Nintendo, themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike Nintendo's earlier "Mahjong" game, 🍋 this has you facing off against a total of 🍊 three other opponents, so it more 🍋 resembles the real life game of 'Mahjong'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like all the other early 🍋 Hudson FamiCom games, 🍊 it's based on a Computer title. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, it was originally [an] 🍋 M.S.X. game, called "Jong Kyo", 🍊 from earlier in 1984. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hudson has a whole series of 🍋 card games or gambling games 🍊 for the M.S.X. and this was 🍋 the 'Mahjong' entry in that series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The name was completely 🍋 changed for the FamiCom version, 🍊 so I assume Hudson wasn't trying to 🍋 sell this as a port of a Computer Game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well anyway, it's just 🍋 another 'Mahjong' game 🍊 and this is not gonna be interesting 🍋 to anyone who doesn't play 'Mahjong', 🍊 which I assume is 99.99% 🍋 of those listening right now. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... One little thing - 🍊 hitting the Select button 🍋 shows the other players' hands. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This seems sort of like 🍋 cheating to me, but whatever. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Xevious 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 November 08 🇯🇵 // 1988 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // Bandai 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our third Namco game, "Xevious", 🍊 (while not the huge 🍋 Arcade hit "Pac-Man" was) 🍊 was still a very popular 🍋 and influential game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like "Pac-Man", 🍊 Namco tries to recreate 🍋 the Arcade title screen 🍊 (uh, not very successfully, 🍋 in this case). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike Hudson, 🍋 Namco didn't try to copy 🍊 the Nintendo-style title screen 🍋 all the time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, their box art 🍋 has its own style. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They eschewed the simple 🍋 cartoon art of Nintendo 🍋 and Hudson games. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If you look at the box art 🍋 for today's Namco games, 🍊 you'll notice something; 🍋 they are sequentially numbered. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Xevious", for example, 🍋 has a large "3" 🍋 in the left corner 🍊 (this being their 🍋 third FamiCom game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not sure why 🍋 this caught on in Japan, 🍊 but several other publishers 🍋 did this as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe they were trying to 🍋 appeal to the collector mentality. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here's the Arcade "Xevious", 🍋 with its much fancier logo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Arcade game obviously had 🍋 different colors and more detail, 🍊 but overall the two games 🍋 look quite a bit alike. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The main difference is 🍋 that, unlike "Pac-Man", 🍊 Namco has expanded 🍋 the game horizontally 🍊 to fit the FamiCom 🍋 screen dimensions. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Xevious" is the first 🍋 Shoot-'em-Up for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 While "Xevious" 🍋 (the Arcade game) 🍊 was not the first 🍋 scrolling Shoot-'em-Up, 🍊 it was the first to 🍋 make a big impression. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Xevious" is one of 🍋 those handful [of] games 🍊 that [pretty] much 🍋 defined a genre. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every vertical Shoot-'em-Up, 🍋 after this, 🍊 was based, more or less, 🍋 on the "Xevious" formula. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So ya fly forward and shoot 🍋 enemy ships before they shoot you 🍊 (really the same basic idea 🍋 as "Space Invaders" or "Galaxian", 🍊 [only] now you have the ability 🍋 to move in any direction 🍊 and enemies are 🍋 constantly coming at you 🍊 and will actually 🍋 fly right past you 🍊 if you don't 🍋 shoot 'em down). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya ever wonder why 🍋 the enemy crafts in these, 🍋 that you don't kill, 🍊 don't simply turn around 🍋 and shoot you from behind? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, where are all these 🍋 guys headed to, anyway? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Apparently, shooting you 🍋 isn't their main priority. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, "Xevious" threw in a nice, 🍋 detailed, scrolling background, 🍊 to make it look like 🍋 you were, like, 🍊 flying over the surface 🍋 of some planet, 🍊 and I think this is 🍋 part of the appeal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike "Galaxian", 🍋 it looked like 🍊 you were actually 🍋 going somewhere. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Maybe, eventually, you would 🍋 reach your destination. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It gave gamers more 🍋 motivation to keep playing 🍊 because they sorta wanna 🍋 see, 'What was ahead?'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, there never 🍋 really was any destination. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you made it to the 🍋 end of the background, 🍊 it simply started over 🍋 from the beginning. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike later Shoot-'em-Ups, 🍋 there's really no end 🍋 to the story of "Xevious". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You just sorta fly around 🍋 in a circle for ever and ever. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You have two weapons in "Xevious": 🍊 a laser for shooting down aircraft and 🍋 a bomb for destroying surface enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The cross-hairs are for 🍋 targeting your bombs. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every so often, like, these 🍋 boss things will appear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These are large armed 🍋 bases on the ground, 🍊 though destroying them 🍋 doesn't really get you anything, 🍋 other than points. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One unusual feature of "Xevious" 🍋 was the adjustable difficulty. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you play more aggressively 🍋 (shooting down lots of enemies) 🍊 the game will throw 🍋 tougher enemies at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can simply avoid 🍋 most enemies, if you wish, 🍊 since they'll fly off screen 🍋 if you don't shoot 'em. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Xevious" was designed by 🍋 someone named Masanobu Endō 🍊 who would, in early days 🍋 of video games, probably be 🍊 the most well-known 🍋 game designer in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Not [only] did he design 🍋 several popular games, 🍊 but he went public, 🍋 appearing on T.V. shows 🍋 and in commercials 🍊 (which was unheard of, 🍋 in Japan, at the time). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll see more of his games 🍋 later in 'Chrontendo'. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Xevious" did eventually get 🍋 a U.S. release by Taxan in 1988. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, in Japan it was one of 🍋 Namco's most successful titles ever, 🍊 selling over a million copies. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Urban Champion 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 November 14 🇯🇵 // 1986 August [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 November 14th has 🍋 two game releases: 🍋 "Urban Champion" and "Mappy". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We'll start with "Urban Champion". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Unlike the last couple 🍋 Nintendo games, 🍊 this was released 🍋 in the United States. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, it still 🍋 wasn't very good 🍊 and seems to have been almost 🍋 completely forgotten today. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Urban Champion" is a 🍋 very early Fighting Game - 🍊 perhaps the second true 🍋 Fighting Game released 🍊 ("Karate Champ" being the first). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were a few, sort of, 🍋 proto-Fighting Games 🍋 that came out earlier, 🍊 and this is, 🍋 uh, [pretty] simple. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is basically 🍋 to hit the other guy. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, despite the fact that 🍋 "Urban Champion" is not held 🍋 in very high esteem, nowadays, 🍊 it did pioneer some 🍋 Fighting Game techniques. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 How it works is this: 🍊 Pressing Up or Down 🍋 on the D-Pad 🍊 will place your hands in the 🍋 higher or lower positions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hitting a button 🍋 will throw a punch 🍊 (either high or low, 🍋 depending on where 🍋 your hands are). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, having your hands 🍋 in the right position 🍋 will block the opponent's punch. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are two punches: 🍊 a fast weak punch and 🍋 a slower more powerful one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Powerful punch will actually 🍋 knock your opponent 🍋 down for a moment. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While "Karate Champ" 🍋 also had blocking, 🍊 "Urban Champion" was 🍋 (as Hardcore Gaming 101 puts it) 🍊 "...the first [Fighting Game] 🍋 to have easily controllable, 🍋 reliable blocking...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can also dodge a punch 🍋 by pressing Back on the D-Pad. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object, here, 🍋 is to push your opponent 🍋 off the screen, 🍊 until he lands in a manhole. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then you'll win the round 🍊 and a random stranger 🍋 will throw confetti on ya. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You [only] have about a minute 🍋 to bask in the confetti-strewn glory, 🍊 since the fight will begin 🍋 [again] a few seconds later. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And so it goes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there's [only] one opponent 🍋 in "Urban Champion". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You may notice 🍋 the game takes place 🍊 in front of such 🍋 tough-guy hangouts as... 🍊 the library and... 🍋 the discount store. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, there are some 🍋 other aspects, however. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Every so often, 🍋 a cop will roll by 🍊 and the fight will 🍋 break up for a moment. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 When you move from 🍋 screen to screen, 🍊 your stamina and time 🍋 will be reset. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Stamina and time are 🍋 not really that important, 🍊 but if your stamina reaches zero, 🍋 you'll be unable to 🍋 fight for a moment. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And if the time runs out, 🍋 the cops will come 🍊 and arrest the opponent 🍋 with the lowest stamina. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Why they [only] arrest the 🍋 guy who's losing the fight, 🍋 I don't know. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Urban Champion" is 🍋 sort of dull and repetitive 🍊 and doesn't have 🍋 many fancy features 🍋 of modern-day Fighters 🍊 (like multiple characters) 🍊 but it definitely has 🍋 its place in the history 🍋 of the Fighting genre. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mappy 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 November 14 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The fourth and final Namco 🍋 game this episode is "Mappy" 🍊 (a port of the 1983 Arcade game, 🍋 which I remember quite well). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Seems like you saw the Arcade 🍋 game quite a bit in the mid-'80s, 🍊 but apparently it was 🍋 more successful in Japan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm not sure why this never 🍋 received any domestic ports, 🍋 back then 🍊 (though the sequel, 🍋 "Mappy-Land", did). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, here's the Arcade game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It used the same board as 🍋 "Super Pac-Man" and "Tower of Druaga" 🍊 (a game that'll come to 🍋 haunt us in the future). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Cute little game, 🍋 upbeat old-timey music... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You control a mouse, Mappy, 🍋 who's trying to round up 🍊 a bunch of goods that were 🍋 stolen by a gang of cats. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, now here's 🍋 the FamiCom version 🍋 (looks quite similar). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The main difference is 🍋 the screen dimensions. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Much more [of] the level 🍋 fits on each screen 🍋 because it's considerably wider. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (It was actually 🍋 the second FamiCom game 🍊 to use horizontal scrolling, 🍋 by the way.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Mappy (despite being 🍋 an officer of the law) 🍋 isn't chasing the thieves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, they're chasing him. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He has some sort of baton, 🍋 but still Mappy can't arrest 🍋 or even try to subdue the cats. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The [only] weapon he has are 🍋 those glowing microwave doors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They shoot out a rather menacing, 🍋 e... uh -- electromagnetic wave 🍊 when opened and this will 🍋 temporarily disable any of the cats. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It'll alsh... -- also 🍋 push you back as well, 🍊 so [you] have to be careful 🍋 when you open those doors. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm sure using such weapons 🍋 on suspects is illegal 🍋 in most countries. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The goal, here, is to 🍋 pick up all the stolen goods 🍊 (T.V.s, copies of the Mona Lisa, 🍋 that sort of thing). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You get bonus rounds 🍋 after every few levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The name 'Mappy' doesn't 🍋 make much sense in English, 🍊 but apparently 'Mapo' is a 🍋 Japanese slang term for a cop. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, this is a 🍋 [pretty] fun little game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you've never played "Mappy", 🍋 I'd say, 'Give it a try.' 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Clu Clu Land 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 November 22 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We've almost reached 🍋 the end of 1984 🍋 (just two more games). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 From November 22nd, 🍋 is "Clu Clu Land". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Much like "Urban Champion", 🍋 it's a game that is not 🍋 so much remembered today. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's sort of a "Pac-Man"-like 🍋 idea ([only] with no maze). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Instead, the challenge comes from 🍋 the sort of weird control scheme. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the odd-looking creature 🍋 that you control is named Bubbles 🍊 and is apparently female 🍋 (not that you can tell). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the things that 🍋 chase after you are, 🍋 I guess, sea urchins. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, here's the deal: 🍋 All those dots? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Those are pegs 🍋 that you can grab onto. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You do this by hitting 🍋 the D-Pad to extend your claw. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You will then revolve 🍋 around the peg 🍋 until you let go. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is how 🍋 you change directions. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is to find 🍋 the hidden gold ingots; 🍊 these are invisible 🍋 until you pass over 'em. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you've found every ingot, 🍋 you've completed the level! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Along the way, of course, 🍊 you'll need to watch out 🍋 for the urchins and 🍋 also those black holes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (There's one in the middle, there.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you touch the black hole, 🍋 you get sucked in and die. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, why are there black holes 🍋 at the bottom of the ocean? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (At least that's where I 🍋 assume this game takes place. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's rather weird.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the urchins - 🍋 you can fortunately shoot 'em, 🍊 uh, with this little weapon 🍋 you have that shoots, like, 🍋 little waves at 'em. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This will temporarily stun them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you then run them down, 🍋 while stunned, they'll die... temporarily. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Just like the "Pac-Man" ghosts, 🍋 they'll come back.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The name 'Clu Clu Land' 🍋 (as you might suspect) 🍊 is one of those names (like 'Mappy') 🍋 that makes more sense to the Japanese. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's an English version 🍋 of "Kuru Kuru" 🍊 (Kuru being that horrible brain 🍋 disease bred through cannibalism, 🍊 so the main subject matter 🍋 is actually [pretty] gruesome). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, an alternate 🍋 (though less interesting) theory 🍊 is that "Kuru Kuru" means, uh, like, 🍋 something spinning around, in Japanese. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's supposedly the sound 🍋 a spinning object makes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the main challenge is 🍋 the unusual method of 🍋 controlling your character. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to hit the D-Pad 🍊 in the direction that corresponds 🍋 to which claw you want to stick out. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're moving up or down, 🍋 this means using the 🍋 Left or Right on the D-Pad. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're moving horizontally, 🍋 then use Up or Down. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Timing can be tricky; 🍋 I've missed a peg many times 🍊 (same with the 🍋 releasing from the peg). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Doing so at the wrong time 🍋 can send you head-first 🍊 into an urchin or a black hole. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is really not that long 🍊 ([only] twenty levels and 🍋 a few bonus levels). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was released on the 🍋 FamiCom Disk System, 🍊 a few years down the road, 🍋 with a few gameplay changes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Clu Clu Land", 🍋 along with "Urban Champion", 🍊 are well-made games 🍋 that really don't, sort of, 🍋 have what it takes 🍊 to be considered 🍋 to be a classic. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 ExciteBike 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1984 November 30 🇯🇵 // 1985 October 18 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Whoa! Look at that! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A blue screen 🍋 instead of a black one. 🍇

✅🏮🍋🍓 Nintendo is getting [pretty] wild. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The last game of 1984 🍋 is one that 🍋 (along with "Duck Hunt") 🍊 is one of the best-remembered 🍋 of these early releases 🍊 (at least in the United States; 🍋 in Japan, I think "Baseball" 🍊 and "Golf" were actually the 🍋 biggest sellers, back then). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, "ExciteBike" 🍋 is a well-designed 🍋 side-view Racing Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Nintendo finally goes all out 🍋 with wall-to-wall horizontal scrolling 🍊 (something we'll see a lot 🍋 more of in the near future). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There are five tracks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The object is to beat a certain time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you do so, you'll move on 🍋 to the next track; 🍊 if not, it's Game Over 🍊 (though from the menu, 🍋 you can choose to play 🍋 any track you'd like). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are 🍋 two acceleration buttons. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A is standard acceleration 🍋 (and is what you'll be using 🍋 most of the time). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 B is some sort of Turbo; 🍋 you go faster, 🍊 but it also heats 🍋 your engine up 🍊 (as per the gauge at 🍋 the bottom of the screen) 🍊 so, use Turbo too much 🍋 and the engine will overheat. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Thankfully, you have those 🍋 little strips with arrows on 'em 🍊 that you see along the 🍋 ground occasionally. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You might think those are, 🍋 like, the "go faster" strips, 🍊 but they actually 🍋 cool your engines. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you can use 🍋 Left or Right on the D-Pad 🍊 to raise or lower 🍋 the front of your bike, 🍊 which is helpful 🍋 when going over hills. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, while "ExciteBike" is 🍋 [pretty] simple, it's [pretty] fun! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The bike controls [pretty] well 🍋 and the Turbo adds a nice little 🍊 risk and, uh, reward 🍋 factor into the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a 🍋 couple other modes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The second regular option 🍋 puts other racers on the track. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This makes things 🍋 a bit harder 🍊 because they keep running into 🍋 you and knocking you down. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Seriously, it's [pretty] tough 🍋 to avoid these guys. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Despite the presence 🍋 of other racers, 🍊 you're not really 🍋 racing them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's still all time-based; 🍊 it doesn't matter whether 🍋 they pass you up or not. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, finally, 🍋 there's a popular Edit Mode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, you can create 🍋 your own tracks 🍋 and then use 'em! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In Japan, players could actually 🍋 save their tracks on cassette, 🍊 using something called 🍋 the FamiCom Data Recorder. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Battery saves had 🍋 not yet been invented.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was one of 🍋 the very few games 🍊 compatible with 🍋 the Data Recorder. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Outside of Japan, 🍋 you were screwed; 🍊 the Save option 🍋 simply didn't work. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So "ExciteBike" 🍋 is a minor classic, 🍋 in its own way, 🍊 and definitely, uh, 🍋 a very good way for 🍋 Nintendo to end this year. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to 1985 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's a pattern we'll be 🍋 seeing in 'Chrontendo': 🍊 a very busy release schedule 🍋 at the end of the year, 🍊 with tons of games 🍋 coming out in November 🍊 and (starting in 1985) 🍋 December as well, 🍊 then very slim pickings 🍋 after the holidays. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In this case, 🍋 the new year's first games 🍊 hit the shelves on the 🍋 fourth week of January, 🍊 with two titles by Nintendo. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Balloon Fight 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1985 January 22 🇯🇵 // 1986 June 03 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Okay, Nintendo's back to the 🍋 standard black background, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First game of 1985 🍋 is "Balloon Fight". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One very notable fact: 🍋 It's the first FamiCom game 🍋 (that I'm aware of) 🍊 by long-time 🍋 Nintendo collaborators, 🍋 HAL Laboratory. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The most notable employee 🍋 of HAL is Satoru Iwata, 🍊 who worked as programmer 🍋 on this game and eventually 🍋 [became] HAL's president. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He then moved to Nintendo 🍋 and, of course, is the current 🍋 president of Nintendo. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you're this little fellow that flies, 🍋 using a couple of balloons tied to his back. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your goal is to clear the screen 🍋 of other flying enemies. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hmm. This reminds me 🍋 a lot of some other game... 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh yes! "Joust", 🍋 from Williams - 🍊 the game where ya fly around 🍋 on ostriches, jousting 🍊 (very popular Arcade game 🍋 in the early 1980s). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The basic concept, controls, 🍋 and even general screen layout 🍊 are all taken 🍋 directly from "Joust" 🍊 and given sort of a cutesy 🍋 Nintendo-esque makeover. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to repeatedly 🍋 press the button 🍊 to flap your arms 🍋 to achieve some height. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 To pop an enemy's balloon, 🍋 you need to hit him from [a] 🍊 slightly higher position 🍋 than he is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Then, as he falls, 🍋 either hit him again 🍋 in mid-air, 🍊 or after he's on the ground. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A mid-air hit will 🍋 net you more points. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you wait too long before 🍋 hitting him the second time, 🍊 he'll actually have enough time 🍋 to re-inflate his balloon. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, some additional 🍋 features have been added, 🍊 such as clouds that'll shoot 🍋 little deadly electrical sparks 🍊 that'll travel around the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And (maybe best of all) 🍊 when someone falls in the water 🍋 a giant fish gobbles them up. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's refreshing to see such a 🍋 horrifying death in a Nintendo game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Additionally, there's 🍋 a bonus round, 🍊 where you try to collect 🍋 as many balloons as possible. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, a few interesting things: 🍊 the 2-Player version allows 🍋 both players on-screen at once 🍊 (much like in 🍋 "Clu Clu Land"). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And a historical tidbit: 🍊 The game was also released 🍋 in arcades on the Versus System, 🍊 however Nintendo programmed 🍋 the Versus System, themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was noticed that the FamiCom 🍋 version had smoother player movement 🍊 so Iwata was asked 🍋 how this was done. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Iwata explained 🍋 the technical trick, 🍊 which Nintendo then 🍋 utilized in later games, 🍋 like "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the final mode simply 🍋 has you drifting around 🍊 a maze of deadly obstacles, 🍋 collecting balloons, 🍊 getting enough points 🍋 to raise your rank. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Most folks don't like 🍋 the, you know, whole 🍊 'swim through narrow passages 🍋 filled with deadly, om, items' 🍊 section of video games, 🍋 but if you dig this sort of thing, 🍊 well then, good for you; 🍋 give this a try. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Overall, it's a [pretty] fun game, 🍋 courtesy of HAL and Nintendo. 🍇🍌

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is it! 🍊 Our last game of this episode: 🍋 "Ice Climber" 🍊 (the second of two games 🍋 released in January 1985). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Already the FamiCom 🍋 is a year and a half old! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was, once again, 🍋 a U.S. launch title 🍊 and a game that a lot [of] 🍋 people fondly remember. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's better than 🍋 "Clu Clu Land", I guess. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So the plot: 🍊 A condor has stolen 🍋 your vegetables 🍊 and you, Popo the Eskimo, 🍋 need to climb a series of mountains 🍋 and get the veggies back. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, why would a bird 🍋 be stealing eggplants? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, seriously, is Popo 🍋 farming eggplants up there 🍋 at the North Pole? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This game makes no sense. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, armed with [only] a hammer, 🍋 Popo must club his way 🍊 through an army 🍋 of dangerous seals. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Wait a second.', you say, 🍋 'You club seals in this game?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, [only] in the 🍋 Japanese version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the U.S. version, 🍋 the seals were replaced 🍋 by these mutant sheep 🍊 (which are supposed to be 🍋 midget Yeti or somethin') 🍊 since the hunting of things like 🍋 seals, whales, and dolphins 🍊 is not really considered 🍋 to be cool in this country. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Right, so you jump 🍋 with one button 🍊 and swing the hammer 🍋 with the other. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One issue pops up very quickly: 🍋 the jumping. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Popo can jump up [pretty] high, 🍋 but doesn't move much horizontally. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You need to have, like, 🍋 a bit of a running jump, 🍊 when moving from 🍋 platform to platform. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Even worse, the edges 🍋 of the platform 🍊 are impossible to land on; 🍋 you will fall right through them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know if this was, like, 🍋 a programming glitch or 🍋 an intentional decision 🍊 but it gets tiring, real quick. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When I see Popo falling 🍋 right through a solid platform, 🍋 over and over, 🍊 it really angry's up the blood. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The bonus part of each level is a 🍋 chance to earn some extra points, 🍊 collect vegetables, 🍋 make your way to the 🍋 top of the mountain, 🍊 and grab the condor. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You will then get a 🍋 'Winner Bonus'. Hurray! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Please note this was developed by 🍋 Nintendo Research and Development 2, 🍊 headed by Gunpei Yokoi. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These are the same guys 🍋 who made "Kid Icarus...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess someone over there has 🍋 [some] sort of thing for eggplants. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, each of the 32 levels 🍋 gets progressively trickier, 🍊 with the usual moving platforms, 🍋 conveyor belts, and so on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Deadly drops of ice 🍋 will form on the ceiling 🍋 and kill you when they fall. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The same idea was 🍋 reused in "Zelda II...". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I think "Ice Climber" would be 🍋 a lot more fun for me 🍊 if it were easier 🍋 to land a jump. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, it's really not fair 🍋 to criticize any sort of 🍊 pre-"Super Mario..." 🍋 Platforming games 🍊 for not having 🍋 "Super Mario..."-style controls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In 1984, I suppose this 🍋 game controlled [pretty] well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One other thing: 🍋 what about the polar bear? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The cover art shows a polar bear 🍋 in sunglasses and a red Speedo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, the crazy cover art 🍋 makes it look sorta like 🍊 Santa Claus is gonna whack 🍋 a polar bear in the nuts 🍋 with a wooden mallet. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, that's a good 🍋 concept for a game, 🍊 but in "Ice Climber" 🍋 the bear appears, [only] 🍊 when you linger on 🍋 one level for too long. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Do that and he'll casually 🍋 walk out and jump, and 🍋 lower everything by one level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're on the bottom level 🍋 when he does this, ya die! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This sort of puts an invisible 🍋 time limit on each level. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, despite its flaws, 🍋 "Ice Climber" is a [pretty] 🍋 good little game, 🍊 so we're gonna 🍋 finish up "...Episode 2" 🍋 on a relatively positive note. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 2 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, we've now reached 🍋 the beginning of 1985, 🍊 which will be a huge 🍋 banner year for Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Consider this: 🍋 Nine games were released in 1983, 🍊 then nineteen in 1984, 🍊 and then in 1985 🍋 a huge jump to sixty-eight 🍊 (all thanks to more publishers 🍋 coming on board). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "...Episode 3" will cover 🍋 up to June 1985 🍊 and see four more publishers 🍋 join the party, 🍊 including two successful 🍋 Arcade manufacturers. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, see you then! 🍇🍌
