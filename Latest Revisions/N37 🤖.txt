👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 37 ✨


🍓 Hey! "Chrontendo Episode 37" is here at last (though very very late). 

🤖🍪🍊🍓 but it's a big ol' massive episode, featuring a classic Adventure Game, a whacked out R.P.G., a Japanese Adventure Game from Capcom, and some FamiCom Disk System junk. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the exciting thing is the "1988 Arcade Round-Up". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! Just like the "1987 Arcade Round-Up", we'll take a look at the biggest bestest games to hit Arcades in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This allows us to not [only] to compare contemporary Arcade Games with what was happening on FamiCom, but we'll also be seeing a lot [of] games that later will get ported to consoles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, let's get started! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 America Daitouryou Senkyo/United State Presidential Race 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hector 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hector 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 From Hector (or Hect) we have "America Daitouryou Senkyo" (or "United State [Presidential Race]", as the cover says), which is a 1988 presidential election Simulation Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, you heard that right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Good timing, I suppose, since it came out right before the election. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The intro will show us the candidates. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have Bush (as in George Herbert Walker). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sasha? (Is this supposed to be Margaret Thatcher? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 She's described as a senator from Michigan). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Roberts, (that'd be Pat Robertson, the televangelist). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also, of course, Michael Dukakis. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Jesse Jackson. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And finally, 'Suzuki' (a fictional senator from California). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, the U.S. Wikipedia claims Al Gore is among the candidates, but he isn't listed in the intro. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, either Wikipedia is wrong (imagine that!) or he's like a hidden character or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you pick your character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll choose Bush, I guess. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's his stats, including his blood type (naturally). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And oh, yes, he's a WASP (in case you didn't know that). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess WASP is a readily understood acronym in Japan? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a little surprising. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here you begin your grueling year-long campaign. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya know, there's actually very little in this game in terms of graphics, but the artwork on the faces is [pretty] good! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was supposedly developed by Hector themselves. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya need to choose your position on number of issues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll select environment, and in the sub choices I'll go for air pollution regulation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For each issue you need to, like, move your elephant (in this case) along the bar to indicate whether you lean in favor of it or against it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will affect how much certain groups in the populace will favor you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one here is automobile import restrictions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a whole bunch of Japan-based issues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Thatcher is described as being anti-Japan and Suzuki is pro-Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Japan actually figures heavily in this election. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is almost entirely text-based. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It sort of resembles the Stock Market Games, like "Wall Street Kid", except with voter popularity replacing wealth. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I wonder, who was this aimed at? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 An older audience, I assume, since the game contains massive amounts of kanji. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whereas most games just use hiragana, which is easier for kids to read. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow! The game's just started; I'm already in the lead. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really, a quite baffling game and the inclusion of Margaret Thatcher in the election adds a surreal touch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So an interesting game, but one that's going to be impossible to play unless you're very familiar with kanji. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Yuu Maze/Youmais 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Moving right along, we have our first F.D.S. game, this episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 From Taito, "Yuu Maze" (which means "maze play", perhaps?). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Clear the labyrinth and rescue your brother. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So don't expect any heavy duty plot here, folks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a few options including the options to create your own maze. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, once the game begins... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow! So this really is a Maze Game - an old-school game where ya run around a maze and try not to get hit! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are different colors of dots, though the [only] difference here seems to be the more points they give. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And those swirly-looking fan blade things are warps; you can warp from one to the other. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After clearing the maze of dots, you will then move on to the next round! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] simple-lookin' game, huh! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously this would have been [pretty] cool back in 1981, but... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it could even have passed as an early pre-'...Mario...' FamiCom game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But releasing such a game in late 1988 seems a little perverse. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe this was a deliberate attempt at a retro game? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game does add a few elements, as you progress, power-ups that let you kill enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are gray dots that turn green when you run them over, and then you have to run them over again in order to pick them up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game also gets harder with some enemy vehicles moving much faster than you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Yuu Maze" is not exactly terrible but (as I've previously noted) Taito really seems to be dedicated to underachievement when it comes to its FamiCom releases. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And "Yuu Maze" certainly fits into that pattern. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 A Couple of Significant Historical Notes ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A couple of significant historical notes here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First of all, October 29th marks an important day in videogame history, since that was the day that Sega (despite not having much luck with the Master System) launched a new console, the Sega Mega Drive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was right about a year after the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, unlike that console, the Mega Drive was undoubtedly a full 16-bit system. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually the Mega Drive would find in great success in the U.S. as the Genesis, as well as in Europe and elsewhere. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But in Japan the Mega Drive didn't draw that much attention and Sega's new console took third place in the Japanese console wars (after the FamiCom and the P.C. Engine). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, Nintendo managed to steal whatever thunder Sega had, a month later. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the last year or so there had been talk of Nintendo's own 16-bit project, known as the Super FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Finally, on November 22nd, Nintendo publicly unveiled the new system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A demonstration was held that day for the Japanese press. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The console shown that day was, from a technical standpoint, very similar to the final version of the Super FamiCom, except that it had much less memory. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, by late 1988, the Super FamiCom was [pretty] much complete. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's a little surprising that it wasn't actually released until late 1990! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the FamiCom was so successful there that Nintendo didn't want to render it obsolete when was still making money. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So for the next two years, Nintendo will just tantalize gamers with peeks at the new system. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, the fact that Nintendo had a 16-bit system ready by 1988 shows that the end of the 8-Bit era really is upon us. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 San Goku Shi 🇯🇵 // Romance of the Three Kingdoms 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 30 🇯🇵 // 1989 October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Koei 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Koei 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've seen plenty of Military Strategy Games for the FamiCom over the last 11 months or so. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And now for the big one - the granddaddy of them all, "San Goku Shi", from Koei - the first in a series of about a million games based on the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, much like "Nobunaga's Ambition", Koei did a crazy thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They translated into English and released it on the under the main "Romance of The Three Kingdoms". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you fire up the game, you'll need to make some choices from a variety of options starting with picking one of the five scenarios, each based on a point in time, during the late Han Dynasty (or the Three Kingdoms period). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, you need to choose who you want to play as. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are some of the major figures of this period. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll go with, uh, Cao Cao (perhaps the most famous Warlord of the period). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Oh, and this game is for up to eight players at once, by the way!). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, so far, this works very much like "Nobunaga's Ambition"! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (You've gotta choose your stats, here.). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But first, let's do a little bit of, uh, backstory to this game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, we just saw Namco game called "Sangokushi" a few episodes ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, here's a reminder about there being two different literary works with similar titles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The earliest one will be called "The Record of Three Kingdoms" in English. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a rather dry historical document. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this game is technically named after this book. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much more well-known, is the later fictionalized version, called "Romance of The Three Kingdoms". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's considered to be one of the four classic Chinese novels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, technically the Japanese and English titles for this game refer to different works. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But they both tell the same story, so it's no big deal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game its first appearance on the P.C.-88 in 1985. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then it was ported to other Japanese computers, including the M.S.X. (seen here). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These Computer versions all look [pretty] similar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the console version isn't really that much different. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Sangokushi" was, I believe, Koei's first historic Strategy Game, and it sorta set the template for many of their later games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the N.E.S. game wasn't even the first English release! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Romance of The Three Kingdoms" came out for DOS computers in 1988 and for the Amiga a little later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The graphics were different! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the DOS version there's, uh, [pretty] much no music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game works much better on a P.C. than a console. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Strategy Games were [pretty] popular on Computers, at the time so a DOS release makes perfect sense. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, here's the main map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I control number seven - though the map doesn't tell you that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 you have to remember which section corresponds to which warlord. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 From your main control screen, you choose what you wanna do for your turn. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 View allows you to see the other words (or 'Masters', as the game calls them). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can check on their territory for info on their money, army, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can conduct war, or diplomacy, or you can give gifts, marry off your daughters to another warlord, recruit men for your army. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Search has you look around the territory for interesting people to recruit as generals. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 See, here I'm training my men, thus increasing their strength in battle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But also very important in this campaign is moving your men into unoccupied lands. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, uh, territory number 6 is not under my control (or any other warlords). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I can This chick in general and some men and basically just move right in! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to spend money and rice to do so. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But having more land produces more rice. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the expansion part of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You just sorta build up your wealth and your army. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing you probably should not do is make the CPU's battles visible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise, whenever two CPU-controlled warlords fight, you're gonna get stuck watching an endlessly long battle between the two. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I couldn't find any way to get it to stop, either. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Battles are, unfortunately, rather simple and very slow. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya [only] have one type of unit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you can attack enemies in two different fashions: just sort of attack them outright - or set fire to the square where they're sitting on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably the most unusual feature is ya to bring rice with you to battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you run out, you lose the battle! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or, if your rice supply gets captured, you lose! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, once you put the rice down, it can't be moved (because apparently supply wagons hadn't been invented yet in second country, China... or something). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 in that particular battle, one of the generals was Lu Bu, who was one [of] the major badasses in the book and supposedly one [of] the major badasses of Chinese history. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, the battles move very slowly! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The camera has to crawl around the battlefield from the front lines to your base (where rice is kept) so you can hit Pass on the unit defending the rice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The same is true for the enemy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's a lot of dead time watching enemy units pass on their turn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Romancing The Three Kingdoms" isn't quite a classic 4X-style Strategy Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no Exploration really, no Resources to collect (other than rice). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to spend some money improving your territories and keeping your generals loyal and your population happy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the information isn't always displayed in a helpful way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main nap won't tell ya which territories belong to who, for example, other than through color coding. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's not a key to that on the map screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, ya sorta have to, like, look up who's who on the map screen, or write it down, or just... try to remember it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is certainly an important game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Koei built [pretty] much their entire empire on it! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the Strategy Game mania hitting the FamiCom in 1988 can be traced back directly to this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But for those who have been spoiled by 'Civilization' games or other modern Strategy Games, you might find it just a little bit too unpolished. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Touhou Kenbun Roku 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 10 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Natsume 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Natsume 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Natsume! Oh really? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 this is the first game we've seen from Natsume, who would later go on to greater things, such as 'Harvest Moon', Lufia, and the 'Pocky and Rocky' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know if it's literally their first game, but it's definitely the first published console game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing I'll say, right off the bat: "Touhou Kenbun Roku" has some of the most interesting music we've seen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll discuss one particular piece of music later, but for now check out all the wacky Sci-Fi sounds, during the intro. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is one of those nutty Japanese games that mixes up Sci-Fi and history and then throws in a healthy dose of surreal humor to make a deliberately goofy game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy from futuristic Japan gets sent back to the year 1275 and meets Marco Polo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game's title, the name 'Touhou Kenbun Roku' is what the book "The Adventures of Marco Polo" is called in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, the game does not actually resemble Marco Polo's real life travels at all, as far as I can tell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game's box describes it as a New Wave psychedelic adventure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we have some more examples of the game's musical pastiche of different styles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Touhou Kenbun Roku" has a very similar idea to last episode's "Erika to Satoru..." game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are two characters (Marco and Bun Rocco) and you switch between them from time to time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not a new idea; but I guess it adds a bit of character to the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it probably needs it, because the game's appeal is going to have to be based on the character in the story. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because the gameplay uses the same completely typical Look, Talk, and Move pattern found in just about every other Japanese Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's, sort of, disappointing that Japanese Adventure Games all adhere so closely to this style! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you took, like, a random handful of Western Adventure Games of this period (say "Police Quest" "Maniac Mansion" and "Deja Vu"), they're all completely different in how they play and look! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, for the FamiCom, an Adventure Game (whether it's from Nintendo, Namco, or Natsumi) - they all look just about the same. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the password screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's cool that it uses bugs and shells and eyeballs instead of letters, but check out the music! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a Hebrew song called Maya Mayam, which apparently most younger Japanese folks at the time would have been exposed to in school. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The tune was later used in Konami's Shoot-'em-Up "Sexy Parodius". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and that version became the basis for incredible number of mash-up videos based on the song. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example... 🍇🍌



🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or, on the other hand, we have this... 🍇🍌



🤖🍪🍊🍓 seriously, if you go to YouTube or NicoNico and look up Maya Mayam, you'll find tons of these things, most of which are very annoying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What's the deal with this song? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But "Touhou Kenbun Roku" was perhaps the first game to actually use this song. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Know, if nothing else, it was ahead of its time, in that regard. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 American Football 🇯🇵 // Touchdown Fever 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 11 🇯🇵 // 1991 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SNK 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by KAC 🇯🇵 // SNK 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, we've got three games on November 11th - all of them sort of terrible! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First up, is one from SNK, who are still in their pre-NeoGeo run of crappy games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's called "Touchdown Fever". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like some earlier SNK games, this was released by KAC in Japan and then later by SNK themselves, in the United States. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this would be the second American Football Game for the FamiCom (the other being "10-Yard Fight"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But don't fear, Football fans, we have a much better Football Game coming up in the next few months. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like so many of the SNK FamiCom games, this was originally an Arcade title - one which use some [pretty] nifty speech samples. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sports Games really seem to like speech samples, I've noticed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade Game used button mashing to make your player run - and a weird football-shaped joystick to move and throw the ball around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't think it was a huge hit, but SNK naturally ported it to the FamiCom and N.E.S. anyway. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start off choosing from several pro football teams which are identified [only] by their city names. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the kickoff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 SNK couldn't be bothered to draw a shadow on the ball, while it's in the air. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's been pointed out that the field is huge compared to the players. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It takes them about a second to run one yard, which means they run at about (what?) maybe 2 Miles Per Hour. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So these guys must be like really, really tiny! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have a few different play options to choose from, but these aren't really formations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The offense and defense just sorta lined up randomly, each play. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, passing is difficult because the other team can intercept passes very, very easily. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Touchdown Fever" doesn't really seem to factor in the altitude of the ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So a pass can be intercepted by someone when it really should be sailing way over their heads. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The running options are probably your best bet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I couldn't really figure it out how to use any sort of logic or strategy in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole thing actually confused me to no end. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not even sure what the Japanese name of this game is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The box says "American Football" in huge letters, but the title screen simply says "Touchdown Fever". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's definitely the worst Football Game we've seen so far. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This wasn't released in the U.S. until 1991. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it had already been rendered obsolete by better games before it even hit the shelves! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gambler Jiko Chuushinha 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Game Arts | Yellow Horn | Bits Lab 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Asmik 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Released the same day as "Touchdown Fever" is "Gambler Jiko Chuushinha", the first FamiCom game from Asmik. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Looks like that logo is flipping me off. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey! That looks kinda like the octopus from the Parodius games! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You may have seen some of the other names on the title screen, Game Arts and Yellow Horn. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Game Arts are the guys behind "Thexder". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Yellow Horn is just some obscure development company who I don't know anything about. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The port was apparently done by Bits Laboratory, who specialized in porting Computer Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also worked on the FamiCom version of "Thexder". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is actually a rather striking and vibrant opening. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But we don't really understand the squiggle below his sunglasses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is that supposed to be his nose? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Couldn't be his mouth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But either way I like the big thick black lines used in drawing the character. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, guess what? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a Mahjong game - one with a lot of characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Before you start the game, you get this lengthy character roll call. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It just goes on and on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh! Is that the Terminator? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, this is based on a manga from the 1980s which never seems to have received an animated version and doesn't seem very well remembered today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Regardless, there were a lot of Mahjong video games, based on the character, starting with the Japanese Computer Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the M.S.X. version - [pretty] much the same opening. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom version was given a bit of a graphic makeover, but this M.S.X. version is [pretty] much the same as the one we're looking at today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the FamiCom one has three game options, including a story mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe the object here is to defeat each of the other characters in Mahjong games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and uses a password save system. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I've said before, there were tons of Mahjong games released in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And these are gonna be difficult to cover, since I don't really understand the rules very well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this game is apparently based on an even more difficult variation of Mahjong. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This looks just like the typical Mahjong video games [of] the time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, it seems to have some sort of auto-play mode, since the game started, sort of, choosing tiles for me, all by itself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this, plenty more 'Gambler Jiko Chuushinha' games came out on various systems, right up through the PlayStation era. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of the very last for the Saturn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All the women are drawn with the same blank stare and open mouth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's kinda creepy-lookin'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are way more characters to choose from. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the game itself looks like just a regular old Mahjong game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it doesn't even really seem that different from the FamiCom game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess they decided not to mess with a successful formula. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that's "Gambler Jiko Chuushinha" for ya. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since we've now officially reached the Japanese holiday video game rush, expect to see a lot more of this kind of thing in the next few episodes. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Saiyuuki World 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Westone | NMK 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, we're going deep into obscure Japanese game territory here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jaleco makes its first of two appearances today with "Saiyuuki World". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmm. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Yuki sounds familiar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Was that that song by que Sakamoto? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No wait so Yuki is the Japanese title for the Chinese novel that we call Journey to the West? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We bought two games today based on classic Chinese novels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now you might recall another set up game "...Super Monkey Daibōken" the worst FamiCom game of all time (or at least that we've seen so far). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well sigh Yuki worlds for plumbed those depths but let's take a look. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 looks like a standard of walking stab game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Characters based on some Goku it seems. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have a status and inventory screen where you can see all your equipment, items, collected money, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy gives you a sword or rather a little putty knife. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can now kill enemies and pick up some Gold. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and you often be entering buildings and talking to people. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 bought the shops to buy armor items. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Part of this looks [pretty] typical, but I can't help but feel this somehow it looks familiar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not just generally speaking, but I think I've played this game before. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's see. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes, "Wonder Boy" and monster land the Arcade Game from Sega and Westone, important to the Sega Master System. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you keyword is not dissimilar that game, it's [pretty] much an exact copy right down to the enemy sprites. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It looks like Jaleco just took the game and just change the character sprites. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The thing was, this is actually the second time this has happened. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because the man world was a launch title on the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hudson had licensed the rights for the game from Westone, but altered all the characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So did Jaleco do the same thing? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Did they pay Westone for the game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or were they just create the most blatant game ripoff ever? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If so, why didn't they get sued? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or maybe they did? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And why is m Ks name on the title screen? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 would They have to do with this? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, I really couldn't find much info as to how you feel and to be like can't really answer the whole 'rip-off or license game?' question. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If this is a rip-off it's [pretty] amazing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way both the P.C. Engine game and the Masters ism game look much better than this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there's real No need to actually try to play so you play well. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Samurai Sword 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 let's fire up the F.D.S. here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and we have "Samurai Sword". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I know it sounds like a Fighting Game such as "Samurai showdown" or "Bushido blade" but it's not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It is however one of the virtue F.D.S. games from Capcom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We also have a great English translation by mute. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this guy named Sauron is causing all sorts of trouble and [only] one guy can stop him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wait, I have to stop. So run? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll see about that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So my sword throws you right in the action with like an R.P.G. style battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it's one of those battles that you can't actually plan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm sure you've seen those form R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 prepping stuff here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sauron certainly, sort of, looks like your standard R.P.G. type villain. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wait nine delight means? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, it turns out the game is actually a traditional Japanese Adventure Game (though one with [pretty] high production values). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To look around and find some elves or so small, they can fit your hand. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a really small elves. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe they're really fairies or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Normal action commands appear - look, and move, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you walk around, the [only] thing you can really interact with is this bar in the middle of the woods. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I can't imagine they get much business. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 talk to them, and they'll tell you they lost their key, which is conveniently lying around on the ground nearby. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] simple, but after you give them back the key, nothing really happens until you have to commit one specific action in order to break out of the pattern of repeating the same dialogue over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 just randomly start using them and until we happen to reach the take the liquor option, and then they'll start talking again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will also learn that liquor makes elves friendly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmm. Okay. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which brings us to a problem with "Samurai Sword" another Japanese Adventure Games: there's an extreme linearity imposed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, for example, you find a hole in a tree and a bird. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You scare with the bird but there's nothing Be Found afterwards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you examine it says there's nothing unusual. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, the elf King is missing and trapped here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But he doesn't actually appear until you give the elves the liquor and they tell you the King is missing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then and [only] then, does he magically appear by the tree of the hole. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 every interaction has to be done in a certain predetermined order. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This makes the game very illogical. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 and moving on you encounter a giant needle in a cave. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are occasional battles in "Samurai Sword", but there's always [only] one way to beat them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we have to use magic to damage the needle shell and then slow it down is another magic spell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your companion girl has various magic spells which change depending on the situation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here bolt appears, so use that to kill the needle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again the game is for the lead to that particular path. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is not much choice involved. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Samurai Sword" feels a lot like "Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom" or "Ripple Island" Since there are discrete levels, which you handle in a particular order. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 you can't backtrack to earlier areas, and you can't afford until you've completed certain tasks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a section where you drove by a weary traveler on the robot giving him water, Just like Percy and "Princess tomato". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though this guy doesn't follow you around Afterwards; he just dies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I wouldn't call "Samurai Sword" a difficult game, but you can die if you don't pull them the correct actions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 made to run from a zombie or instantly kill you by hugging you to death. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's not normally how zombies kill folks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both the zombies and the elder this game kind of weird. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 for that matter, why is it even called "Samurai Sword". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 doesn't appear to take place in Japan and your character in the samurai, as far as I know. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think there's actual "Samurai Sword" weapon later in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's just another standard Adventure Game no, we're reasonably nice looking one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nothing too interesting aside from Capcom's name on it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Quiz: 4-nin wa Rival 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 16 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Athena 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Athena 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The holiday season is going to bring out a number of new publishers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have three this episode - Natsumi, Asmik, And now Athena, who were probably best known for the 'desert eemaan' games, which are those Shoot-'em-Up Crater games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Family quiz, however, is just a plain old minigame collection based around trivia questions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So again with the bunny girls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 what is Japan's obsession with girls and bunny suits? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We just saw one in "gambler de cocina". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To choose how many players (up to four), difficulty, and game type. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 the first game is like a standard game show setup. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first-person hit the buzzer can answer the question. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The answer is take a second to display so you can't hit the buzzer too quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you do answer correctly, Your chair will be lifted up along the wall, the first one to the top wins. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The next game is basically Othello. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 he answer a question correctly and you can put a piece down. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object, of course, (just like real Othello) is to surround your opponents. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then we have this, sort of, very simple Board Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 answering correctly will win you a dice spin. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and you try to get to the center of the board. 🍇🍌



🤖🍪🍊🍓 And finally, we have a memory game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because there's really nothing special or interesting going on here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just another quickie from a tiny publisher. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is [only] around 130 kilobytes, so it's a really small card by 1988 standards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He probably could have squeezed it onto the F.D.S. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 The Chrontendo 1988 Arcade Round-Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey! Guess what time it is! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 time for another 'Chrontendo' special feature. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 in this case, the "1988 Arcade Round-Up", in the fine tradition of the "1987 Arcade Round-Up" from "Chrontendo Episode 24". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# Intro: 1988 Isn't As Iconic as 1987 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 1987 introduced Arcade titles, such as "Contra", "Double Dragon", and "R-Type" - all enormously influential and beloved games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 1988 has plenty of cool games, but nothing quite as genre-defining as those I just mentioned. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As before, this is certainly not every Arcade Game released this year. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 but it does cover the big hits (the important games, in my opinion) as well as various representative titles. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Sega ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Altered Beast ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's start with our old buddy Sega and their "Altered Beast" - the first game for furries. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a pre-"Renegade" single-plane Beat-'em-Up with one special gimmick. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You collect power-ups, which alter your physical appearance to get bigger and beefier, eventually transforming you into a super powerful half human half animal creature. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's one of the more well-known Sega games from 1988, probably due to its Genesis port being a pack-in game for that console for a little while. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 not as well-known And but still very awesome is "Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair" designed by WestOne. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's it's, sort of, halfway between "Wonder Boy" and "Wonder Boy in Monster Land", in terms of gameplay in general style. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It loses monster lands R.P.G. elements and instead tosses in some Shoot-'em-Up sequences. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Overall the game is very fun and visually very appealing - one of the better Sega games we're gonna see this episode. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Galaxy Force II ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other hand, "Galaxy Force" is one of the lesser known entries in Sega is Super Scaler 3D games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it's almost completely forgotten compared to stuff like "Space Harrier" and "AfterBurner". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It does look a lot like "AfterBurner" in space, I suppose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, look at this! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's just like "Gradius II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, this part is [pretty] cool. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Power Drift ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Better remembered today is "Power Drift" - [pretty] decent go kart Racing Game, which is sorta like "OutRun" on steroids. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 want to have impressive spike based 3D effects and the tracks have lost of twists and turns, hills, and all kinds of surprises. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sega has really added a vertical element to the game, as opposed to just horizontal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Galaxy Force II", it's one impressive looking game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it was a solid year for Sega. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 but nothing really that innovative or special came out of it. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Konami ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Vulcan Venture // Gradius II ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Moving on to Konami, in 1988, they released a sequel to their 1985 classic Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Gradius II" (called "Vulcan Venture" in some areas), gives you choices of different kinds of weapons and shields and introduces the wonderful pulse laser. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Gradius II" the huge graphic upgrade of the first game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 check out the giant fire serpents. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This would have blown the minds of "Gradius" fans the first time they played this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and bosses are also much more interesting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And still stupidly hard, however, even more More so than the first "Gradius". 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Super Contra ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 another Konami sequel here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "What is this place?" 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Keep your eyes peeled." 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! "Super Contra", a much more over-the-top sequel to 1987's huge hit, "Contra". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This introduces the "Contra" traditions of really flashy weapons and huge explosions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It also ditched those 3D-like hallway sections of "Contra". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is it better than the first game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it's certainly louder and more frenetic. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸'88 Games ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And another sequel, "'88 Games", the "Track & Field" sequel that is completely different than "Track & Field II" released for the FamiCom and N.E.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Konami just loved speech samples at this time.). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really just "Track & Field" with upgraded graphics, some new events, and much uglier characters. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The Main Event✨

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "The Main Event" - is (not surprisingly) a Wrestling Game, though not officially based on the WWF Main Event T.V. show that was very popular at this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The look and feel is clearly inspired by WWF wrestling, however. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But again, there's lots of speech samples, and the game engine was later used for "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" - the first game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Konami seemed to, sort of, focus on bigger and better sequels in 1988. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Taito ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Superman ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taito was still pumping out tons of Arcade Games in '88, despite (in my opinion) gradually diminishing relevance. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Check this out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How does he take off his pants? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Superman" is yet another single-plane Beat-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though you can fly, meaning you can move up and down on the screen at will. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not a great game, but it's interesting, since there weren't a whole lot of comic book superhero games at this time. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Kabuki Z ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now check out this intro. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Good lord! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's gotta be the most gruesome video game intro ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How could they even get away with that? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Kabuki Z" is a bizarre weapons-based, Beat-'em-Up that you probably never heard of. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It does have "Renegade"-style multi-plane action, however. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, your character can move around while kneeling, which looks really awkward. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's bizarre game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Kageki ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And speaking of bizarre it's "Kageki" one of the ugliest looking Fighting Games of all time, this side of "Pit Fighter". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And man, look at those gigantic heads! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One-on-One Fighting Games are not too common at this time and games like "Kageki" show you why. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fighting is very button mashy and has very little in common with later Capcom and SNK games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, just like "Kabuki Z", the whole thing sorta seems really weird, somehow. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Operation Thunderbolt ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah, yes! The Middle Eastern terrorists - a common Boogeyman in the 1980s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hey! I see the Mediterranean! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is "Operation Thunderbolt", the sequel to "Operation Wolf", which throws in some sequences where you move forward rather than do side to side. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather distastefully, this is named after a real-life military action, in which an Israeli strike team went to Uganda to rescue hostages whose jet had been hijacked. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was a real classy move, Taito. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Enforce ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the Taito goes for the strike-based 3D with "Enforce", one of the first games on their fancy new Taito Z board (also used for "Continental Circus" and "Chase HQ"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess you'd call this a Rail Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And your weapon on the right looks like the chain gun from "Wolfenstein 3D". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 like some of the other games that we're seeing today, you can really see the industry, sort of, moving towards 3D games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still [pretty] impressive looking. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Chuka Taisen ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the other side of the fence, technologically speaking, we have "Chuuka Taisen", sometimes called Cloud master a rather old-fashioned Shoot-'em-Up by 1988 standards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those have cool backgrounds really like crystal Chinese paintings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It is seems somehow not very special compared to something like radius two (Both have giant fire in bosses). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸The NewZealand Story ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the most fondly remembered title game of 1988 was "New Zealand story" (Another adorable game in the "Bubble Bobble" rainbow Island style). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It plays a little Kiwi rescuing his friends from walrus New Zealand story was ported to many different systems and we'll definitely encounter this game later on. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Capcom + IREM ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Ghouls 'n' Ghosts ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Capcom also gets all sequel happy with ghouls and ghosts, the sequel to their pioneering 1985 Platformer, "Ghosts 'n Goblins". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great intro here, Princess Prince Brent is kidnapped again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's basically just the same awesomeness of the first game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Plus a few new things like armor upgrades and a magician that turns into a helpless old man, which really, really sucks when that happens to you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Check out these cool wind effects physics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 so gorgeous looking game and also really hard (as you would expect from those statistics. Bastards at Capital). 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Forgotten Worlds ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So capital is definitely behind Konami in that speech sample department. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 forgotten worlds of the call up your side arms (posting horizontal shooting lumps that lie to reverse face at will and shooting either direction). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, we have the R.P.G. elements tossed in (like shops by power-ups). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 on a huge classic but still a reasonably cool game nonetheless. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Last Duel ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot less interesting was there Vertical Shooter last tool. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Capcom ops released a new version of 1943 this year in terms of generic games like Capcom bowling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Overall, ghouls and ghosts with Capcom is a big highlight. of 1988. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Image Fight ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And speaking of Shoot-'em-Ups, Image Fight was Irem 1988 entering the genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 to produce a game with weapons pods and what are types, but a bit disappointing after the overall incredible awesomeness that was archived. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next year I released x multiply. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Image Fight is bookended by two much more interesting games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 firewalls released vigilante that year, which we looked at "Chronsega Episode 6", but really nothing else. Very interesting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kind of a quiet year for Irem. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Namco ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Splatterhouse ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now you know who had a busy year Namco most notoriously was splatterhouse, one of the first really gruesome horror themed Arcade Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They play at some point he was stuck in a haunted house and possessed by demonic khaki mask. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 clearly inspired by Jason from "Friday the 13th" you can do stuff like pick the meat cleaver and whack the heads off monsters and rehab and corpses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 also notable is the minimalistic Looney music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's really all kinds of icky stuff in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 splatterhouse is definitely the glorious, slimy, highest and most horrific Arcade Game in existence in 1988. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Mirai Ninja // Cyber Ninja ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namco just released a 16-bit Namco system 187 and later in the year they debuted the system to what "Final Lap". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This board is capable of threat rotation, stretching, and so on. Much like the later Super N.E.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Cyber ninja is not a very interesting game, but it does employ a few weird side effects. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Assault ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was sold assault is again not the greatest game ever but definitely shows off system to sprite handling capabilities. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 according to Wikipedia was the first game ever to use something called quote massive sprite rotation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 you can do a lot of stuff like this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 also had a double joystick tank like control. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Ordyne ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 or dine is almost like a cube up version of forgotten worlds. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 is a world Shooter with an R.P.G. elements. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 like so many games this episode it's really not that low remember today, but it's really no surprise you if you are saying things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 like its rotation effects when this boss is going down here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 or this section right here we have to navigate through these this maze of background objects. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Phelios ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 are finally In the 'Namco shows off its new board' category is healios. Another game that you probably haven't played. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a Greek mythology themed Vertical Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it's frequently moving, rotating, and resizing backgrounds are [pretty] impressive. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Winning Run ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, later in the year Namco released something called the system 21 (their first board that produced a polygon based 3D). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 in 1980 Racing Game called winning run uses system 21. But this is sadly not yet emulated, and you can't even find footage of this game on YouTube. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's it's virtually a lost game at the moment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But Namco definitely has the technological advantage among Japanese game manufacturers this year. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Atari Games ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Vindicators ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now let's switch gears and take a look at the American Arcade scene. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Atari Games is probably the dominant force at this time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 vindicators is a [pretty] simple top-down paint game which is some digitized graphics (much like the 1980s men's blast droids). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 you Also as tank controls much like assault. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Overall though it's not particularly noteworthy. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Cyberball ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now cyber ball on the other hand is a futuristic Football Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Having a unique four player cabinet with dual screens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 the players are all robots and the ball can actually explode while you're holding it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And just like vindicators not really many folks number of finally today. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Hard Drivin' ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tori's main achievement at this time was something called hard driving. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was notable for being the second ever polygon based 3D Arcade Game. (The first being Atari is AI robot, which incredibly came out back in 1983). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while this is not very exciting to look at today, this would have been quite unique and striking in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hard driving long with Namco is winning run officially initiated the 3D era in arcades. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As we'll see in the 1988 Computer Game round-up. 3D games are slowly making their way to the homes as well. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Tetris ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes And let's not forget Atari released a little game called "Tetris" into arcades in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was, of course, originally in 1985. game released for Soviet computers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 reach home computers in the U.S. in 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in 1988, it hit the arcades. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tari would release on N.E.S. versions of pingan in 1989, which, as you may have heard, caused a wee bit of a dust up between Nintendo and Tengan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll hear more about that later, however. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But guess who also released a "Tetris" Arcade Game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sega? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, there was wasn't as it wasn't tarries. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not sure either version caused too much excitement in the arcades. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this was, of course, the calm before the "Tetris" storm of 1989. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Williams ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸NARC ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Williams, who was once a big time Arcade player didn't lose much of interest in '88 beyond dark. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and look at that guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Designed by Eugene Jarvis of defender robotron fame narc is a charmingly reactionary game in which you play a some sort of government sanctioned vigilante on a mission simply kill every drug dealer at Atlas down the street. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like Atari, Williams was experimenting with digitized graphics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 so we can, sort of, see a Golden opening between the aesthetic sensibilities of Western and Japanese game manufacturers. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Smaller Publishers ✨


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Magic Johnson's Fast Break ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Elsewhere the U.S. Arcade Game was not really too hot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Lots of undistinguished Sports Games such as magic Johnson's past break from Arcadia. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anybody remember this game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably not. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸John Elway's Team Quarterback ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or john Elway's team quarterback from Leland. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The era of celebrity athletes putting their names on video games was just slowly dawning at this point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This looks like cyber ball [only] with worse graphics and without the robots. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Cabal ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Back in Japan, there were a number Interesting games from smaller manufacturers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 cabal from Tad Corporation was a rather unique Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There was a little Light Gun Game that was controlled with a joystick. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And he moved your character the crosshairs at the same time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And despite the fact that your character was some sort of super military tough guy, he did this dance after beating each level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 and lots of on screen objects were destructible walls, buildings, everything. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 overall was a [pretty] cool game. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Atomic Robo-Kid ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 UPL came out with a Horizontal Shooter called tonic Robo kid. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The rebel kid himself is inconveniently large and chunky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But fortunately hitting enemies doesn't actually kill you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It just slows you down some. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 also we could face either direction like inside arms or God world. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's not the best looking game ever. It didn't have a cool, sort of, biomechanical feel to it. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Double Dragon II: The Revenge ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Technos Japan was becoming the go to guys for Beat-'em-Up to this time, and naturally they would put a sequel to their monster hit event tastes Have a "Double Dragon". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A "Double Dragon" sequel sure sounds like good idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But for some reason Technos rework the control scheme making it very unintuitive and hard to use. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was a shame because we would have liked to have seen a good sequel "Double Dragon". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess you can use to control and it's not that bad. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Fighting Soccer ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now SNK (a company that produced so many great games, the 1990s) were still really not doing very much. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A typical game was fighting Soccer. (The Soccer Game which looks just like all the other Soccer Games). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and even those that thing where the ball gets really big as it flies through the air and moves towards the camera. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Ninja Gaiden // Shadow Warriors ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On a more positive note, Tecmo enters the beam up filled with "Ninja Gaiden" the Arcade Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 ninja in the U.S.A.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The title screen says it all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For those of you who [only] know the N.E.S. game, the original Arcade "Ninja Gaiden" was very different. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was real beat mapy as opposed to Being platforming. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Didn't have lots of destructible interactable objects in the background. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It also had the greatest ever continuous screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is really cool. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Bloody Wolf ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And lastly, data he produced a few notable games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They were heavily into military themed games, we get stuff like bloody war, which is like "Commando" with a three quarters isometric viewpoint. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 was also very similar to the east earlier Heavy Barrel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 about killing guys and rescuing hostages. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's also known for having some [pretty] bad English dialogue. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Bad Dudes vs. Dragoninja ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, we cannot forget this one. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "rampant ninja related crimes" and "President Ronnie has been kidnapped by ninjas". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, it's bad dudes versus the "Dragon Ninja". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whatever Kimble. That title is a genius. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's not a bad little (better than Irem Aesidual auntie). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 ... 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was that car some cool stuff but level on top of interest. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# ▸Cobra Command ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And finally, here's the game I should have mentioned last episode of "Cobra Command". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not the was an Arcade Game, not the N.E.S. core command, but a standard Horizontal Shoot-'em-Up that takes place in a helicopter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe this came out either around the same time or slightly after the console correct man. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So did eat lovers I guess installed if not exactly exciting video games here. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Conclusion ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that wraps it up. In a nutshell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 please keep your eyes peeled for the upcoming 1988 computer Round-Up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And now let's return to the demagogue. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kaijuu Monogatari: Shell Saurs Story 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Birthday 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's time for some Namco with kaiju Monogatari (which means roughly "shell creatures story"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The box heart says shell soars story. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (sorrows, like dinosaurs, I guess? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows?). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The guy on the left looks disturbingly naked in my opinion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 published by Namco and but built by birthday, an obscure little Japanese company that I really know nothing about. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, on the left as the tech speed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 you want us to fast Trust me. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're gonna link the introductory sequence. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But let's actually take a look at King Mike's translation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A wonder though kaiju Monogatari is one of those games that makes no sense even in English. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Blot seems [pretty] much in the Square and "Final Fantasy"-style, the harmony of the world has been disturbed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and shell creatures have elemental properties Earth wind, fire and water. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bad guy is unfortunately called fat badger. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not very scary sounding. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 His opening does have a cool effect where fat badgers appears and disappears for a split second. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 hoping to watch This on the 60 frames per second version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the rose battle fat badger and get scattered to the ends of the earth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to get them back together and defeat the Badger. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The King tells you there's rumors of other shell creatures and other parts of the world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How fast tumors travel around this place? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He saw the show pitchers fighting Pat badger just a minute ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe your heroes have been dicking around for a few months after fighting that badger? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So kaiju Monogatari is very much in the 'Dragon Quest' mode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, this is the first R.P.G. from Namco that's clearly inspired by "Dragon Quest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Almost everything in this game is derived directly from annexes R.P.G. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 shops in town so various items which will become important later. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The sokkia don't bother buying any right now. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the pharmacy sells a canteen, which you might want to grab. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not sure why. pharmacy will be selling a canteen, but there you go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then we have some treasure chests which are tantalizingly out of reach. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you start talking to people, you'll find this guy who wants some water (like maybe water in a canteen). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Give them the canteen, and he'll move allowing you to get the chests. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But go for the chest and hey into locked. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Certain chests and doors require keys, which naturally disappear out of your inventory when you use them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know who invented the disposable key in R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But whoever it was, I hate that guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also very important is the poison poppy as we'll see later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So first things first go out and get some experience in Gold (or pearls as they call them this game). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Combat is initially in my opinion, very unbalanced. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike 'Dragon Quest' slimes, the bats and slugs (which often combined groups have to) have just way too many Hit Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the battles are just a war of attrition. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It is to where the enemy down and they wear you down. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because you [only] have 14 Hit Points, there's about a 50/50 chance you'll die. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You survived we'll have about one or two points left, so we have to hightail it back to the end and spend five pearls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So routine Level 2 is [pretty] painful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's quite easy to get your bucket even right outside the first castle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can try to escape but this works maybe 50% of the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 naturally, by better weapons and armor, which takes quite a while. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But once you get to level three or four, you'll be able to venture out a bit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The wolf is, sort of, spread out with little in the way of landmarks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 makes it kind of hard to navigate. Actually. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 you will encounter little caves and such, which almost always require a silver key. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's right, the disposable silver keys (either that our campaign or the Soccer). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we head back to the castle to buy the item and then head back out To the cable, whatever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you've got to talk to a guy who gives you a map or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here is kaiju Monogatari is one original idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In most R.P.G.s, which is '"Dragon Quest II", you will encounter other party members and they join your party. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here. However, if you open up your menus here, there is an option there called pass. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 heading that will switch you to the next party member who is talking to a different King, who also gives you 50, pearls and a heart stone, and you're also at Level 1. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Normally, the first part in R.P.G. is the rough is going we're had to fight basic enemies over and over, he will a lot and then slowly and painfully become powerful enough to survive in the overworld for more than a minute. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the real game begins. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 kaiju Monogatari hover makes you do this four times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, you've got to separately Level Up each party member from scratch and then find the other members. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And each character starts in their own separate town which are [pretty] much identical to all the other towns in the world. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's, sort of, like 'Dragon Quest' for [only] really laying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game takes the most grueling, repetitive part of an old-school R.P.G. and makes you repeat it four times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great job guys! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's very little variety of each character has different stats and uses some magic, but really, it's not a big difference. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Generally speaking, your first goal is to train on the hearts don't you start out with for a map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and the maps are really not very useful at this point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 you'll encounter various villages towns. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 it's [pretty] nonlinear, though you are limited by your strength or your wealth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, no way would you have enough money to make the boat ride this early in the game? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you probably never heard of this game until today, but it actually did spawn a series (though later games were published by Hudson). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 sequels appeared on the Game Boy and Super FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of them was die kaiju Monogatari (scene here). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 was never the most high-tech or well-known art. Big series, but someone must have been buying them because they kept making the games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, eventually you will encounter these passages of arbeid goblins, which lends The game has various areas together. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is where the sokhi is needed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Strangely, if you have a random enemy encounter in this passage, you'll get these weird sequences on Chessboard like floor where you fight multiple battles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you can finally reach the area where another character is, and if you get them together, they can join forces. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, it gives you a special match the bell called magma. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These Magic Points from both characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 know that both characters are poisoned. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One completely hateful thing about this game is the way you frequently get poisoned. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The poison poppy is used to cure poison, but your inventory is extremely limited. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have like five inventory slots first. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's like "Final Fantasy" where you can walk around with 10 poison gears. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 more like one or two maximum. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 and then it gets worse. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 because Getting poisoned causes you to constantly lose health, but also it lowers your strength (making battles damn near impossible). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your main hero who has no healing magic is [pretty] much screwed if he gets poison and doesn't have the poison Poppy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, poisoning really sucks in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what we have here is a game with a very interesting and fresh approach to multiple characters, but the characters have no personality or backstory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The combat is too repetitive and doesn't make much sense. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Could be could be had some magic attacks, but they always can do the exact same damage as physical attacks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what's the point of magic then? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there aren't any fancy elemental properties like "Final Fantasy". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Casting is on fire monster does the same damage is being done with with your own sword. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even the special magma spell is kind of lame. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's a cool idea but ends up being a completely unpolished game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gyruss 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 18 🇯🇵 // 1989 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 // Ultra 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another F.D.S. game from Konami gyrus, or maybe guy virus, or maybe it's named after the Greek sandwich and is Eros. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Japanese version has this long crazy tech scroll, which probably tells the story of an alien invasion how the fate of the world is resting on one pilot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ooh, I bet that's him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., Konami released it on a cartridge or the ultra games label. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a much shorter plot description. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and the music (js Bach's "toccata and fugue in D minor"), sounds a little different. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, by the way, despite being the most familiar piece of music with box name on it, a lot of musicals colors, don't think that Bach actually wrote it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That probably red screen is all something new to the U.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep, you go to Neptune first than Pluto, which sounds wrong but every so often Pluto is closer to the sun the Neptune Pluto Pluto's weird orbit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As we see here, drivers is what we would call it to Shooter, similar to the classic game Tempest. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is you move in a circle shooting enemies that are moving up and down interior surface of an imaginary tube shape. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now generous is a [pretty] old game to be getting a port in 1988, since it was released to arcades in 1983, which was several generations ago in 1980s Arcade Game terms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 a cool-looking game due to the enemy ships movement patterns. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 but it suffered from having a joystick rather than a dial controller like Tempest. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, drivers had already been released to many platforms by 1984, such as the 2600 Click division and the Commodore 64. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this is an odd choice for Konami to be suddenly revisiting in 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But hell, they really an updated version for the Xbox Live Arcade appears ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 so why not? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess they liked the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, you shoot enemies as they fly around, Dodge any projectiles that come at you, occasionally get a boring power-up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After a couple levels you'll get a boss battle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 do have a limited use charged up shot that is fired with the A button. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These come in handy for some bosses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As mentioned, the Arcade drivers did not use a rotary controller. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And obviously this version uses the D-Pad. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there are two controller settings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The one I'm using here moves you towards the 12 o'clock position when you get up on the D-Pad and the three o'clock position when right and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The other control option is more rotary like. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 hitting left or right moves you clockwise or counterclockwise. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the other control schemes, you don't stop when reach 12 or three or nine or six he just keep living around that around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you can't get stuck at one of these points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's [pretty] much the way it is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 versus a simple game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One notable thing is that the original was designed by Yoshiki Okamoto, who left Konami for Capcom and design such games as "1942", "Gun.Smoke", forgotten worlds, and was later involved in "Resident Evil". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 he's still active perhaps the most well-known recent him his his folklore. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is, I believe, the last F.D.S. game from Konami. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pachinko GP 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 More F.D.S. games here, this time from the frequently disappointing Data East. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and don't get your hopes up. Now because this is a Pachinko game. (I can go Grand Prix or Pachinko GP). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 days can't decide what to call this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, it's worth pointing out that the expectations of quality for FamiCom games has reached the point where even something like this has [pretty] decent art on the title screen and a decent tune. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 slips a Grand Prix game in the sense that you're racing from city to city, but doing so by playing Pachinko as opposed to driving cars. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Right, she's not wearing bunny ears. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you will recall, the pinko game is one where you put ball bearings into machine in hopes of winning more ball bearings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is totally not a form of gambling, but in reality it is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Pachinko games often let you examine the pig configuration up close. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't really know what for. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this helps you plan your Pachinko strategy, but I really have no idea how. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you start you'll use the D-Pad to increase or decrease the pressure of the ball bearing Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Getting right increase the pressure, decrease. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 the ball bearings come out with the little wheels and do the keys and then win more balls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start with 100 wouldn't try to end up with 1000 before the timer runs out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally we'll hit something and the whole business will start flashing when more bearings. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you beat the clock, you'll move on to the next machine and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one has a slot machine like mechanism built in (something which is apparently quite popular and modern Pachinko game). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is like a cool thing since particular games strike me as but the combination of luck and inaction. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most of the time you don't really have to do anything. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just watch ball bearings pile up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If that's not happening, then just the pressure a little bit told. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe there's really some kind of arcane, skilled Pachinko, but to me, this is really, sort of, like watching the video game play itself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 but no, sort of, reward. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Deja Vu 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 22 🇯🇵 // 1990 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ICOM Simulations 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And now for a completely different type of Adventure Game, in support of icons deja vu with a nifty new musical theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This console version was released in both Japan and the U.S. by chemical. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if they were the guys who actually ported this to the FamiCom I have no idea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is perhaps the [only] in N.E.S. game to begin in a bathroom stall. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Deja Vu is an American point click Adventure Game (one of the original point click Adventure Games). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we can, sort of, compare this to something like "Samurai Sword", and we'll get an idea of how us Japanese Adventure Games tend to differ. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's quite a bit of narration in deja vu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Space Quest", the narrator uses, Sort of, a detached kind of ironic tone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, when you examine the toilet paper. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 most of the narration is taken directly from the original Computer Game, released on the Macintosh in 1985. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've already seen that version a couple times in 'Chrontendo' before. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's take a look at the Amiga version, which is quite similar to the Mac version, though it's in full color. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the huge innovation in deja vu was using the mouse and using a windowed setup that [pretty] much resembled the max and amigas operating systems. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The result was quite a bit of ease when it comes to playing it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To examine something you simply click on it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To walk through a door, click either on the doorway, or the corresponding box in the mini map on the right-hand side of the screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You could use the verb list to interact with items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also the game had a really great writing and some creepy death scenes, but very little music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the home version, use it was added to the entire game, which was nice, but the interface had to be completely reworked, which turned out to be not so nice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You still have the verb list, but the inventory window has been replaced with a notebook listing all the items you have, and you can no longer drag and drop items over the inventory. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Deja Vu is mostly an inventory base game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game world itself is [pretty] small and there's not too much interaction with other people. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And most of the game is spent finding items in the Newseum and they expect ways. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, you'll always be finding keys used to unlock doors. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this is no Sierra game, but there are still a few ways to lose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 choosing the wrong option when you encounter an elevator will kill you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which is really not that surprising when you think about it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though the creepy skulls from the Computer version have been replaced with a tombstone. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But unlike the Computer versions, dying will just take you back to the continue option which will put your screen or two before where you got killed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So really dying is no big deal. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, it's fun to mess around whenever a dangerous situation arises. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other ways to lose or getting shot by muggers, or randomly shooting people on the street. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 that will get you instantly arrested. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 or walking into the police station before you've solved the game's mysteries. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Surprisingly, the death by suicide option is carried over from the Computer Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you use the gun on herself, you will shoot yourself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The narrator will then give you a sarcastic congratulations. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also found in deja vu is a minigame of sorts - the slot machine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, since you start out with a limited number of coins, this is the best way to get some extra cash (which you need for the cap rides). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The problem is the slot machines are slow and boring. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can't actually move all your money However, since an extra coin will always appear if you run out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 basically using the coin On the slot machine over and over again gets old [pretty] quick. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, your character is named a starting detective who starts off with no memory as to who he is and wakes up in the bathroom of an empty bar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll find clues to your identity as the game goes on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Exploring areas around the bar you'll find a dead body. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And slowly a plot involving the kidnapping and murder begins emerging. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The writing is quite good and emulates that classic hardwell detective fiction. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This man is missing something, namely life. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know how well this all worked in the Japanese version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 According to mag weasels, Kevin Gifford, the FamiCom version of "Shadowgate" (another icons match Adventure Games) is considered to be kusoge in Japan for its over the top writing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Beyond the writing, the gameplay itself is decent, but there really aren't many puzzles in deja vu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, For example, you merely need to read the notes on various kinds of metal sends you find, then put the credit card into a capsule and then use it on yourself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will restore your memory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it mostly involves opening every drawer you encounter and then taking every item, such as notes that will fill them with the plot, and also give you addresses of new locations to travel to using the taxi cabs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I'd say the main difference between this and the many Japanese Adventure Games is how open ended it is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 you can move around anywhere you want in the game world that isn't blocked by a locked door. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can pick up items anywhere, even you don't have any idea what they're for. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the elf King and "Samurai Sword", Things don't totally appear out of nowhere after performing a certain action or talking to a certain character. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is going to be some backtracking involved. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 in the game is somewhat nonlinear, like "Samurai Sword", which has more of a 'perform an action and then move forward' structure to it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I like the fact that you find the unconscious kidnapping In the trunk, but just leave her there tied up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, you have to give her a to serum or she's unconscious and then she'll give out some information. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In order to win deja vu, you must find all the important pieces of evidence, including things that will incriminate the actual perpetrators. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you must also get rid of any evidence that points towards you (clutched the gun that was planted on you). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is never quite spelled out for you, but you need to dispose of all them in the sewer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise the cops will find the evidence and arrest you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the game is stupidly finicky in some areas, namely here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'd already collected everything I needed and gotten rid of everything else. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But when I went to the police station, I was arrested because I didn't have enough evidence to prove the real killer was. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 the missing piece of evidence turned out to be a letter I had my possession, but I hadn't taken it out of the envelope that it came in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see deja vu shabu uses nested inventories. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I have the envelope in my inventory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you need to open the envelope and take the letter to move it from the envelope sub inventory to the main inventory. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, I went to the cops they took everything my possession, including an envelope, but were unable to find the important letter inside the envelope, which is just plain stupid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But once I move the letter and went to the police, I then beat the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The End narration is [pretty] odd. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It indicates the police have all the evidence of a real killer, but you were still tried for the murder. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And your lawyer uses the evidence in court to get the real criminals to confess on the witness stand. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If the evidence against him was that solid, why did the Illinois da put you on trial instead of the other guys? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems like a waste of taxpayer money. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, they'd rather lose a solid game, but one that is seriously hampered by the N.E.S. controller. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the selling points of the original Computer version was the easy-to-use mouse based interface. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To move out a door just click on the door. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No typing required. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Chemicals version requires four times as many steps to perform that same action. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Click on the word open, then click on the door, and click on the word move, and then click on the door again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To move that letter, for example, you hit open, click on the arrow to flip the pages of your notebook, click on the entry for the envelope, Then click take, and then click on letter again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And using the D-Pad to navigate the menus is not fun. Since your verbs are on one corner of the screen, that has another corner, and the button of the pages and get another corner. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You're constantly moving your pointer all over the place. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, I can't wait concert dayjob would be a great game through the rather mangled control scheme. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, this game (as well as "Uninvited", "Shadowgate", "Maniac Mansion") helped introduce console gamers to Adventure Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it definitely has its place in-game history. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Moero!! Junior Basket Two on Two 🇯🇵 // Hoops 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 22 🇯🇵 // 1989 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Aicom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh Lord No! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This title screen get any more hideous looking. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Every single thing of video game title screen can do wrong. This one does. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not a very promising start. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is bowlero Jr basket to on to, the latest Angelica is Moreau Sports Game series, (millennial 'Pro Yakou'. four "Bases Loaded" being the most well-known game in that series). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, Jaleco is packing these things in these weird boxes at a window so you can see the cartridge inside. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really sure why. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe just, sort of, make them stand out on the shelf? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is apparently good enough for us release under the name "hoops" with a much funkier cover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As the name "hoops", sort of, implies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is not a pro Basketball Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually based on casual schoolyard basketball. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 can choose among several players with 70 style mix. names. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 you can choose one or 2-Player with either one-on-one or two on two. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are also a couple options in regard to the rules. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it's whether the winner or loser gets the next ball. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each player has its own strengths and weaknesses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some are fast, some are slow, some are good defense, some good at shooting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This option is taught by shooting baskets to see who gets to control the ball. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's, sort of, a little timing minigame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and didn't shoot right as the arrow is above the hoop. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game itself couldn't be simpler. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In one-on-one mode, there's [only] one button. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 it shoots the ball. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 to on to load the second button passes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 the object? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 try to steal the ball from your opponent, make a shot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 reps, the best way to get a basket is to from right up close to the basket. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that way we'll get a cool little cutscene which, sort of, rip straight off from "Double Dribble". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even if you miss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can't quite tell why you sometimes get a basket and sometimes you fail. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think there are sweet spots. On the floor you need to be standing on order actually get one in the hoop. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another issue is that the C.P.U. can still evolve really easily at tends to run out in front of you giving you a charging fell. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 the two on two modes a bit more involved and as mentioned has passing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 one thing does bear mentioning. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 has a couple of female players mixed in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also an option for a shooting [only] competition. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 so "hoops" isn't really a bad game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it's cool to see a half court Basketball Game, but it won't make you forget "Double Dribble" or "NBA Jam" anytime soon. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Takeshi no Sengoku Fuuunji 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 November 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our last game and another game in the 'Why the hell does this even exists?' category is to Kashi noson. Goku Fuji (something Like "the Kashi Son Goku Soldier of Fortune"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 and this is the third game based around Japanese T.V. personality Takeshi Kitano. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 the other two being, of course, "to Kashi no chosen Jo" which is Taito. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that 'Family Trainer' game based on the 'catchy is a castle' T.V. show, which was released by Bandai. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This however, is a Board Game style video game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 two, three or four people can play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start by entering in a name, selecting a character to represent you, And then Off you go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game seems to have this Goku era theme to it, which I guess would have plays into 'caches castle' in which the cashier was dressed up in historical costume. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 player takes turns rolling dice and moving around the board racking up Gold. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game doesn't seem too complicated. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some squares will give you bonus minigames, or the frog, for example, will make you lose a turn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still not really knowing the rules. It's [pretty] different. Understand how to win. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And as I mentioned, various minigames pop up on certain squares, such as the Golf Game, though you just get one shot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also encounter various individuals from time to time, including this weird looking guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, what would this, sort of, thing be without a bunny girl? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a little gambling minigame in which you try to guess dice rolls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you might recall, there were two options on title screen sim Goku and party. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 to go visit we're playing and parties allowed to do [only] the minigames. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 will actually encounter one last to get economy in the game in a couple episodes, which means that the FamiCom actually had more Takeshi-related games in the head "Final Fantasy", "Castlevania", or "Super Mario Bros." games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, good job FamiCom! 🍇🍌
