👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 28 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh man! Finally! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Chrontendo Episode 28" is here - one of the most delayed episodes of 'Chrontendo' ever! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But that's cool; it's all in the past, now. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This episode is really long - covering three big important games, as well as some utter crap. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I won't blather any further. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We pick up at the very end of January 1988. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Gun.Smoke 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 January 27 🇯🇵 // 1988 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As we approach the end of January 1988, we have the first Capcom game of the New Year, "Gun.Smoke" for the F.D.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note that's 'Gun . Smoke' - to avoid confusion with a long-running Western T.V. show, I assume. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Capcom reached a... bit into their back catalogue, for this one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade game came out in 1985! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (This is the Arcade version, here.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you think the game looks sorta like "Commando", well, then you're right! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Gun.Smoke" is, sort of, a follow-up to "Commando", with a wild west setting replacing the jungle warfare. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It landed in Arcades about six months after "Commando" and wasn't really as successful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, in the U.S., the game was released in cartridge almost immediately - in February. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Back then, Capcom was the exception to the rule about there being, like, a really big delay between the Japanese and the U.S. releases of games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, they have made a few changes, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, if you take a look at the Wanted poster, you'll see a bit more detail was put into, uh, each character's face. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they've added some more music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really, the U.S. version is better due to the cartridge having more space than the F.D.S. discs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like I was saying, "Gun.Smoke" is a wild west version of "Commando", but there are a few things added in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shooting barrels will reveal money and power-ups. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, that's right, money! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's funny how stealing from the dead is considered a loathesome trait in real life, yet is perfectly acceptable from a heroic figure in video games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And "Gun.Smoke" has some cool stuff! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Among the items you find in the barrel are, uh, a horse! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I know; how did the horse get in a barrel? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, just like the tanks in "Ikari Warriors", the horse gives you a bit of an offensive advantage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also take a few hits before disappearing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also buy Special Weapons, such as the shotgun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These weapons have finite ammo, but once you obtain a weapon, enemies will start dropping ammo refills. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the end of each level is a boss battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I just took care of the first boss, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Special Weapons are [pretty] helpful, when it comes to fighting these guys; so they can be a bit tough. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, you can buy weapons from the shopkeepers, who are just standing around hawking their wares, despite the fact the bullets are flying around everywhere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The 'Mag Num' is the most powerful gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's kind of an odd tradition, often found in videogame Shooters (like "Half-Life"), the Revolver is deadlier than a Machine Gun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One irritation in "Gun.Smoke": um... You have to actually find the wanted poster; you may have seen you grab it, just a moment ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the Wanted poster is actually invisible, until ya shoot at it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, um, when you think about that, that's a [pretty] bizarre idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, isn't the point of having a Wanted poster so everyone can see it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why would you have an invisible Wanted poster? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to collect it before you can actually fight the boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Without the poster, the level would just loop around infinitely! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you really can't find it, you can actually just buy it from a shop. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, while "Gun.Smoke" is not as well-known as the home version of "Commando", I'd say this port actually fares a little better, in one regard: you can move in fire in different directions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The control scheme takes some getting used to. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One button fires left, the other fires right, and pressing both at once will fire straight ahead. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the simple fact that you can shoot enemies, without having to walk towards them, makes the combat a bit smoother. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All in all, I'd say it's a fine little game, though unfortunately, Capcom was not too prolific in the first half of 1988, so it will be a bit before their next game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Donald Land 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 January 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's another one from Data East. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After "Karnov", I had high hopes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But "Donald Land", as we see here, is a licensed title and has the distinction of being the first FamiCom game, based around characters from advertisements. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later, of course, we'd get games based on The Noid and Cool Ppot, but "Donald Land" holds a special place in Nintendo history. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we see a bunch of characters here who don't really seem to figure in the game much at first, but in later levels you'll often encounter them being held captive by a boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Hamburglar turns up as the second-to-last boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The final boss is this guy, a creepy looking wizard clown with razor-sharp teeth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Mayor McCheese sends Ronald off to take care of this evil clown. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really, shouldn't the Hamburger Cop be taking care of this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This seems like a... job for law-enforcement personnel, rather than a children's entertainer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, Ronald does behave surprisingly violently in this game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyone who gets in his way, he takes out with bombs! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And not just regular bombs, but sticky bombs, like they have in "Halo"! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we can't really blame him, because Donald Land is clearly a violent place, with maniacs walking around, throwing TNT and exploding purple Jack [of] Lanterns. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is a side of McDonaldland we never really saw on those T.V. commercials. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Playing the game, you, sort of, have to wonder who it's aimed at. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole McDonald theme make it seem like a kiddie game, but it can be a bit, uh, tough at spots - and not always in a good way! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bombs will sometimes pass right through enemies and when ya throw 'em they g... -- move in such a high arc, it's kinda difficult to get 'em to land precisely. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, there's also a little, uh, section between levels where you can, like, use your -- your money (or your hamburgers, technically) to, uh, to buy stuff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are moves that require really precise timing (timing I don't really have) like reaching high areas by throwing a bomb, then jumping, landing on the bomb, and then jumping again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was trying to do that a moment ago, but wasn't being very successful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Donald Land" is a surprisingly pleasant-looking game with crisp graphics and nice looking colors, though Ronald's smock is red instead of yellow, for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is a bit of a weird vibe here, like those trees that do that creepy smile when ya jump on 'em. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the kid in the little yellow jacket crying huge deadly tears. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is a creative touch! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How do you cross the lake? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By jumping on the splashes of water, caused by that ship firing cannonballs at ya. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And why is this game called 'Donald Land' instead of 'McDonald Land'? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No idea. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wikipedia unhelpfully points out that Ronald McDonald is called Donald McDonald in Japan, but this doesn't explain the missing 'Mc'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Donald Land" is hardly a classic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Compared to "Karnov" it's quite disappointing! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... But compared to, say, the 'Transformers' games, it's [pretty] darn good (worth checking out, at least)! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jumbo Ozaki Hole in One Professional 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 01 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL Laboratory 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Great! Another Golf Game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom needs more Golf Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Jumbo Ozaki Hole in One Professional". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 'So who or what is Jumbo Ozaki?', you might ask. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Only] Japan's most successful Golf player ever (real name Masashi Ozaki). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's called 'Jumbo' because he's about six feet tall - [pretty] tall for a Japanese guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 He's had a very successful career, so naturally he got his own Golf Game - [the] first Golf Game we've seen for the FamiCom to carry the name of an actual golfer on it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember that HAL has made several Golf Games for Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, why not put out their own Golf Game? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The options are [pretty] typical. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can have 2-Player competitive tournament and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You got the overhead view of the course; you can get a close up of the putting green if you want. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Use the D-Pad to choose your club and the angle of your shot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, here's the difference. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 HAL decided to increase the difficulty by changing the way you control your swing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You still do the same, you know, 'press the button swing the club, then press it again at the right moment to strike the ball'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you need to turn your button presses by looking at the golfer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are no visual cues on that little semicircular swing indicator, until after you've actually completed your swing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As a result, it can be, uh, very easy to slice or hook the ball by getting the timing off. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, don't be fooled by that part, right there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Putting is actually very difficult; that was pure luck. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually, uh, quite possible to miss the ball entirely. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whereas the Nintendo 'Golf' Games are [pretty] intuitive and obvious about the timing of the swing, "...Hole in One..." requires a bit of practice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When it comes to putting, however, there's really not enough time to try to accurately gauge the power of the swing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you, sort of, have to, sort of, tap the button twice real quick and hope you don't way overshoot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the one cool thing is there's the overhead tracking shots of the course as you move from one hole to the next. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The layout of the hole seems [pretty] typical for Golf Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Jumbo Ozaki..." Golf is, uh, a [pretty] much a no-frills Golf Game, with a twist on the swing mechanic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, Jumbo makes no appearances in the game, as far as I can tell. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It appears that they simply got the rights to stick his name on the box art and figured that would be good enough! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Paris Dakar Rally Special 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 01 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by ISCO 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by CBS/Sony Inc. TSO 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, from CBS and ISCO (the same guys who gave us "Seikima II"), its "Paris Dakar Rally Special". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, every episode of 'Chrontendo' meeds one utterly ridiculous kusoge game and this is it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We just saw a Racing Game based on the Paris Dakar Rally, "Victory Run" in "Chronturbo Episode 1". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was a nice-looking gritty Driving Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game is nothing like "Victory Run". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you unsuspectingly fire up the game and 'Hmm!' you don't see any racing or cars. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, 'Haha, of course, not! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That would make too much sense! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't even have a car yet!'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The First step in a Racing Game is to find a car, right? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the game sorts of this odd little mini Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You go around talking to folks trying to find a sponsor and money to buy a car. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is mostly done by entering to building and talking to people about each of the topics in the menu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually you'll get a sponsor, find some money, and then you can buy a car. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They need to enroll in the rally. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then they make you do this, sort of, weird little reflex game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is to prove you're a good driver or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hmm! I think ISCO just, sort of, invented the quicktime event, so take that, Sega! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So good for you; you celebrate by doing a little dance on top of an enormous brick wall. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you jet off to Paris and the race begins! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, at this point, you think, 'Okay, that wasn't too bad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But next, I'll be racing from Paris to Dakar. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will be, sort of, like a low-tech "Victory Run", right?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you're very wrong! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game is not anything like you think it's gonna be. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The race starts and it seems really lame! (not exciting at all). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it gets better. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For, uh, some reason most [of] the cars go really slowly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This seems almost more like driving in traffic than racing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But also super fast cars come flying out to the bottom of the screen, trying to smash into you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have about one quarter of a second to get out of the way if you see one appear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And probably the [only] way you're... [only] ever going to die in this level is by those cars constantly doing suicide strikes on you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So finally, you will eventually reach the end of stage one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The staff will read with Nazi salutes, and then there's a Bonus Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here's your route. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Probably the least accurate map in a video game ever.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, uh, here's Stage 2, but this is a crazy little Maze Game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the goal here is to avoid all the other cars. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And -- But you're, sort of, hampered by the fact that it's very easy to get the car stuck on a corner. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This handles like the Atari 2600 "Pac-Man". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, honestly, I wanted to quit here, but I kept going. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... So what's next? Another racing segment or something else? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is where it gets quite odd. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You're now shooting giant yellow mice and dodging helicopters! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I almost, uh, admire ISCO for saying Racing Game? 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 Paris Dakar Rally? 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 How boring! 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let's put some shooting sequences in here! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Giant birds throwing eggs at you? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, what's this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, the game has now become completely unmoored from the original concept of driving a real world race. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It doesn't look too bad, uh, but, just like "Seikima II" the -- the jumping controls are very awkward. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, actually I gave up at this level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But later you will get like an underwater level and even then, like, a top-down shooting level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can just imagine someone buying this, thinking it'd be, like, uh, something like "Rad Racer", and then being completely baffled. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... So congratulations, guys. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You win the 'Chrontendo', 'What the Hell?' award, this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Fire Bam 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 01 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory | Live Planning 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL Laboratory 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've actually got a few FamiCom Disk System games, today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The format hasn't quite died out yet. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Released the same day as "Jumbo Ozaki Hole in One..." is this little gem from HAL, "Fire Bam". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're also ROMs out there titled "Fire Bomb". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The title screen gives credit to Live Planning, which was some sort of development company attached to HAL. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The name was also on the weird "Air Fortress" game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Presumably games based on water and earth will be next. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Fire Bam" is a side-scrolling Hack-'n'-Slash, like we've seen many times before. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Here we go, action and adventure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 ...or maybe not. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so we need to go into that portal, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now we finally get to pay some enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's also a Shop to duck into as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though whenever you go into a Shop early in the game, they're always out of everything. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And advance slowly, or enemies will tend to land right on you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Holy cow! What is that thing? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By the way, "Fire Bam" is full of *long* loading screens and requirements to flip the disk. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 About 50% of the unedited video was simply loading screens of some sort, and I [pretty] much edited all of those out for you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, after going into, uh, that portal there, you enter this weird annoying forced-scrolling sequence. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not a big fan of this, sort of, thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are a lot of these in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You probably spend more time on these screens than in the regular overworld. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whenever you kill monsters, ya get fire, which is, like, the game's money, but here the fires tend to, like, fly off the edge of the screen before you can grab 'em. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After about a minute, you're suddenly teleported to a boss level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First couple bosses seem *absurdly* easy; just spam them with your arms swinging attack, then you get a lot of cash (or flames, technically). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you return to the overworld, you're treated to this rather inexplicable split-screen segment. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] not really sure what it's trying to convey. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Finally! A shop that's not sold out! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Time to buy a better weapon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so what's to like about "Fire Bam"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, maybe the oddball creature design. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The music is okay in parts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the cover art is quite weird; sort of, like, an actual three-dimensional puppet thing was created. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But what's not to like? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess just about everything else. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The hideous color design, for example, uh, the unwieldy controls... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (In order to execute a high jumper, you press down on the D-Pad and the jump button). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why not press up and jump that makes more sense. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Trying to execute or running high job over a boss or something while holding Down is just, sort of, clumsy and unintuitive. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Check out those giant giraffe creatures. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those things will actually kill you in one hit, for some reason. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I don't really know the story behind Live Planning, but I didn't really care that much for "Air Fortress" and we don't really like this game either. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Air Fortress" had all those rather boring Shoot-'em-Up sequences. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And "Fire Bam" has this rather unpleasant forced-scrolling sections that tend to go on and on for *way* too long. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, another extremely easy boss here (like, two hits and he's gone). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Both games have their moments, but they're certainly not at all consistent. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, yeah. And suddenly the third boss is, like, way, way harder! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can swing at him all you want and he doesn't die. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm gonna have to say that, uh, "Fire Bam" is one of HAL's lesser games and not even as well-made as something like "Chesterfield..." - quite a bit of a disappointment. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kamen Rider Club 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 03 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our first Bandai game this episode is "Kamen Rider Club". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoa-hoa! What an exciting intro! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Explosions, motorcycles, giant bugs riding motorcycles! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, these are not technically bugs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are just guys wearing bug helmets. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Kamen Rider' was a Japanese T.V. series, or rather a whole bunch of T.V. series beginning in 1971 and continuing on today (as far as I know). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are what you would call Tokusatsu shows (that is, special effects shows). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They mostly revolve around superheroes and guys in monster suits. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, "Kamen Rider Club" (developed by Tose, naturally) is a weird little game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Half side-scrolling Platformer and half R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not a combination that really works, in this case - maybe in a better game, it might be okay. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, as you may have noticed, the mechanics in this game are a little odd. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can [only] punch straight down - and doing so while jumping causes you to, sort of, hover in midair as long as you keep punching, so you will need to jump every time you want to attack an enemy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For a game that relies so much on jumping, the jumping controls are... a little strange. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once ya jump, you can't control your character in any fashion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in order to jump any way other than straight up, you'll need to start running, prior to hitting the jump button. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The jumps are often set so that you will land on the side of a platform and then you'll have to frantically hit the button, in order to climb up to the top. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One little goofy quirk in this game is that hitting your head on a platform will temporarily flatten your head, preventing you from climbing on any platforms. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, if ya touch an enemy without punching him [from] above, you'll need to battle him in these R.P.G.-type sequences. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You do so by running into each enemy and forcing them back to the wall. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is done by hitting the button over and over again frantically. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 (I guess these guys aren't so bad if they go to Heaven when they die.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, uh, what do you get in this game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's lots of frustrating jumps, getting stuck quite a lot, accidentally running into enemies, having to do these stupid battles over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again (I really need to stress) the jumping in this game is not cool! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This kind of thing tends to happen over and over again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Every once in a while, I find something cool, like a motorcycle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But look what happens when you try to use it! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoop! It's gone! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While this game doesn't look that bad on paper, actually trying to play it... (well) you'll find yourself getting probably [pretty] pissed-off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I'd say this is definitely one to avoid. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Guardic Gaiden 🇯🇵 // The Guardian Legend 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "3030" ♪ by Deltron 3030

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 05 🇯🇵 // 1989 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Compile 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Irem 🇯🇵 // Brøderbund 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are a few obscure games this episode but [only] one that can properly be described as a cult classic, "Guardic Gaiden" (or "...Guardian Legend" in the U.S.) is another product from the good folks at Compile, published by Irem. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. version was picked up by Brøderbund. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A rather cool music theme sets the mood for a tale of cosmic destruction. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 What's the plot here? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, a mysterious planet is headed towards Earth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in such cases, it's best to shoot first and ask questions later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you say, 'Is "...Guardian Legend" a Shooter? Well, how appropriate since Compile is known for its excellent Shoot-'em-Ups!'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But there's more to the game than that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...Guardian Legend" is very unusual in that it's a hybrid which grafts some vertical Shooting Action onto a "...Zelda" clone. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is definitely not the first hybrid Shooter we've seen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Remember "Galg", the scroll R.P.G.?). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, as the name indicates, this is a sequel to "Guardic" - a 1987 M.S.X. game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Guardic" is, sort of, an unusual game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a non-scrolling Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You fight one screen full of enemies at a time; and then, on each screen, you allocate a certain number of points to Speed, Weapons, and Special Abilities. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the points are extremely limited, uh, and the game is actually extremely difficult. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "[Guardic] Gaiden", by comparison, is quite sophisticated. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game opens up with a standard vertical Shoot-'em-Up level, followed by a huge classic Compile boss, with lots of gunports. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you actually reach the alien world (which is called Naju) ya come across a message from one of the previous inhabitants, who attempted to initiate a self-destruct sequence to blow up Naju. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The fact that someone is reading the message indicates that he failed in his task. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The instructions are given to you for destroying Naju and its dangerous alien inhabitants. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, at this point, the game switches to a top-down "...Zelda"-esque Action Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your goal is to find a series of corridors and activate the self-destruct switches in each. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, along the way you'll need to hunt down more weapons, power-ups, and the like. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each screen fills up with enemies, as ya enter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can blast 'em with your standard ray gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya have a decent sized Life Bar (and you'll need it!). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, items to refill your Life Bar are [pretty] common. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, certain screens will trap you, as soon as you enter, and a mini-Boss fight will ensue. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the first one, coming up, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This first guy's a real piece of cake. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later mini-Bosses tend to move around a lot more and shoot at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Defeating one of these guys will generally net you a useful power-up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you've defeated him, then the doors will open up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the Map Screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, I've attained a few Special Weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those are the icons at the bottom [of] the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These weapons all have limited use and will consume power chips. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, finally I've reached the first corridor, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's usually some sort of trick to open these things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the first one, ya simply to shoot it a whole bunch of times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later on, you need to perform less obvious actions to open the doors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fortunately, there's usually a room nearby with a hint. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, the character you play, the Guardian, I guess is, sort of, like, every otaku's dream; it's a sexy robot girl that can turn into a spaceship. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That sequence is actually quite cool. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each corridor is -- consists of a decent-sized Shoot-'em-Up level with a boss at the end. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the first few have an underwater theme. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, I should probably point out that "...Guardian Legend" is a tough game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These shooting sequences don't really obey modern protocols. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enemies seem to come at you from the side or behind - or, rather, if ya pass them without destroying them, they will frequently turn around and come up behind you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you've got lots of projectiles flying in all directions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike most Shooting Games, enemies don't just shoot randomly; they all shoot towards you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Virtually everything in this game hones in on you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Life Bar and frequent Health refills makes these sections possible, but it's... absolutely impossible to dodge everything this game throws at ya. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This difficultly can extend to the overworld as well, especially upon exiting the room, you may find yourself stuck behind some blocks, while five or six enemies suddenly converge upon you, instantly killing you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After, uh, completing a corridor, you'll usually get a key that will open up a new area on the map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, you can pick up Life Bar extensions, Shield power-ups, Weapons power-ups, and more Special Weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Special Weapons are often the key to surviving boss battles in this game, as the standard laser is [pretty] pathetic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are some of the early bosses, right here, such as a giant lobster. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the claws are very difficult to dodge. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This particular power-up, right here, is, uh, very helpful. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It, sort of, has, like, a little sphere that revolves around you, destroying enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a bit more powerful than the standard laser and provides a, uh, bit of protection from various projectiles as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, seriously, look at this! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, everything just heads right towards you! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's impossible to dodge anything in this game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And while a lot of Shooters nowadays throw way more bullets on the screen, the bullets on "...Guardian Legend" all move fast! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The result is, in some ways, is sometimes more frantic than a lot of modern bullet-hell-type Shooters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another thing you'll be picking up a lot are these chips. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those are the little blue and red, uh, dots, that you sometimes see hidden in the blocks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's two of them, right here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...Guardian Legend" is a game that would be said to have R.P.G. elements, nowadays. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The chips are a novel way of giving the game an R.P.G. feel, without getting too complicated. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they, sort of, compress both Experience and Money into one item. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The more chips you have, the bigger your main weapon becomes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the chips are also used to fire your Special Weapons, so they serve to increase your offensive strength. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, they're also used to buy upgrades at the Shop, so they function as currency, as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and here's an enemy that's very difficult to destroy; and just keeps following you around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everywhere you go, he heads right towards ya. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also, picking up the chips will replenish a bit of your health. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So they're just all-around useful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...Guardian Legend" is long game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are 21 corridors and the World Map is 24 screens by 24 screens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... Though quite a few of the screens are actually, you know, blank. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's still at least 400 screens, I'd say. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's quite comparable to "The Legend of Zelda". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you progress, the enemies get tougher and tougher, but hopefully you have found, uh, quite a few upgrades, by now. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Corridor 21 is really just a boss Rush level, with a few waves of weak enemies mixed in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can imagine, with 20 Shooter sections, some of the bosses are repeated in various color-swapped versions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've opened up [pretty] much the entire map, here, and I'm heading towards the final area. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of the creepiest-looking bosses, who constantly sends these streams of horns to follow you around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, you can't avoid these things! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, you can pick up quite a few Super Bombs (called enemy erasers in the game). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, at the time you reach the last level, the bosses (uh, which gave you so much trouble, at first) should be much easier to defeat, due to your increased power. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After completing the final level, Naju will self-destruct and you escape, just seconds prior to the big explosion. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You would almost think Konami made this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 More seafood-themed bosses, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can really see the usefulness of that, uh, revolving sphere thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's a palette swap of a boss we saw, just a few moments ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We can make short work with the Special Weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this kind of throws tons of, like, flying eyeballs at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If nothing else, the bosses are quite creative. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we escaped, Naju blows up, but, you know, naturally it's not over - because, a moment later, one final boss will appear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In many ways "...Guardian Legend" is the culmination of everything Compile have been doing for the last few years. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... They've been, uh, making tons of Shooters (they've...), actually since 1983. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It], sort of, combines those and "Golvellius" which is their attempt at a "...Zelda"-style game from 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... There's a lot -- lot to like about "...Guardian Legend". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a slick, well-designed game, uh, technically accomplished. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The video might make ya think there's a lot of flicker, but when you play the game, it looks very good. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As always, Compile manages to stick down tons of moving objects on the screen, without slow down. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The number of power-ups in this game is amazing! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are 12 distinct Special Weapons, which are almost too many (some of you may never use). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, as unique and accomplished as this game is, it's far from perfect. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For one thing, this game is long! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a -- kind of a lack of variety. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whereas the best "...Zelda" clones give you a wide variety of environments to explore, "...Guardian Legend" is a series of interconnected rooms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really not that different than the huge dungeons of "Deadly Towers". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And almost every room has enemies to fight. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, lots of enemies is not necessarily a problem; you encounter lots of enemies in R.P.G.s - but you also get experience from fighting in 'em. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In "...Zelda", you could collect jewels, the here? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... What do you really get from fighting enemy -- enemies? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not much! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They sometimes drop credits, but really there's not much need to actually fight them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I found [myself] running out of rooms before the enemy spawned, most of the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I'd be foolish to call "...Guardian Legend" a bad game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Over the years, it's found, uh, quite a following. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Check out the user reviews on GameFAQs, for example. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 People love this game! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It had -- does have a certain hip cachet, especially for being a well-made title, from a respected developer, that didn't really sell a lot of copies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it can claim to be, sort of, a lost classic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the fact that it's a crazy combination of a Shoot-'em-Up and a "...Zelda" clone just, sort of, adds to the appeal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It's] certainly one of the most fascinating and unusual titles we've seen so far. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Contra 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "3030" ♪ by Deltron 3030

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 09 🇯🇵 // 1988 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All the interesting games is up to they're all, sort of, scrunched together, I'm afraid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next up is none other than Konami's "Contra". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If that title screen looked a little different, well, there's a good reason for that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll actually [be] playing the original Japanese version in a fan translation from Stardust Crusaders. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much like "Karnov", quite a bit of stuff was dropped for the U.S. release, such as the introduction and the cool little transitions between the levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So playing this version of "Contra" is like watching a Director's Cut of a movie you've [only] seen an edited version - sort of, an all-new experience. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We learn here that "Contra" takes place in the 27th century in -- near New Zealand! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The U.S. manual indicates the game's, uh, takes place in 1987 in the Amazon basin. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either way, aliens have established a secret military base on planet Earth, and you need to take on the aliens and their boss, Red Falcon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's, sort of, a weird name for an alien overlord. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why would he named himself after an Earth bird? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese version even has, like, a "Ghosts 'n' Goblins"-style progress screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though thinking, back at the time, "Contra" seemed [pretty] similar to "Ghosts 'n Goblins" - sort of, similar art styles and gameplay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While, nowadays, we consider "Contra" to be a pioneering title in the Run-'n'-Gun genre, back in '87 and '88 it was just one of a handful of games in which you have to run from left to right and kill everything that crosses your path. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As mentioned, the Arcade version of "Contra" made its appearance in 1987, and was a substantial hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Military-themed games were becoming quite popular, at the time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Check out the "1987 Arcade Round-Up" in "Chrontendo ... 24" for other examples. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, the Iran "Contra" scandal was... been in the news for a while. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The idea of naming a game "Contra" seemed [pretty] bold, but it did fit in with the whole, kind of, "Rambo" thing that was going on, back then, along with movies like "Predator" and "Commando". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Military dudes with big guns was a major entertainment sub-genre, at that time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the more familiar U.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While the game plays the same, all the story and cutscenes have been dropped and the graphics have been altered. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This went on to be a huge hit and one of the most popular games for the system. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in Europe, the game was released as "Probotector". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, you see, apparently, people killing other people in video games was considered bad, so everyone was changed to robots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! Sorry about that, Europe. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the Japanese version, again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note the foliage just kind of swaying around in the background. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a lot of nice little details like that in this version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In Japan, publishers had control over the manufacture of their own cartridges, and Konami use special memory chips for "Contra". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., Nintendo themselves manufactured all the carts and then sold them to the publishers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the U.S. "Contra" had to be redesigned for Nintendo's chips. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and here's one of the between-level cutscenes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Lance (or is it Bill?) radio's in his progress and then the map screen will show ya, as you make your progress towards Red Falcon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, about "Contra": I assume most of you are familiar with this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It alternates between side-scrolling sequences and pseudo-3D sequences where the cameras behind your back and you run down corridors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object here is to shoot out the locks of each door, moving down the hallways, until ya reach the boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The hallway sequences are a bit annoying and don't quite fit in with the rest of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not to mention that the enemy soldiers look really goofy the way they jump around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later 'Contra' games would drop these altogether or replace them with top-down sequences. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A major factor in "Contra"'s appeal is the two-person gameplay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In both the Arcade and the home versions, two people can play simultaneously. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was becoming standard practice in Shoot-'em-Ups, but was still kind of unusual in Platformers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The great thing about the 2-Player co-op is not [only] is there no downtime or waiting turns but -- (uh, both gamers are always playing) but it also made the game a bit easier. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, however, Europe got the bone, as the Arcade version used alternating turns for the 2-Player version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another thing that "Contra" brought from Shoot-'em-Ups, as well as early Run-'n'-Guns like "Gun.Smoke" was the power-ups! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Contra" has lasers, flamethrowers, and so on, but there is [???] one weapon that stood out, above all the others. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know what I'm speaking of - this one here, the mighty Spread shot Gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With, this in your hand, you can just wreak death and destruction, taking out multiple enemies at once, hitting bosses', uh, weak spots easily. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once ya get that gun, make sure you don't lose it! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On that last boss, you may have noticed a certain influence from the movie, "Alien". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll see it again later, as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Regardless, that was, sort of, like, another gigantic Konami boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I'd be remiss, if I didn't mention one other noteworthy fact about "Contra". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually very hard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The entire series is notoriously difficult! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There is some debate as to which is the most difficult game (maybe "Contra: Hard Corps"), but this one is still [pretty] tough! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fortunately, the famous Konami Code can be entered in on the title screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will give ya 30 lines, which seems like a lot but, in this game, 30 lives can be squandered. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One hit will kill you, after all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, look at this! Moving trees and snow! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's actually snowing in Japanese version! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, thank Konami's proprietary VRC2 chip. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Things do get a bit hectic in this level - not [only] are the soldiers shooting at you, but someone in the forest is, like, tossing grenades. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, once again, the Spread shot is your best friend. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The level's boss, in particular, is a bit of a pain with a regular gun, but can be taken out in about three seconds with the Spread shot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well finally, ya make your way to Red Falcon's boss for the final few levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's helpfully decorated with flamethrowers mounted on the walls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose it's better than having "Mega Man"-style spikes sticking out everywhere. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And again, some of these sequences can get kind of tough. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh! Here we get treated to another cool cutscene. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this, you make your way into the weird alien inner sanctum of Red Falcon... which actually looks kinda like the final level of "Wai Wai World". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As mentioned earlier, "Contra" virtually defined the Run-'n'-Gun. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sure, earlier games like "Commando" "Ikari Warriors" established the basic concept. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But "Contra" was like the Run-'n'-Gun "Gradius". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It providing, sort of, the model for subsequent games in the genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the Run-'n'-Gun was a [pretty] major genre in the late '80s and early '90s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll see other Run-'n'-Gun for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's another boss inspired by the "Alien" movie. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As always, Konami's very high standards placed "Contra" far above similar games (like Bandai's "Lupin the Third", for example). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everything from the graphics, the sound, the controls is really top-notch. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we finally come to Red Falcon and he's a... giant pulsating heart? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, the Japanese version has a few details not found in the U.S. version, like, sort of, the ground and aliens all, sort of, pulsating. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! That'll take care of them! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, coming up here is another scene not in the U.S. release, as they escape on a helicopter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and ya think as they get away the base is gonna blow up? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, of course, it's a Konami game, right? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least, uh, in these games the bases always have the courtesy to wait for the heroes to actually escape and get far enough away before self-destructing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If I were a video game villain, I'd set my base to blow up the second I died. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least that way, I'd get some post-mortem revenge. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, and, by the way, the Japanese version has a little secret hidden message at the end, which we'll see in just a moment. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there we go! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another classic game from Konami! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How do they keep doing it? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We have a couple more Konami games this episode, neither of which is very interesting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But they do have a few more good games, coming out in a few months. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... But -- So don't expect the flood of awesome Konami games to stop anytime soon. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dragon Quest III 🇯🇵 // Dragon Warrior III 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 10 🇯🇵 // 1992 March [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Chunsoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Enix 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here it is, folks the hugest old-school Japanese R.P.G. ever (or at least the biggest in Japan) "Dragon Quest III", which begins very modestly - no title screen or theme music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You enter your name and the game starts rather suddenly! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The famous 'Dragon Quest' theme music does play, at the end of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Possibly the actual "Dragon Quest III" logo doesn't appear until the end of the Japanese version, as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When Enix releases "Dragon Warrior III" in 1991, they added a new title screen, which matches the style of, uh, that in "Dra..." -- "Dragon Warrior II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They also created some new cutscenes, which depict the protagonist's father, Ortega, fighting a dragon... and then falling into a crater. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting that the guy's name is 'Ortega'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is the first Hispanic video game character? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This scene is actually [pretty] cool. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I like the way that the dragon's wing keeps flapping, even after you cut it off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps this was added in to avoid complaints about the lack of dragons in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the game officially starts with you being waken up by your mother. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! Today is the big day to follow in your father's footsteps and go on some kind of heroic quest. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, ya have to hit the castle and have an audience with the King, who tells you to kill some evil being who's threatening the world and gin... -- then gives ya 500 Gold. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As is always the case with these Japanese R.P.G.s, they're always a bit cheap. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'd think, if you're gonna save the world, they'd give ya more -- more money than that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, the castle contains various locked rooms and those out-of-reach treasure chests. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By now, it's already an R.P.G. cliche. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Guess we'll have to find the key and come back later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But first, gather your party. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest III" abandons the structure of "Dragon Quest II", where you need to, like, run around, looking for the rest of your party - instead allowing you to create them from scratch at the tavern. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You pick a name, then choose a character class. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than the, uh, R.P.G. standard classes, there's a Merchant and a Goof-off, which have specific uses but are not generally useful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One nice touch: You and your party start with basic weapons and armor, something which can be exploited to earn extra cash at the very beginning, if you like. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Final Fantasy", you, uh, can create new characters and swap them out, at any time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, characters not actually fighting battles won't earn any Experience. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's been stated before that a major part of the 'Dragon Quest' appeal in Japan is the nostalgia factor. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It has a certain 'comfort food' appeal. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Certainly, that's on display, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Music, sprites, [and] background tiles are often taken directly from earlier games, though Toriyama has designed a whole bunch of new monsters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest III" is sorta like "Dragon Quest II" but bigger; the game mechanics are virtually identical, but there's a bigger map, more spells, armor, [and] so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A few things have been added, uh, but a 'Dragon Quest' fan could [pretty] much pick this up without ever having opened the instruction manual and have no problem. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Dragon Quest' is not always reinventing itself, like "Final Fantasy". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is structured basically as a series of fetch quests. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That is to get some clues from an N.P.C., go to the nearest dungeon, get to the bottom, and then find the key or magical flute or mystic amulet, 'til you make progress into the next area. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've just used, for example, a certain magical globe, which will open up that previously locked area. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here are the typical 'Dragon Quest' dungeons, with certain areas invisible until you actually enter them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start off on a relatively small island but soon find a passage to a larger continent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Heading out, you'll encounter various quests (like here, for example, an entire village is asleep). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nearby you'll find a hidden elf village, where you learn that the Elf Queen is responsible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, you have to go about setting things right, by heading to the bottom level of a cave and retrieving some sort of object. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, as the 'Dragon Quest' games progressed, an emphasis was placed more on storytelling, rather than innovative gameplay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The games contain little vignettes and interesting characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That particular tradition more or less begins, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The playable characters are complete ciphers and never say a word. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you will encounter many N.P.C.s with their own little stories and problems for you to fix. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 An emphasis on tragic or unlucky lovers seems to pop up a lot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Final Fantasy had a bit of this, but "Dragon Quest III" really makes it, sort of, the focus of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Taking the Dream Ruby back to the Elf Queen will cause her to give you the Wake Up Powder. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Little sad story, here). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there is one rather generous touch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... The game gives you your teleportation spells to get in and out of dungeons, uh, [pretty] early in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, while the dungeons can be tough at times, they aren't quite the hellish nightmares as, like, those in 'Final Fantasy', where ya have to, like, fight your way out of the dungeons, after getting the Quest Item. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One new thing, here is there's actually betting, um, on Monster fights inside the Monster Arena. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can actually gamble money on this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably one of the most creative and amusing moments in "Dragon Quest III" is here, where after completing a quest for the King, he is so pleased he offers you this throne! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After becoming King, you can walk around in his royal get-up and talk to everyone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Princess, in particular, seems quite pleased (maybe even a little bit too much). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can't leave the castle, but you can explore the town and talk to everyone (who are quite eager to flatter you). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But eventually the game must go on so you've tracked down the old King. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] turns out he's actually hanging out in the, uh, Monster Arena, enjoying civilian life. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to talk to him to convince him to take back the crown. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, all in all, I'd say that sort of like, the N.P.C.s and the various, sort of, other characters are a bit more detailed and realistic than they were in "Dragon Quest II". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned, a number of new spells and enemies have been added. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As expected, there's all kinds of nasty status ailments they can inflict on you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Stealing Magic, Poisoning, and Sleep are among the, uh, common with one new one, Confusion, which causes you to attack your own party. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, as you can see here, you have quite a few helpful spells, as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Attack spells, support spells, things that increase your, uh, Offense, increase your Defense, that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah, here we go: enemies that'll put your entire party to sleep. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [This is] definitely among the most painful points in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Dungeons are a bit more creative this time around, as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are still the usual towers and caverns, but they mix it up a bit! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one right here, for example, is an actual pyramid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! I found the second key. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are actually three levels of keys in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another new feature is the day and night cycle, sorta like "Castlevania II", the enemies get tougher at night and the village is all shut down. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But night has its advantages, as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [At a] couple of points, you can sneak into an otherwise inaccessible area, at night. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, here in the town of Isis, well, um, at night everyone's asleep. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there was one door, in particular, that's always guarded during the day. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [I'm] going to sneak into the castle and open that door, now. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! I can finally get to those treasure chests. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, once you manage to get the necessary keys to reach those locked treasure chests, the results are always disappointing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whereas "Final Fantasy" would reward you with, like, these powerful weapons and whatnot, 'Dragon Quest' usually just gives ya small amounts of Gold and common items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a bit of a shame. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also sneak into the Queen's chambers at night. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] turns out she's quite pleased to see you and will give you a helpful item, the Wizard's Ring, which will refill a small amount of your Magic but can [only] be used a finite number of times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Being low on magic is a common occurrence in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later on, in the game, you'll need to sneak into an evil King's castle at night. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Use a special item (the Mirror of Ra) on him, and it's revealed he's actually a demon in disguise as a human! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently the game designers liked this little plot twist, since they used it twice in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's another village where the King turns out to be a monster, taking human form. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We do see one little issue, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Often the overworld sprites Look nothing at all like the battle screen depictions. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That guy was a little winged ding... -- demon a moment ago, but now he's a troll. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, after various adventures, you'll finally get your hands on a ship. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now you can explore the rest of the world... which, interestingly enough, turns out to be roughly the same layout as the real world - with cities and locations similar, uh, in location and name to their real world counterparts. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, the pyramid is located in what would be Egypt. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another very cool thing is a town you help create. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Upon finding a settlement, you'll learn a Merchant is needed to get the town started. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is really about the [only] useful thing you can do with a Merchant. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya add one to your party and bring him back here, he'll leave your party permanently, but the town will grow as the game progresses, and even has his own little subplot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a very nice and creative touch. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's even a little "Sokoban" minigame involving pushing boulders around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here you can see I've replaced my Pilgrim with a Goof-off. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Note that female Goof-offs are dressed in Playboy-style bunny suits. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, Goof-offs are useless in battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They can't use very much equipment and they have really awful stats. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And often in battle, they won't even obey your commands. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When they do manage to hit, they'll usually do, like, maybe 1 Damage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's best to get your party Leveled Up and then add a Goof-off, once you're strong enough to get by with [only] three functional members. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you need to Level him Up to level 20. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why? Well, once a character has reached Level 20, you can change Classes at this one particular shrine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The overall best class is the Sage, who can learn all the Pilgrim and Wizard spells - and can even equip a decent armor and weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's kinda like, sorta like, the best of all -- all worlds, kinda rolled into one class. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Goof-off is the [only] class that can switch to a Sage, without having a rare item, called The Book of Satori. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So at Level 20, you can switch your class, but they will start back at Level 1 and keep most of their stats. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So your Hit Points will not actually drop all the way back down, even though you're now at Level 1 again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you will still have all your spells. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, since very few Experience Points were required to Level Up at first, you can Level Up your new class [pretty] quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... Granted, this is not nearly as cool as the class system, like in, uh, "Final Fantasy III". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it is nice that "Dragon Quest III" gives you some customization options. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sally is now a Sage and she levels up, like, three levels on the very first enemy we defeat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here's another interesting moment. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your hero has to face one particular dungeon, all by himself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later, there's a dungeon where you can use no Magic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Final Key is the third key that you get to come lock any door in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tonguebear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's an odd name for sure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At another point, you need to use a thigh bone to find a mysterious ghost ship, sailing around the ocean. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, once again, it's to find some sort of mystic thingamajig, required to open up the portal to... somewhere or another. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, by the time this came out, 'Dragon Quest' was enormously popular in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, Japan got even more 'Dragon Quest' crazy, buying tons of copies of this game (almost 4 million copies!). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, "Dragon Quest III" is the third-biggest selling FamiCom game in Japan - after "Super Mario Bros." and "...Mario ... 3". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] was the best selling Japanese R.P.G. for 12 years, until "Dragon Quest VII" came out in 2000. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sold more copies than "Super Mario World" and more than "...Link to the Past" and "...Ocarina of Time" combined. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, as you may recall, on the "Famitsu Readers' Poll", this game came in at #3, meaning it was the highest-placed 'Dragon Quest' game, and the highest-placed 2D game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually, it's been remade, you might recall this Game Boy Color remake from 2000. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from more detailed graphics, this also offered a bit of backstory and lengthy introduction, showing Ortega's adventures. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the best version of this game is definitely the Super FamiCom remake, released in 1996. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from the beautiful graphics and sound, the gameplay has been sped up, the menu is less aggravating, and there's even additional content added. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was recently given an unofficial English translation. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if you want to play "Dragon Quest III" on an emulator, this right here is definitely the one to get. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well anyway, back to the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dragon Quest III" does spice up a bit, adding in some fancy effects, like here ya need to throw a sword into a volcano, causing an eruption, which allows you to cross a previously unaccessible area. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You get all this screen shaking, flashing, and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot of lava will come out and dry, allowing you to cross over that little river, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the teleportation portals also use this crazy effect, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, having a spell that allows you to travel to [pretty] much any previously-visited city means these portals are not nearly as important as they were in "Dragon Quest II". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I will bring up a spoiler alert, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike the first two 'Dragon Quest' games, there are actually some surprises in store. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And "Dragon Quest III" (along with "Final Fantasy" and "Metal Gear") is one of the few games we've seen that actually contains, like, plot twists. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much of the second part of the game is traveling around the world, getting six magical orbs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, that sounds familiar, doesn't it, kind of like "Final Fantasy". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This eventually allows you to access the, uh, boss' castle and fight him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this guy is actually, sorta, too goofy-looking to be a real boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nope, it turns out he's merely the underlying, infinitely more evil guy called Zoma. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Right when you think the game's over, suddenly Zoma strikes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, now that I think about it, didn't "Dragon Quest II" have a, sort of, similar plot twist, where it turns out the, uh, the wizard you are fighting was actually not the real bad guy; there was, like, another even more bad guy, in charge of him? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, investigating a huge fissure that appears in the ground, your next [???] is actually gonna be to jump into the fissure, and then you will actually land in the world below. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, the whole day and night cycle stops, as it's always night in this world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it turns out this world below is... Alefgard (the world from "Dragon Quest (I)" and "...II"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Dragon Quest II", here Alefgard is a nearly perfect duplicate of that from the first game, right down to the guy who refills your magic for free in the first castle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though "Dragon Quest III" is clearly set in the past. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, one town, Hauksness, is a town here, though in "Dragon Quest (I)", it's [only] an abandoned ruin. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, one thing about "Dragon Quest III" is it is huge and long. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think "Dragon Quest II" get around maybe 11 towns and friendly castles, whereas "Dragon Quest III" has about 23 plus lots of shrines, caves, towers, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, quite frankly, I do feel the game, sort of, drags a bit in the middle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you obtain the ship and you're free to, sort of, explore the world, at will, the game doesn't really tell you quite what to do next. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems you can trouble around a lot, but there's a lot [of] dead ends. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, the game's focus actually becomes ru... -- r... -- running around the world, trying to collect those six spheres. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, while the game's strengths is all the little stories that happen, after a certain point, the overall narrative arc becomes a bit fuzzy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much like "Phantasy Star", after a while I was thinking, 'Oh God, another dungeon, another magic item to collect, it just never stops!'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is long! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will fight a lot of battles this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the very end, the toughest enemies will yield about 2000 Experience Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In order to learn the final spell for Sages, 'Sacrifice', your Sage will need to be at about 1 million Experience Points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, one little weird coincidental sim... -- similarity to "Final Fantasy", you need to find this rare metal, in order to have the best sword in the game made. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite all the details the two games share, [it] couldn't be more than coincidence because, you know, "Final Fantasy" came out, right before this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like I was saying, you'll need about a million Experience Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... In contrast, "Dragon Quest II" you were good at about maybe 50 to 75,000, so you've gotta keep leveling your characters up, and late in the game common enemies will usually do obscene amounts of damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And some enemies can attack up to three times per turn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the final dungeon, you encounter Ortega, himself, still alive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you'll witness an over-long cutscene battle, where Ortega dies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the time honored Japanese R.P.G. tradition, your party sorta stand around and watches while Ortega gets killed, since R.P.G. characters become helpless imbeciles during cutscenes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since your hero is silent, the whole thing occurs with absolutely no reaction on your part. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll encounter Zoma and the final battle will occur, but [only] after three sub-bosses in a row. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, you know, in many ways, "Dragon Quest III" is a huge improvement over the second game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's much more freedom in forming your party, and a lot of the small annoyances have been fixed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But much of "Dragon Quest III" just sorta feels like "Dragon Quest II", [only] with more stuff (more spells, more weapons, more towns). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I should point out: Despite this video being very long, we're [only] seeing a tiny fraction of the stuff in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it's still the same design, same music, same battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The [only] major chain which allow you to create your own characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But after "Final Fantasy"'s combat system and elemental affinities, it's kinda hard to go back to 'Dragon Quest'-style battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's still things I hate, like using a powerful spell that sucks up tons of Magic Points... and then having it miss three out of four enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And constantly struggling with the limited inventory, and the crazy menu systems where, in order to open a door with a key, you have to: open up a menu, choose a character that has the key, select the key, and then select 'Use'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But still, taken them on its own terms, the game succeeds and remains, I guess, sorta the pinnacle of the old-style Japanese R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this, uh, Enix and Chunsoft would switch tactics a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The next game wouldn't come out for two years. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first three games were released within about a 22 month period. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The next three would actually take seven years. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then 14 years for the three after that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, in some ways, the entire series peaked with this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know if you caught the big surprise ending, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, once you go back to the King of Alefgard, he then gives you the new name of Erdrich. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And so it turns out that you are *the* Erdrich, who was mentioned so much in "Dragon Quest (I)" and "...II". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] clever ending. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So is this the best FamiCom game ever? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, we'd probably say, 'No, it's not.'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is it playable? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's a little long and frustrating. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... I'd say actually check out the Super FamiCom version, if you wanna try one version [of] "Dragon Quest III". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But by creating a game this successful, Enix was obviously doing something right. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Exciting Soccer Konami Cup 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 16 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And now for something a bit less ambitious. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All fair-to-middling things must come to an end, I suppose. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the end has finally come to Konami's FamiCom Disk System series of Sports Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is "Exciting Soccer" Konami Cup", the final game in Konami's 'Exciting' series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I know. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Get ahold of yourself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's okay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll go on somehow. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably most interesting thing about "Exciting Soccer" is all these stats for the various teams. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, Kick, Running, Defense, Luck. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing I've discovered through 'Chrontendo' is the pervasive influence of R.P.G.s in Japanese games, around this time period. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even Soccer Games are now employing numerical statistics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, go ahead, pick your team (which you can rename if you wish), and then choose a play option. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So far, not too exciting. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, probably the craziest thing about "Exciting Soccer" is the bird's eye view of players. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is intended to look more realistic, like Hudson's "Power League" for the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the problem with this is that the results always look kind of ugly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Exciting Soccer" plays like your typical Soccer Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You kick the ball around, the game will automatically switch ya from one player to another, as the ball gets passed around. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's very easy for a goalie to block a ball, so scoring is difficult. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I can see games tending to end in 0:0. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And unfortunately, even the halftime show is really lame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It features Pentarou the Penguin, but Geez! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everything about this game screams of *lack* of excitement, despite the game's name. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While this game is hardly terrible, it's certainly no "Double Dribble"; that's for sure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's now time to wish our fond farewells to the Konami 'Exciting Sport' series. 🍇🍌

🤖🍪🍊🍓 February 18th hosts not one but two oddball games! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, does this one looks familiar? "Karaoke Studio" Senyou Cassette Vol. 2" from Bandai. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's even the exact same title screen from Volume 1. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It even has the 1987 copyright date on it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Load the thing up and even has the same songs! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To refresh your memory, this is a series that goes along with a microphone attachment Bandai made. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sorta the karaoke version of the Family Trainer series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I really don't understand the purpose of this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, it seems like it's almost the exact same cartridge as the last one in the series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are a few new songs but most of the songs and graphics are repeated. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so the reason for this thing's existence a bit of a mystery, but I guess we don't have to worry about it, at this point, since there never was a "Volume 3".. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Matsumoto Tooru No Kabushiki Hisshou Gaku 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Imagineer 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In a very weird disconnect with image sound and content, we have this title screen which combines Scott Joplin's jaunty little tune, "The Entertainer" with the ultra-Japanese image of cherry blossoms fall into a pond, in a game about playing the stock market. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Huh! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Matsumoto Tooru No Kabushiki Hisshou Gaku" an oddity from Imagineer, a publisher that seems to specialize in oddball games (or at least games that seem a little inscrutable to Western gamers). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this one here is a Stock Market Game; 'kabushiki' means 'stocks'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! The idea is to play the stock market and make a lot of money. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm going to assume that Matsumoto Tooru is a real person (presumably a well-known figure in investing, or a guy who writes guides to financial markets, or something like that). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The main screen is where you buy and sell stocks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... That's actually, sort of, what I'm doing here; I'm gonna buy some stocks from this guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If nothing else, the gabe -- game gives you some amusing illustrations of various actions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, good thing you don't play the stock market myself! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If my performance in this game is any indication, I would not do so well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than the actual trading, you do some other financial-related activity, as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, you can check out the fax machine, or teletype (or whatever it is) for news and tips. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [You] can look at performance graphs - you know, that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've heard that, in Japan, the FamiCom was considered to be, sort of, strictly a toy for children (even more so than in the United States) while P.C.s were the preferred platform for adult gamers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But clearly there are exceptions, such as this game, which was definitely aimed at an older audience. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's some '80s technology, right there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This must have done well enough to warrant a sequel, which is a more ambitious-looking game that came out about a year later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Imagineer would eventually go on to release games that are a bit more familiar to Western gamers, like "Super Turricon" and even the, uh, Super Nintendo version of "Wolfenstein 3D". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can, sort of, see from the results here, I'm not exactly a financial whiz. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, an interesting looking little game, but probably one that most folks will wanna shy away from. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tetsuwan Atom 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 26 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Home Data 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah Konami, your winning streak is about to end. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is "Tetsuwan Atom", based on a world famous character by Osamu Tezuka. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In English, we, of course, call him 'Astro Boy'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Astro Boy is the heavily-armed little robot boy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He made his debut in the manga form in 1952, and naturally animated series, movies, and so on followed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'Astro Boy' is perhaps the longest-lasting and most well-known character from Japanese animation, so it's a shame this game isn't better. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems that a pack of thieves have stolen a treasure chest from Professor Ochana Meizhou and Astro Boy is attempting to chase after them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least that's what it appears is happening, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Astro Boy can't be hurt by touching the enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, uh, while you can jump on them, and run into 'em, and even h..., ah, hit them and knock them down, they are all carrying bazookas, which will blow you up with one hit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much like the 'Takeshi Kitano' game, repeatedly hitting an enemy, uh, that you've knocked to the ground will eventually kill them - because, of course, you're a... murderous android and beating humans to death with youre fists will give ya 500 points. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, so far not too bad, but here's the game's first huge flaw. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It comes in flying. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jumping three times in a row, will activate your jetpack (that's what I'm trying to do here) or at least it's supposed to. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's absurdly hard to get timing just right, and usually involves jumping around for about a minute before suddenly, for no apparent reason, your jetpack kicks in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is way, way, way more difficult than it needs to be. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Finally! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If, by some minor miracle, ya actually get airborne and make it across the ocean, the game switches to a generic FamiCom Platformer mode - with awkward controls as a bonus. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, right here, for example, I got stuck, goin' into this room, and need to actually punch out those hieroglyphic things in your way, which are blocking the [staircase], which is weird because they look like they're painted on the wall! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But somehow they're blocking you from leaving? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This doesn't make any sense! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later enemies won't always kill you with one hit, but they do drain your Life Bar a little bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can call on Professor Ochana Meizhou to refill your energy, if necessary. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All this weirdness is [pretty], uh, typical for the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's not much sense of internal logic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And none of this really feels like it has anything to do with Astro Boy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another irritating moment here, trying to jump over that hand - and not get, uh, killed by those balls of fire constantly, uh, flying through the air, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oop! Whoop! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I got hit by one that I couldn't even see! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After about a million tries I finally got through. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oop! Not, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] turns out this game has been, uh, tied to a contract developer called Home Data, who nowadays publishes games under the name, 'Magical'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 None of their output seems to be very, uh, noteworthy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a shame Konami took such a popular character and produced a lame game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, you have to run around ringing bells in the correct order, based on the sounds that enemies make. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So not a very enjoyable game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully Konami will come up with better next time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tantei Jinguji Saburo Yokohama Renzoku Satsujin Jiken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 26 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sakata SAS 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's another Data East game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This time it's a sequel, the second 'Saburo Junguji' game, the long-running Adventure Game series, one of which was released in the U.S. under the name "Jake Hunter" not that long ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, as you can see on the title screen, this takes place in Yokohama. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The series almost seems to be heading in, sort of, a travelogue direction. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, when you think about it, many of these Japanese Murder Mystery Games mention a specific city in the title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The trend seems to have started with the "Portopia" game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Heck! The full title of that game was "Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken" and this is "...Yokohama Renzoku Satsujin Jiken". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Data East is not exactly trying to hide their influences, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [The] first game was on the F.D.S. system, but this one is a cartridge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might think this is further proof that publishers were jumping ship on the F.D.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the series went back to disks after this... and then back cartridges. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start with this introduction, which shows you the characters of the game and then it gives little descriptions (in English, oddly enough). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We learn that Saburo Junguji is notorious detective, whatever exactly that is im... -- supposed to imply. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is full of Yokohama landmarks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya see the Marine Tower in the background on the very first screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Among the locations you'll encounter are the Yokohama Stadium (which is the home of the Baseball team, the Bay Stars), as well as Yokohama, Chinatown, and all that sort of thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 By now, we've seen enough [of] these games to know how they work. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You talk to some people, get some information, open up some leads, head to a new location, talk to more people. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The plot here involves a girl who mysteriously disappears and later turns out to get murdered. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It's] nothing we haven't really seen before, so we'll be moving right along. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Replicart 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 February 26 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One last Japanese game from February, "Replicart" from Taito! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you've got a wild fire-breathing dragon of some sort, a Roger Dean-style logo, and one really annoying sound effect! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what is this? Some sort of Action R.P.G.? Maybe a "...Zelda" clone? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, not quite the actual game turns out to be a bit surprising. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this right here is gonna be one of the least helpful intro screens I've ever seen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This fellow is pointing at a map of Japan - doesn't really tell ya anything about the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then, here we have what looks like a moving fish skeleton. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But no, that's the dragon that you saw on the title screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, by the way, this game has some really annoying loading screens. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've removed those for your convenience. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, once you start playing the game, you'll realize it's just a clone of an ancient Computer Game called "Snake". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is really a port of an M.S.X. 2 game, released in 1987 by Sony. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The name, 'KLON', is listed there, by the way; they were also responsible for the M.S.X. "Topple Zip". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The M.S.X. version has better sound and graphics, but the games seem [pretty] much identical. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is really just the millionth version [of] the game called "Snake" (or sometimes "Worms"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The forefather of this type of game was "Blockade" a 1976 Arcade Game from [???]. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Atari had a version, called "Surround". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 [A] few years later, a variation appeared on home computers, such as, uh, the TRS-80, the Commodore Pet, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's one of many clones; it's called "Tapeworm" for the Atari 2600. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The idea was that your snake moves around, eating apples to make him longer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually he gets so long, it becomes a challenge to move around, without hitting yourself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However in "Replicart" the main challenge is the controls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most such games use simple controls (like: up is up, down is down, and so on). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Replicart" makes you use the left and right buttons, which make the snake turn left or right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is relative to the snake's point of view. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, for example, if you're moving left and you want to head towards the bottom of the screen, you hit Left on the D-Pad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you wanna then head back towards the left side of the screen, you hit right. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Needless to say, this control scheme is [pretty] hateful. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's also very difficult to time the terms correctly, so you often turn a pixel too quick or too slowly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, once again, Taito shows some strange judgment, licensing a title from another publisher, which is itself a clone of a decade-old Computer Game that's already been released on every single system known to man. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, they must have been [pretty] desperate for games to release! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 28 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I'm glad that's now out of the way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember back in "Chrontendo ... 27" when I mentioned that 1988 would see a bunch of Military Strategy Games come out of Japan? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, the first wave is coming up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So be prepared. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, more U.S.-[only] games from LJN and Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we'll see you then!. 🍇🍌
