👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chronsega Episode 2 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 Thank you for tuning in to "Chronsega Episode *2*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Much like [our] *sister* series '*Chrontendo*', [we're] looking [at] every game released for the Sega *Master System* in chronological *order*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Last time we covered the first batch of Sega *releases*, going up [until] mid-[*1986*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, we're starting off with August [*1986* and] going up to [February] *1987*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One notable thing [that] happened in *June* [1986]: the Sega [*Master* System] was released in the [United] *States*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Unlike] Nintendo*, Sega didn't dilly *dally* when [it] came [to getting out] a U.S. *version* of their Mark *III*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In *fact, [we'll] be* seeing the first U.S.-[only] *games* [released for] the Master *System* - three [titles that] came out *in* [1986]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Unfortunately*, the release dates of many U.S. [Master System titles have *not] been* [well documented]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [we'll just have to] come [to] them when we [feel] like it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, [without] further *ado*, let's *begin*! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Action Fighter 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 August 17 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We begin "Chronsega Episode *2*" (and [August *1986*]) with "*Action* Fighter". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *hell*, [that] was a [pretty] cool animated *title* screen! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In "*Action* Fighter", you're some [sort] of secret agent engaging [in acts] of military *sabotage*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I love [the fact that] when [you] receive [your] orders from the *President*, they [are actually *important* enough to be signed] by the [President] *himself*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But he [doesn't] sign his name - [just] the word 'President'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], as the game *launches*, [your first thought will] be, '*Hey*! This looks, [sort] of, like "*Spy* Hunter" - [only] on a *motorcycle*!'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] yes, "Action Fighter" is, more [or] less, t... -- [than] -- an enhanced clone of "*Spy* Hunter". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *this game* was also [released] in *arcades* in 1986. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Note that Sega [is putting out] -- *very recent* games [out] on the Mark III. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The selling [point of] the *Arcade* version is that it's, uh, "Spy Hunter", [but with different sorts] of *vehicles*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya start] off on a *motorcycle* ([can] be switched to other modes of *transport*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But really, uh, how much [secret] agent work is done on a jetski? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the *Arcade game* was [pretty] cool [and] had some rockin' *music*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Mark III* [port, however], uh, leaves a bit [to] be *desired*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The music takes a [pretty] serious *hit*, [for] example. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Let's, uh, take a listen [in just] a *moment*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There. See [what] I mean? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, you [can collect] weapons upgrades, uh, though not [to] the extent of "*Spy* Hunter". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya may [have] seen the *Sega* van just a [moment] *ago*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just like in] "Spy *Hunter*", [when] you pull up [behind] the van [and] go *into it*, uh, you'll [get] some new weapons [outfitted] (um, [like] machine guns [or] missiles [or] *something*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Collect enough of] those [letters and] you'll [be] able [to] turn into [another] *vehicle*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One rather bizarre thing [*about*] this game is that, uh, there's [quite a] few *ambulances* on the road - [and] you [can] actually, uh, [get points for shooting] them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess the [President obviously doesn't] *mind* if there's a [little] *collateral* damage on this mission. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe in [*later*] missions, you'll, uh, be killing *journalists* [and] Red *Cross* workers. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One lesson [ya have to] learn [in] this game is *not [to] drive too fast*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have a *timer*, [but] there seems {to} be [plenty] of time - so *drive* slowly [and] take [it] easy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 (Oh! {I} [was just] killed by my own *van*, there! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Damn you, *Sega*!). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Mark*, uh, III version [has only] *two* vehicles [instead] of *five* - the *motorcycle*, the *car*, [and] the *flying* car! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once [your] car gets its *wings*, the game becomes [a] rather unexceptional v... uh -- vehicular [*Shoot*]-'em-Up. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is *tough*, uh, if [you] lose [your] *power*-ups, because the regular *weapon* is actually [*pretty] weak*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now eventually ya go through {a} few screens of this, uh, [sort] of, "Xevious"-like, uh, vertical [*Shoot*]-'em-Up here *and* you'll, uh, reach the boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] the first level [It's] three submarines [that] keep submerging. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then [you're] on [to] the next miss... -- mission (there's, uh, *five missions*, [altogether]). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [while] this is [not] really a *bad beginning* [for] this episode, it's *hardly* an exceptional game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hopefully [we'll] see some, uh, more [*interesting* titles later this] episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Spy Vs Spy 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by First Star | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega's [release] schedule [was still pretty *sporadic* at] this point. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Action* [Fighter]" was the sole [release for] *August* [and then] we skip ahead [to] the third week of *September* [for] "Spy [Vs] *Spy*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] *those* [not in] the know, "Spy [Vs] Spy" was [originally released] for U.S. [computers] in [*1984*] by [First] *Star*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The strange thing *is* Kemco had [released] a *port* for the *FamiCom* [in April] of [*1986*], thus making "Spy Vs *Spy*" ([along with] "*Choplifter*") one [of] the first titles [to] be [released] on both Nintendo's *and* Sega's *systems*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Because of Nintendo's *policy* [that] FamiCom [releases] to be [*exclusive* to that] *system*, we [*won't*] see this happen very [*often*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *this* case, [First] *Star* ([and] *Brøderbund*, who [released the original version] of "*Choplifter*") [weren't] Nintendo *contractees*, because they [weren't releasing] these games [*themselves*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Sega*, apparently, did their own development on ports *for* these [*titles*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 1987 [will] actually see the first *chinks* [in Nintendo's] armor of [exclusivity] appear. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *eventually* Sega [will get] tons of [third-party] developers [and] publishers [in] their *corner*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But in] the *meantime*, [don't] expect [to] see a whole lot [of] *games* coming [out] on both *systems*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [what about] the game *itself*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's [*pretty*] similar [to] the FamiCom *version*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Ya [might] remember the Cold War-themed "Spy Vs Spy" *cartoons* [from] 'Mad *Magazine*'.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You play [as] either the *Black* or the *White Spy* (here I'm the White Spy) against either the computer [or] another *player*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You're looking [for] v... uh -- various [*objects* (secret] plans, a [passport, et] *cetera*) in the miscellaneous *hiding* places ([behind pictures and] so on). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can also plant] *traps* in those same [hiding] places. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That's what the] thing on the [right] is for; [it's] called the *Trapulator* [and] you [can select] the bombs ([or] buckets of water [or] whatever) [and then] attempt to kill [your] *opponent*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now *once* [you've gotten] *everything* you go [to] the [airport and] fly *away*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] several [different] levels, each one bigger [and] more complex [than] the *previous* one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] I guess this is a unique [and] clever *idea*, I *never really* cared for [it], *myself*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Both this [and] the FamiCom version are *[pretty] ugly*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps Sega's version is [slightly *better*] looking (or [at] least has [brighter] *colors*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Fans* of the 'Spy [Vs] Spy' games ([and] they're certainly [*out*] there) may [get, sort] of, a notstalgic *kick* from this, but [for] *everyone* else [it will] seem like a [pretty] minor [title] for the Mark III. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Circuit 🇯🇵 // World Grand Prix 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's time [for] the first Mark III *original* [title] this *episode*, "The *Circuit*", [eventually released in] the U.S. [and] *Europe* as "World [Grand] *Prix*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *And*, as you have undoubtedly *guessed*, "The Circuit" is a *Racing* Game - a *Formula One* Racing Game, {to} be exact. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (F1 Racing being quite [popular all over] the *world*, except the [United] *States* where stock car racing has a far bigger *audience*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And if "The Circuit" feels, sort of, familiar, *well*, it's basically just "Hang-On" on four *wheels* (or maybe it's an updated clone of "*Pole* [Position]"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [However], how come in *all* Racing [Games], *all* the [other] cars [start] off going much faster [than] you? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's *really* [not] fair. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, [and] one thing [about] this video: 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Because the frame [rate] doesn't *quite* match up with the frame [rate] of the actual game itself, some [of] these striped lines running down the road [will] look a [little bit] *weird* ([not seem to be ver... -- moving] very *quickly*, [or] standing still [or] something like that). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] "The *Circuit*" has you racing against {a} *timer*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Finishing a course *quickly* enough [will allow ya to] move on [to] the [*next*] course. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You have two gears (high [and] low, [up] *there*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And your] main concern is [just] avoiding [the other] *cars*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, [your] *fellow* racers [*don't*] drive very *carefully*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In *fact*, they *all* seem [to] have [sort] of a deathwish. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Cars [frequently] change lanes *directly* [in] *front* of you [while you're] tryin' [to] *pass* them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you'll [often find] yourself zigza...ing [around] c... -- *zigzagging* around cars [while] *passing*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Like a [*lot*] of Racers of this *era*, "The [Circuit]" does have you *travel* through a variety of *backgrounds* (nothing too [*exciting*], [but it] does help differentiate [between] the *tracks*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, the *one* thing [that] sets "[The] Circuit" apart is... *R.P.G.* elements. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *That's* [right]; in "The *Circuit*" you [can] *buy* stuff [for your] *car*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... That's '*de rigueur*' in Racing Games *nowadays*, [but *not] so common* [in *1986*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] upgrade [your] acceleration, [handling], [and] *engine* speed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Depending on] how quickly you *finish* a *race* you'll win *points*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Between y... -- [*rounds*], you'll have the [opportunity [to] s... -- [to *spend*] the *points*, um, on those various *upgrades*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This all seems very s... -- vaguely, uh, similar to the [power-ups in] "[*Fantasy*] Zone". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (As [ya can] see, I have the better acceleration equipped in *this* race.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *bad news*: 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *parts* [only] last one race. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So, don't] think [you'll end] up [with], like, a super pimped [out] *car* [or] anything like that. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Ninja 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 09 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*The Ninja*" perhaps the most boringly [titled] ninja game *ever*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once again, [an original title for] the Mark *III*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "The *Ninja*" has a [*reputation* for] being a [difficult] *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Admittedly*], the first [few] times *I* tried [to] play [it], I [found myself getting] killed over [and] *over* again [and] throwing my controller down [in] *anger*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, *after* a while, I took a deep breath, cleared my mind, [and reconsidered] my approach. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Since [this] game resembles a vertical *Run*-'n'-Gun, I was playing [it] as if [it] were "[*Commando*]", hiding [behind] cover, jumping out, spraying throwing knives everywhere. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, *as [it] turns [out*, this is pretty] much the *wrong* approach [to] take to "The Ninja". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, I ended up *thinking* of "The Ninja" more [as] like a Vertical [*Shooter*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's [*actually] two* ways you [can] attack. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... One [button] will fire in the direction [that you're] *facing* ([just like in] "*Commando*", for example). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *other* [will] *always* fire straight up, [no matter] which [direction] you [are] facing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Using the *second* option *turned* [out to] be the key [to] success - slowly *advancing* [and] then [retreating] when enemies *appear*, [shooting] them [while] they *chase* you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} turns [out your] character is [actually] *very good* [at throwing] weapons behind [his] *back*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now *once* ya [get] the power-[up, it] lets [you start] using the, uh, *throwing* stars. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game becomes a [little] easier, since you'll, uh, know ya have more *power* [and] *range*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's also *Blue Scrolls*, [and] ya may [have seen] me [collect] the, uh -- the *Green Scrolls*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [We'll] discuss those [in just] a moment. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Altogether*, there's 13 levels, *each* with a *boss* [at] the end. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *They tend* [to] vary from [your] standard vertical [ground-based] levels, with enemies [appearing] as ya move *up* [to] *more creative* levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [These] levels tend [to] be the *toughest*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [For] example, there's one where [you're running through some kind] of *avalanche, one* where [you're] on *logs* moving down the *river*, [and] (perhaps the most *interesting*) one [where you're] in the middle of a *horse* stampede. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Luckily*, you *get* the special ninja *power*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 By pressing *both* [buttons *together*], you [can] *vanish* for a second (excellent [to] use [in situations] where ya [can't] dodge [an] enemy or [projectile]). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In *this* level, [ya have to] climb [up] the [side] of a *wall* to the *castle* where the main *boss* [lives]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On the way [we're] gonna find [another one of those] damn Green *Scrolls*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They're usually *hidden* in some weird random spot. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One [little], uh, *quibble* [with] "The Ninja": 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *same* three *bosses* [are repeated] over [and] over [and] *over* again [and] usually one [of] these two guys [throwing] a *boomerang* or one guy in the later levels who has a gun. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On the final levels, ya reach the main bad guy's *castle*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This is a good *example* {of} how [to] deal [with] the *groups* of *enemies*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Move up* relatively slowly [and] *cautiously* watching [out for] enemies [to appear]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When they *do* appear, try [to get] *around* ['em]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then shoot up as [you're] running [away from] them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you [actually use] this technique, uh, *helps* you [*quite*] a [bit] in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here's one of the easier bosses (there - a guy [just], uh, [shooting] a gun [at] you). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And we're at the] very *top* of the game; or *so* [it] *seems* - [this] is the final *level* ([though there's actually a little] *surprise* coming in [just] a *moment*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, once [you kinda get] the *hang* of [it], "The Ninja" [is] certainly [not] a hard *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though there is *one* big *frustration* [you will] *find* is that... once you [get] all the way *to* the end [of] this level, you [get a little] *message* saying, 'Hey! You [didn't collect] all the Green *Scrolls*.'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya *have* [to] go *back, [repeat*] the game, and [find] the [rest] {of} the missing *scrolls*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Which, as I mentioned, *they're [pretty*] well *hidden*.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [in] this case, [it] sticks [me] *all* [the] way *back* [to], like, uh, Level *4* [or some'm] like *that*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then I have [to] go find all those Green [Scrolls] I [didn't] find earlier. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess no game is [*perfect*, but] this one [is] actually [not] bad [for] the [most] *part*, other [than that] rather [ridiculous] *ending*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [haven't seen] the *real* ending *yet*, I [will *admit*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, maybe one [of] these [days]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Alex Kidd in Miracle World 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] now we finally come to a major *turning* point in the Sega Master System *history*, the release of "Alex Kidd in Miracle World". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Alex Kidd..." is probably the second most well regarded *game* for the Master *System*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, [in] *my opinion, really* the [first] game [that could] compare [to] the kind of stuff being [released] *on* the *FamiCom*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] *see*, "Alex Kidd..." is a Scrolling *Platformer*, a genre [that exploded onto] home consoles in [*1985*], with the release of "Super *Mario* Bros.". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the *second* "Alex Kidd" *game*, [the first] being this *Arcade* [title released] earlier [in *1986*], "Alex Kidd: The [Lost Stars]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "...The [Lost Stars]" was *clearly* "...Mario..."-inspired; as a -- Run-'n'-Jump *Platformers*, go it's, uh, [pretty] standard. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega was [just starting to get into] the Scrolling Platformer *genre*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A *similar* [title], "Wonder Boy" was [released the] same year and [we'll] be seeing [plenty] of "Wonder Boy" in [the] *future*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, for "*Alex Kidd* in *Miracle* World", Sega [greatly *expanded*] on the *gameplay* of "...[Lost Stars]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] *one*, Alex is, uh, no longer a helpless *toddler*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's now a full-fledged martial artist, [capable of] killing enemies [and] smashing [blocks] with his bare *fist*, using a technique [that] was bizarrely named 'shellcore'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And for] some reason [this results] in him, [sort] of, [getting giant] fists, [with] which to [destroy] enemies [and] smash *rocks*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If *Alex* obtained a special *ring*, he [could] then throw [*sort*] of like *fireballs*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] keeping with [the] recent [developments in] video *gaming*, R.P.G. elements were added *in* such [as] this *shop* here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Alex now collect equipment [and] special items, (uh) [find] money, [purchase] things [in] *shops*, [and] there are [vehicles] (such [as] this *motorcycle*) [that] Alex [can] ride. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This thing [will allow] ya [to plow] through enemies [and] *rocks*, [though there] *are* [these little] red spheres [that can] knock you off the bike. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([Actually quite similar to] the skateboard [in] "*Wonder* Boy".) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [We're] about [to] come up to one [of] the game's [first] bosses, {a} guy named Stone-Head. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One of the [quite] odd *themes* in "Alex Kidd [in] Miracle World" is the 'Rock, Paper, *Scissors*' theme. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The main boss is [named] '*Janken*', which is [what] the game of '[Rock], Paper, [Scissors]' [is] *called* [in] *Japan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, each [of his] cronies *challenges* you to a *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And this is really] one [of the] more [irritating] *factors* [in] "Alex Kidd..." because, well, a [certain amount] of *luck* [is] required [to defeat] the *bosses*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 These *early* bosses [return *later* in] the game where they [not only], uh, ya [have to defeat at] 'Rock, [Paper], *Scissors*', [but] then [fight] them in, like, a more normal boss-style fashion. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One [of]* the nice things [about] "Alex Kidd..." is [there's] a [*lot of*] variation [in the] *levels*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Each one is different, [and] you've [got] a "Ghosts n' Goblins"-style *map* [between] levels [to] show [your] *progress*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *game* begins on a *vertical* level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Recall [that] "Metroid" (the game [that] really, uh, [sort] of, put, uh, [vertical and horizontal] scrolling [*together*]), had [only] been [released] a few [*months*] ago. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Throughout] the game, there [are vertical and] *horizontal levels*, underwater levels, levels [in] the air, castle levels, [and] *so on*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's one [of] the, uh, several "...Mario..."-esque *underwater* sections, um, [and] a nice-[looking] *octopus* there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Controlling* [your] player [underwater is actually quite] a [bit] trickier than in "Super *Mario* Bros.". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And *then*, more towards the *end* [of] the game, [there's actually] two *castles*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *these things* [are] much bigger [and] more *complicated* than King *Koopa's* castle [in] "...*Mario* Bros.". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [These] sections *require* some [*pretty] tricky* [platforming and] *jumping*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, these levels [almost seem like] a [prototype for] the '*Mega* Man' games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One negative *comment* [about] "Alex Kidd...": the *controls*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] *character can* be hard [to] control and (*rather sadistically*) the *game puts you* in *several* [situations] where *very* precise control [is] *required*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A lot [of] great games have those annoying Platform [sequences that] really make you [*hate*] the game [and] "Alex Kidd..." is certainly no *exception*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here*, [for] example, ya have [to] move [your little] helicopter through all the red [*balloons*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Hitting] one [will] cause [your] helicopter to, uh, be *destroyed*, [for] some reason. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you [have to] keep pushing the button [in] order [to get your] helicopter [to] go up; it's kinda like swimming in "Super *Mario*...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Actually navigating *through* these things is *really hard*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And your] vehicle has *momentum*, so it's hard [to] *stop* it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now this last main le... -- level *really* takes things into, uh, Platform hell. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This level [is] *huge* [and] *maze*-like; *lots* of spot-on jumping is *required*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *this would [not]* be a [*problem*] if everything [*weren't*] so *slippery*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Alex moves like [he's] on a [waxed] *floor*, so sliding off [platforms] is a [constant] worry. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] is a, uh, very *cooly* [designed] *level* and [would] be *fantastic*, if [only] the *controls* were a [little *tighter*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And [for] me the *single most [hateful* moment] in [the] game is [*right*] here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have [to] *swim* through some tight spike-filled *passages*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And *seriously*], this is [like] tryin' to, uh, thread a *needle* during an *earthquake*; [it] took me *many*, many tries [to get] through this one *screen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [*seriously* wonder how many people] gave up [and] never saw the end [of] this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Should you [miraculously get to] the end [of] the *level, you'll face* the main boss, 'Janken', himself. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [As] *far* [as] *bosses go*, those in "Alex Kidd..." are not too tough. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [They] usually have [some] very simple technique by which they [can] be *defeated*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 With '*Janken*', all ya have {to} do is [stand] real close [and his projectiles will] fly over [your] head, [then you can jump up and hit him in] the face. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([Sort] of *lame* final boss, actually). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [However,] once you've [defeated] him and [found this little] Princess Peach-like *lady*, the *game* [is *not] over*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, you [still have to] find a *crown*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There *is* this *odd* [little] final *level*, which is very *short... but* seriously *irritating*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 After using the *globes* [that] you've collected [to] enter the final *room*, you'll *need* [to] *step* on these *floorplates* in a [certain] order. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah, here we see the final room, right here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Stepping* on the wrong one [will] send down a [little] indestructible ghost [to] *kill* you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this [last *part*] is *really* all trial [and *error*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... [To put] the player *through* something [like] this after [getting] 95% [of] the way through the game is [*pretty] evil*, [and, sort] of, [ends] the game on a *sour* note. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Once* you've, uh, somehow managed [to] figure [out] the [correct] *sequence*, the crown [will] appear. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] grab it and you finish the *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then you [get] a rather strange pessimistic ending [text] scroll. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And (unlike "...Zelda", "Metroid", [and] so on {and} so forth) Sega [didn't] see fit [to] give this game *credits*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, "Alex *Kidd*..." a [great] *game*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, *almost* - [it] *looks* beautiful and [it] has [everything] you'd really *want* in an 8-[bit] *Platformer, except* [tight] *controls*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Fix the *controls*, uh, remove the various [randomized] deaths, [and] you'll [have] one [of] the all time [best] *Platformers* [of] the *era*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Alex Kidd *in* Miracle [World]" shows [that] Sega was ready {to} take its system [into] the [world] of modern console *gaming*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Unfortunately], while* Sega did, [sort] of, intend Alex Kidd [to] be a *mascot* for *Sega*, they were never really to come up -- able [to come up with] a, uh, completely satisfactory *sequel*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "...Mario..."-like fame, eluded Alex Kidd. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ashura 🇯🇵 // Rambo: First Blood Part II 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 November 16 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, this [next] game [is] a [bit of] a [disappointment] after "Alex *Kidd*...", [to] say the *least*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The last of *three* games [released in November 1986] is known in Japan as "*Ashura*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As the game loads *up*, [we'll] see it's a [straightforward] clone of Capcom's "Commando" and SNK's "Ikari...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya control a little] *dude* who looks [just] like the guys from "*Ikari*...", armed with an *extremely* [short] range machine gun [and explosives]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Meanwhile], a whole army of *soldiers* try [to] *stop* you by *walking* around [and shooting] *randomly*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Rather [than] *grenades*, you [are] armed with explosive-tipped *arrows*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] use these arrows against *enemies* or [to] blow up the *huts*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Inside the huts [are] P.O.W.s. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And ([just like] in SNK's much later, ' Me...l -- Metal *Slug*' games) they [are quite] happy to see you [and send] some ammo [your] way. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *in* the U.S., this was [released] as "*Rambo*...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This makes *sense*, because (after all) "Ikari..." was clearly based on the movie "Rambo: First Blood Part *II*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *sprites* have been slightly *altered* [and] the [between] level *screens* [have] changed [but otherwise], it's the same game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In *Europe*, however, [it] was released [under the] name "Secret Command", [for] some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, I **should* [point out] that, uh, "Ashura" is, uh, [obviously] based on "Ikari...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And it] was -- seems [to] be trying to *compete* directly with the FamiCom *version* of "Ikari...", which came [out about] a *week* after "Ashura". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *while* the FamiCom "Ikari..." is *generally despised*, I myself like "Ashura" a [lot] *less*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*That's* right; it's actually] *worse* than the "Ikari..." [for] the *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh...[The] graphics [and] *colors* [are better, but] the gameplay is much more [stripped]-down (no tanks [or] anything like [that]). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Much* like "[Ikari..." and] "Commando", we have this well-[guarded] gate [separating] the *levels*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have [to] kill the soldiers [while] avoiding the tanks' *shells*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The enemies' explosives have a [*pretty*] decent radius, so, uh, *they're* a [bit] of a pain [in] *the ass*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Throughout*] this game, there's [*pretty*] much enemies [*constantly*] pouring down [from] the top of the *screen*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's, uh, *hella* hard [to hit] anything [with your] rather lousy *machine* gun. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And it's] *even damn* hard [to hit] the *huts* with [your] explosive *arrows*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have [to] be [at just] the [right] *distance* or [your] arrows [will] pass [right] through the *huts*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *here*, [of] course, is a big [question about] this game, 'Which came first: "*Rambo*..." or "*Ashura*"?'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game was [released in] both the U.S. [*and*] Japan [in *1986*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*And*] while [it's often *assumed* that] "Ashura" [was] the *original* version, I'm *[not so] sure*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega *was* tryin' [to break] the *Master* System *in* the *U.S.*, so [it] *would* make sense [that] they'd develop [some] games [specifically] for the U.S. [*market*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I *wonder* if this [was *originally* designed] as "*Rambo*..." um, [but without] the 'Rambo' *license* [outside] the *U.S.*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] *character* in "Ashura" [looks just] *like* John Rambo [from the] *movies*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you *have* the rather distinctive use of bows [and] *arrows*, which *must* [have] come *from* the "Rambo..." *movie*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [it's *quite] possible* [that] "*Ashura*" is the, uh, altered *version* of "Rambo...", rather [than] vice *versa*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Either* way, "Ashura"/"Rambo..." is a rather boring, frustrating, [vertical] Run-'n'-Gun. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Astro Warrior 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 14 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Our last] game of November [*1986*] is "*Astro* Warrior", which is *actually* the *fourth* [Shoot]-'em-Up [for] the Mark III so *far*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Compared [to] last episode's "*[Fantasy]* Zone", "*Astro Warrior" seems* like a very minor *entry* [in] the *genre*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega must {have} [felt the] same *way* because, [in] *Europe*, they [didn't even] bother giving [it its] own [separate *release*], [but] had [it] share a [cart] with "...*[Pit]* Pot", of all things. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It was *also* put] on a [cart with] "*Hang*-On", [at] one point. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Astro Warrior*" resembles a [lot of] Shooters of this *era* ([it] looks kind of like "Star Force", or "A.S.O.") with a rather generic space station type [*setting*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game [looks] a [lot *better* than] last year's "Satellite *7*", [but] *still* suffers from [unexceptional design] and boring *enemies*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] least [it] does have bright [crisp] *colors* [and] nice [fiery *explosions*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "*Astro Warrior*" does have a rather unique system [for] *power*-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 After [shooting] so many [of] those [little] raised *blocks* [that] you keep seeing on the *space* stations, a [*power*-up will] drop down (uh, speed increase, weapons upgrade, [that sort of thing]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, the *upgrades* [are clearly] taken [straight] from "*Gradius*", which had been [released for] the *FamiCom* earlier [in the] *year*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the first *boss*, *Zanoni*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [while] he doesn't really, uh, *look* [that] bad, he *actually* is [surprisingly] easy ([at] least if [you're] fully powered [up]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just *blast* him] a few *times* [and he] fades away. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 He will [return *later*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or [at *least* that's] what I *think* [this is] trying [to] *tell* you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [undoubtedly] *noticed* in that *section*, the [*lasers*] do [look just like] the lasers [in] "*Gradius*" [and ya *do* have these little] *option*-[like] things [that] attach [to your] ship, [and] they are completely [*indestructible*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One [thing* about] "[Astro] Warrior": [it] *is* a [short] game, just three levels which [are] all [quite *similar*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Really*, uh, you [can] more [or] less, uh, see everything in this *video* [that] there is {to} see in the entire *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you [are] *fully* powered *up*, the game is *extremely easy*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You *lose* [your power-ups] if you *die*, [but] you really [shouldn't] be *dying* much [in] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Every once [in] a [while something might catch] you off *guard*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [For] the [most part], you [can] either kill or avoid enemies *very easily*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 After [the] 3rd *Level*, the game simply [*repeats*] ([getting slightly] *harder*), [but] you'll [probably get] *bored* [before] ya lose [all your] *lives*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] the [*most* part], it's [just], uh, wave after wave of generic enemies coming *down* [at] you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [we're] *coming* up *soon* to the *third* boss, [Belzebul] ([sort] of a, uh, rainbow-flavored boss). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [just like] the other two, he's a big pussycat. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah, here [he's] coming up, *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] lasers [will just *shoot* right] through [him in] *seconds*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then ya go back [to] Level 1. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I *guess* he looks [kind] of cool [with, sort] of, the, uh -- the [multiple] sprites [and] the arms, [sort] of, moving around. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well, "Astro* Warrior" [is] really no [different than] all the other mediocre Shooters releases, uh, [for] the *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The graphics are a [little *better*, but] the gameplay is basically the *same*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] Master System *really* [never] became known [for great] *Shooters*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... There's "*R-Type*", [the] '[Fantasy] Zone' games, uh, [some Compile] games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *oddly enough*, the, uh, Sega *Saturn* [and] *Dreamcast* ended up being, [sort] of, uh, Shooter-intensive concolt... -- consoles, [whereas] the [Master System] was *not*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Choplifter 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Brøderbund | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, it's time [to] take a look [at] some U.S.-[only] releases for the Sega Master System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *First* up is "*Choplifter*" - {a} port of the ancient U.S. Computer game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this *actually did* have a Japanese release ([*sort*] of); it was on the old S.G.-*1000* back in *1985*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is [*that*] version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [*modeled] very* clearly after the original [*Brøderbund*] game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The idea [is] *simple*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Fly [your] choplifter [until] ya [find] some [P.O.W.s], pick 'em up, and then [get them] safely back [to the] *base*, avoiding [enemy] fire. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Funny* how so many video games back then involved [rescuing], uh, [P.O.W.s]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They were very much in the public *consciousness*, back in the *1980s*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *However, also* in 1985, *Sega updated* the game [and released it] as an *Arcade* title. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Funny how the *title* screen makes [it look] like [your helicopter] is firing on a *bunch* of *friendly civilians*.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Arcade* game version, uh, featured much more [state-of]-the-[art] graphics (more enemies, [parallax] scrolling) though the *core gameplay* was [still] the same. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Strangely, Jaleco* [released] a port, based on the Arcade "Choplifter" [for] the *FamiCom* in June *1986* in Japan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Thus "Choplifter" became *one* [of] the few games [for both] {the} FamiCom *and* the Master System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Due to Nintendo's restrictive *terms* back then, *most* FamiCom games were *exclusive to the FamiCom*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Additionally*, [it] was [also released] on the Atari [*7800*] back in *1987*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [it] *was one* [of] the few games [to be released] on all three 8-bit *systems*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], *this* Master System [port] is [*pretty*] faithful [to] the *Arcade* game (much more [so] than "*Action* Fighter", [for] example). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, [ya know], I guess it's [not that] bad. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I've [already expressed] my *opinion* [about] "Choplifter" back in "Chrontendo Episode *9*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It seemed pretty] impressive, when [it] came [out in] the early *'80s*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] it's, [sort] of, on the boring side, *now*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I suppose the Master System *is a* [little better than] the *FamiCom* release. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Unlike Nintendo, Sega* [began] focusing on the U.S. market *almost* immediately. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Master System was released [*in*] the U.S. in June *1986* [and] by Christmas there *were* [around 20 titles available]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *fact*, [in] 1986 more [*titles*] were [released] in the U.S. [than] were actually released in *Japan* [that] year. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Sega* began releasing U.S.-[exclusive titles] almost *immediately* [for] the Sega Master System. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *As* mentioned *earlier*, the [*release] dates* [of a *lot* of the] U.S. [titles have not really] been [preserved]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I [don't really] know [*exactly* when] "Choplifter" came [out] (other [than] sometime in 1986). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I assume, obviously, they were tryin' [to get] some [titles] on [the] shelves [in] the U.S. [before] *Christmas* time. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, [while] Sega was trying very *hard* [to compete with], uh, [*Nintendo* for the] U.S. [market, *it didn't*] really work [out for] them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Both systems were on the shelves in time for, uh, *Christmas 1986* [but Nintendo] ended [up, of] course, kicking Sega's ass. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing* [about] this game: I *never* [understood] why the [enemy] forces [don't just] *blow* [up your] *one* [little] tiny defenseless *base*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, they have all those [*jet* fighters]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, to reiterate [what] I said [about] the FamiCom version of "Choplifter", *I* guess it's [not] a bad side-scrolling [sort] of, uh, [Shoot]-'em-Up-type game - [kind] of in the [style] of, uh, "[Defender" or something like] that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] by [late 1986], we were [starting to] see games [like] "*Gradius*", [so] "[*Choplifter*]" [begin to] look [*incredibly*] old-*fashioned*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Great Ice Hockey 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the last Western-[only release we'll] be taking a look [at] *here is* "Great Ice Hockey". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] I [should probably] say a couple things [about] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [First of] all, it's [copyrighted 1986] but no one [really] seems {to} know [for] sure [exactly when it was released] (either [late] *1986*, or sometime in 1987). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [We'll] go ahead [and] stick [it into] the [1986 category]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And [*additionally*], this game [is not] very well *playable* [at] the [moment] *because* you need a special *controller* called the Sega Sports Pad. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One nice [little] detail here: you hear the country's, uh, national anthem played when you se... -- [make your selection]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And this is a pretty nice-looking little] *game*, [as] you [can] see *here*, [and *actually*, sort of, beat] Nintendo [to] the *punch*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They [didn't] have an Ice Hockey Sports Game [until] *1988*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the *Sega Sports Pad* was a special *trackball* controller [that] was used with a couple *Sports* [titles] (this one [and] "Sports Pad [*Football*]"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Like* a [lot of] *peripherals*, [it] was [released and] then almost immediately dropped ([sorta like] Nintendo's R.O.B.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game [can't really] be played [without it; it's impossible to] play using a *D-Pad*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] you [can], sorta, [get] a good idea [of what it] *looks* like. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's actually much] nicer-*looking* than Nintendo's later "...Hockey" game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [How does it] really *play*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well], I guess [it's kind] of hard [for] me [to] know [for sure, but] *there's* nice [little] details, [like] the, uh, referee who skates around, [and] so on, {and} so forth. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] this game [just] seems [to] be, uh, [sort] of, [mostly forgotten and, sort] of, uh, [just] a weird [little curiosity], more [than anything] *else*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Marksman Shooting & Trap Shooting 🇺🇸 // Marksman Shooting / Trap Shooting / Safari Hunt 🇬🇧 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's [another little curiosity], "*Marksman* *Shooting*" [and] "*Trap* *Shooting*" - the *companion* games {for the} Sega [*Light*] Phaser - a [Light] Gun *accessory* [that] Sega [released] in the U.S. [and] *Europe*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though [what] we're actually looking [at] *here* is the *European* version, which added a *third* game "*Safari* Hunt". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*Light*] Phaser was [obviously intended to compete with] Nintendo's *Zapper* for the N.E.S.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As ya may recall, "*Duck* Hunt" was all the rage when the N.E.S. [first] came *out*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *all* three games on this cartridge *are [quite similar*] to Nintendo [titles]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Trap* [Shooting]" is [exactly *that*] - a *trap* [shooting] game; [hit the] targets as they fly [*out*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya get points for every] hit [and] if you've [accumulated enough points at] the round's end, you'll move on [to] the [next] *level*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo, of course, had [already released] a *similar* game on the "Duck [Hunt]" *cartridge*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though Sega's game, uh, takes [advantage] of the [Master System's graphical *superiority* and] has a rather pleasant [looking] background. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Next up* is "*Marksman* [Shooting]" where ya fire [at your, sort] of, typical [shooting] range *targets*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game [will remind ya] of a less interesting version of "Hogan's *Alley*" - a *launch* [title] for the [N.E.S. in the United] *States*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [While], this game is [not] really too *exciting*, uh, [just like] "*Trap [Shooting]*", [some] care has been [put into] the background. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's all sorts [of little] details, such as the shadows [and] the broken pipes lining the walls. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You need [to hit] targets in the *chest*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A *headshot* (usually desirable [in] video *games*) [will not get] you any *points*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *last* [and] most interesting game is the Europe-[only] "Safari Hunt". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *First* [of] all, *[what exactly]* is the story with [that] weird-looking *assistant* on {the} [*title*] screen? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He's [undoubtedly supposed to] be [some sort] of indigenous *person*, but of [completely unidentifiable] ethnicity. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the game itself... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Geez! You certainly [aren't] a very *picky hunter*; you'll [*blast* anything that] *moves* (ducks, fish, *rabbits*)! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, most animals [have] a rather *humorous death*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll need [to] earn enough points, [before] ya [can], uh -- [before] ya run [out] of ammo, [in] order [to] pass [the] *level*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Some* animals are harder [to] kill [and] m... -- may [require multiple] *hits*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 On [the next] level, there's the bear, [for] example, [that must] be [*shot*] so [that he stands] up - [and then ya have to shoot him again in] the *chest*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In [the] level after *this* one, you'll even hunt spiders [and] *monkeys*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So, you're not exactly] a big game hunter! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've [*completed*] the game, a *message* [suggests that] you [get] a *real* gun [and start shooting] things [in] the *real* world! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes, here's the jungle level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, shooting at monkeys! Geez! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Safari* [Hunt]" is [definitely the] most challenging [of the] three games here [and] I do like the [bright] cartoony *graphics*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... [For] a really simple [Light Gun] Game, [it's actually not that] *bad*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 High School! Kimengumi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Almost*] every Mark III game we've seen *so* far *would* eventually be [released] in the U.S. for the *Master* System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *here's* one [that] was intended [*strictly* for] the Japanese [market], "High School! *Kimengumi*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Are ya thinking this [is] based on [an anime]? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [it] *was*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 'High School! Kimengumi' was originally [a *manga*] by Motoei Shinzawa, published in the popular '...Shōnen Jump' magazine. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] then became an anime *T.V.* series, which explains why this game was [*released*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *luckily*, [what] we have here is actually an unofficial English *translation*, so we *can* make some sense [of it]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, uh, the [little introduction] is [probably] the [most amusing part] *of* the entire *game*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 '*Kimengumi*' means roughly 'Funny [Faced] Guys' [and] the *series* [is] about a group of five High School [students] with odd *faces* (*so odd* they [can] cause teenage girls to *faint*, [apparently].) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yui, the redhead, swears revenge [for] the *humiliation* and [searches] the *High* School, hunting [them down] one by one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Your] objective is [to] capture all the members of the [Kimengumi] *gang*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *According* [to] this game, High School females [are] s... -- uh, *frail creatures*, uh, since [the sight] of a *frog* or a *cockroach* (or simply coming in [physical] *contact* [with] a member [of] the opposite sex) cause [them to] break down in *hysterics*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [what, sort] of, game is "High School! *Kimengumi*"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's *really* one [of] those old-school *Adventure* Games (the [kind that] were [popular] in the U.S., [around] this time) where basically, ya have [to] go around [collecting *items* and] then figuring [out] what [to] *do* [with 'em]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *this* case, the [various items are] *mostly* hidden [in] the desks, [so you, sort] of, enter every single room, open the desks, hope there [isn't] a cockroach or *frog* [that'll] cause the game [to] *end*, uh, [collect] the [items, and] then figure out [what to] do [with 'em]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In order [to] capture each member [of] the gang, you [have to] find, uh, their [particular weakness - or find the particular object that will], uh, be *effective*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [If] nothing else, this game is filled with, uh, grotesque and amusing *characters*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this guy, [for] example, you [have] to, uh, grab a *baseball* [and] then *throw [it* at] him. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [will result in] him being knocked *unconscious* [and] you [can] go ahead [and] tie him up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course one {of the} very first [items you have to find] is the rope, which is (of course, like [everything] else) hidden [in a] desk. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Like] many [Adventure Games], death [is *pretty] frequent* and often comes, uh, [simply] by *exploring* the *environment*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, the desk has a *frog* [hidden] inside. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Opening the *desk* [will] cause the frog {to} jump [*out*] on you and, uh, [instant] death! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, uh, "*High School!* Kimengumi" *is [pretty] nice*-looking. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [it] *actually is* [pretty] appealingly, uh, [bright and] cartoony. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] it does have [that sort] of, uh, 'keep trying [different] things [until ya just] *happen* [to find the solution]'-style *gameplay* (common [to] older Adventure Games). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 (Oh, there [your] friend, uh, [just, sort] of, kicks [him out of] existence.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe this [is] appealing to, uh, fans of old-[style], like, E.A. *Adventure* Games, [but for most] folks, well, [it's probably] more, uh, irritating [than anything] else. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 ([Don't] pick up the kettle! Oops! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once again, you've [lost the] game.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, uh, *this* is [certainly not] a *bad* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... If [you're not] a fan [of] the *series*, [it probably doesn't] make much *sense* [to] you, but it's, uh, [certainly] worth checking out - as being one of the, uh, *earlier* Japanese [Graphical Adventure] Games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Great Golf 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, [it's been] a [while] since we've seen a Japanese release [in] Sega's '[Great] *Sports*' series. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There was "[Great] Baseball", "...Soccer", [and] "...*Tennis*" in [*1985*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] a *whole year elapsed* [before] they [went] ahead [and] unleashed "[Great] Golf" [to] the world. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a few [different] gameplay *variations* [available and we'll choose] the standard [*tournament*] play, [*and*] there's options [for] up [to] four players. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *Sega* has chosen not [to] simply copy the *look* of *Nintendo's* "Golf" game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... But "Great Golf" rather gives you a, uh, nice-looking overhead *view*, uh, [at] a [slight] *angle*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike *Nintendo's* "Golf", the golfer *himself* is [not] *visible* [until he] swings the *club*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [*while*] this [doesn't] really *look* [like] Nintendo's "Golf", [it] does *play* [an] awful [lot] like it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The gameplay mechanisms [are] very simple [and pretty] standard. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya select your] club with the *D-Pad*, then choose [the] direction you wanna [hit] the ball *in*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] tap the [button] once [to *start* your] *swing*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then again a *second* time to [actually hit] the *ball*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 How full the swing [meter] is [will determine] how hard [your] ball [is] smacked. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And all [of] this, as I mentioned, *is [pretty similar*] to Nintendo's game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya have to] deal with the usual factors like wind [and] terrain. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, uh, "[Great] Golf" does have [flat] greens, [rather] than the graded greens [of] the *FamiCom* "Golf". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], of course, we do [have] these *sometimes* challenging courses with [water] traps (actually, uh, [you get *pretty] lucky* on [that] one [right] *there*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'll] choose one [of] the, uh, smaller irons there, f... -- ['cause I'm [just] tryin' to [hit] the ball {a} very short *distance*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And there's] a nice [little bit] of Engrish, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Nice on!". 🍇||


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, "[Great]* Golf" is a [decent little] *title*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I actually] do like the overhead view [of] the course, as [opposed] to Nintendo's '[behind] the *golfer*' view in their Golf *Games*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And unlike Sega's earlier '[Great] Sports' games, there *really* isn't anything very irritating [about "Great] Golf". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still*, [it must have] been lacking *something* since [it wasn't] *released* in the *U.S.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Instead* ([just like "Great] *Baseball*") a [*later*] Golf Game ("*Masters* Golf") was [*retitled*] as "[Great] Golf" [for] the U.S. market. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *what's with* all these Golf Games *anyway*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [certainly don't] recall having any *interest* in [them] when I was *young*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess they were [really popular in] *Japan*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Nintendo's* "Golf" was [actually] one of the system's [biggest] selling *games*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Believe it or not], [it] actually outsold "...Legend [of] *Zelda*" [and] "*Metroid*" [in] Japan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega was [just] clearly [tryin' to get] a piece [of that] lucrative golf video game market. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Space Harrier 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 December 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We [will] close [out] 1986 [for] the Mark III with "Space Harrier". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yes*, Sega saved the big guns [for] their *last* release of the *year*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This, of *course*, is a [port] of Sega's [1985] *Arcade game*, which was perhaps Sega's biggest Arcade hit [at] this *time*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Like most [of] their other big Arcade [titles in] the mid-'80s ("Hang-On", "OutRun", "AfterBurner", [and] *so on*) "*Space Harrier*" was the brainchild of Sega's top designer, Yu *Suzuki*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the original [*Arcade*] version, one of the most [technically] impressive Arcade games of the *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [When] "Space Harrier" originally came out, there [was] *really nothing like [it]* in the Arcades. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The impressive use of *speech* (uh, still *rare* back then), the absurd [frantic] speed [of] the *gameplay*, the *impressive* sprite-based 3D *graphics*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Space [Harrier]*", [at] the *time*, [seemed to] usher in a whole new era of *Arcade* games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 By *comparison*, the, uh, Mark *III* version, uh, looks [and] sounds much less *spectacular*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As we [can] see here, [your] character is a [little] *smaller* [and] the game is nowhere near as smooth as the Arcade version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though the game does still look [and] *play like "Space Harrier*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing they *did* keep was the agonizing death cry when you [actually hit] something. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One [of] the major selling points [of] the *Arcade* "Space Harrier" was the enormous multi-[sprite] bosses. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just] *look* [at that] thing! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The way these things came flying towards you, takin' up almost the whole screen, [it] was really amazing [at] the *time*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, by *contrast*, the Mark *III* bosses are, [*sort*] of, *messy* looking. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [But] still this *is very* impressive for a home *console*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] home systems, we've [mostly] seen [3D] used [in] *Racing* Games; uh, 3D [Shooters] like "*Star* Raiders" ([and] its various *clones*) were around. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But didn't] really offer this kind of crazy action with the screen filled with enemies, fireballs, [projectiles and] *so* on. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [while] the Mark III "Space Harrier" is *impressive* for [its] time, [it] doesn't really play [quite] the same as the *original*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The graphics [aren't] as detailed, the game [moves] much *slower*, and while the *Arcade* version had an analog *flight* stick [to] control [your] character, here [you're] stuck [with] the *D-Pad*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] since the Mark III [just] really can't *handle* having so much stuff on the screen [at] *once*, "*Space Harrier*" does [tend to] look a [little] jumbled [at] times, and *can* be hard [to] *play*, since [it's not always] easy [to] make [out] what's *happening*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *As* a [result], the Mark III "Space Harrier" is, uh -- [isn't] always [that] much fun [to] play ([at least compared to] the *Arcade* version). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's, [*sort*] of, like the old, uh, Atari [2600] "*Pac*-Man". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 On *one* [hand, there was, sort] of, this, '*Wow*, I [can] play "Pac-Man" [at] *home*!' factor. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, on the other hand, the experience [just wasn't] the same as playing it [in] the *Arcades*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Space* Harrier" was [eventually ported to] all *sorts* [of] home systems (Computers, the Turbografx-16, even the *FamiCom*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though the first home version [to] really [accurately *reproduce*] the game was the Sega 32-X in [*1982*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Until] then, this [will] have [to] do. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to 1987 January + February ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 Some *[interesting] things* [will] happen [with] the [Master System] in [*1987*], *including* the release of [probably] the [most popular *title*] ([at least] *nowadays*) for the system. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But], ya know, all that will have [to] wait. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] the *time being*, we're [just gonna] take a [look at] these two [last titles], released in January [and February] *of* '87. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Double Target: Cynthia no Nemuri 🇯🇵 // Quartet 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 January 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Good Lord! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *here* we are now [in] *1987* (fresh new *year*) [and what] does Sega unleash [onto] the public? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 How [about] "Quartet" (a [port of] their 1986 *Arcade* game)? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the *Arcade* "Quartet" (seen here) was [sort of] a "Gauntlet"-[inspired] game, which allowed for four players [at] once. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It also] had some nice, uh, [synthesized] *speech* in the *intro*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, I [*don't] think* "Quartet" was nearly [as] popular in *arcades* as the *Atari* [title] ([at] least [in the United] *States*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] may [have] been because the rather cool dungeon crawling action had been replaced by, [sort] of, [your], uh, typical less-than-inspired side-scrolling and, uh, Platforming [and *Shooting*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [as] I [mentioned], "Quartet" was for four players. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For the Mark *III* version, [only two people could] play [at] once. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, in *Japan*, the game was released as "Double *Target*: Cynthia no *Nemuri*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., [it] was released simply as "*Quartet*", thus [undoubtedly], uh, causing [some] disappointment [at] the reduction [of the] number [of] *players*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now [a] few things have been [changed between] the Japanese and U.S. *versions*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, [your], uh, [your] *character* looks [quite] a [bit] different. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Seems much older in the U.S. *version*; [I guess] we're a little girl [in] the Japanese one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *some* of the, uh, platforms [have actually] been made *easier* in the U.S. version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [If] you go back a [second] you'll see [that] some [of] the, uh, [very] skinny platforms [are] replayed by -- [replaced] by, uh, much w... -- wider ones for the U.S. release. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] is the Japanese version [that] we're looking [at] here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the *Mark* III port of "Quartet" *has* been substantially, uh, reworked from the *Arcade* version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... The *typical* soft colors of Sega's *Platform* Games, there, have all been replaced with the much brighter palette [of] the Mark *III*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *aside* [from] all this, the *main* [problem] with "Quartet" is [just that it's not] very good. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *really* is the simplest side-[scrolling] game imaginable. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Jump on [platforms, shoot] the [endlessly] spawning *monsters*, [get] a few power-ups like the, uh, [jet] pack - [which] makes the game much more enjoyable [to] play (well, not really *good*, [but not] nearly [as] irritating as [actually] jump everywhere), uh, [find] the boss, move on [to the next] level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I think ya actually [have to] grab a *key* in order [to get out] of each level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Despite*] the, uh, [pretty] graphics, [this is not] really [better] than [your] typical Jaleco or *Bandai* game [for] the *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is definitely] not, uh, top shelf *Sega*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Despite] being [designed] by the Sega Development Division *3*(who [were responsible for] most of Sega's big [hit titles] like "Altered Beast", [and], uh, "[Phantasy Star]", [and] *so* on), this game [doesn't] really seem like, ya know, one [of] the [best] things they [put] out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here is a rather annoying [little] section [right] here where ya, [sort] of, uh, *shoot* through all these [little] *bubbles* to, uh, go [*forward*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's, sort of, a, uh, jump [and] shoot, jump [and] shoot, {and} so on [and] so forth. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And we *have* sometimes heard of the [American releases] of games being made *easier*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But I [don't] really know [that] the original *Japanese version* "...Cynthia no *Nemuri*: Double *Target*..." really *needed* [to] be any easier. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's actually], uh, [*pretty] simple*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The platforming is, uh, really *easy*, uh, because, unlike "Alex *Kidd*...", every surface is [not] completely covered [with] *astroglide* [and] you [can actually jump] on the small *[platforms quite] easily*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The *bosses* [are *mostly* uninspired and] a [little] *boring*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This [guy right] here is [probably] the best one *I've* seen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Simply, uh, [ya know some] basic, s... -- uh, [shoot and] dodge [pattern will] usually work. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One *of* the [annoying] things: [every time ya get] *hit* ([and] you [can take quite] a few hits), you *lose* [your *jetpack*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [Sometimes] if you lose [it], like, on a place where [an] enemy *spawns*, you'll [sort] of be hit, fall, jump up [and get the] jetpack, [get hit] again, [and] so on, ad infinitum. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the bottom line: "Quartet" is just, [sort] of, a boring game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Loretta no Shouzou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 February 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our final game this episode is, [sort] of, a [*surprise*], "Loretta no *Shouzou*" which is a Text [*Adventure*] Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *fact*, it's a *detective*-[themed] Adventure *Game*, starring Sherlock *Holmes* (as you may [have] guessed from the *cover*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] also very heavy on Japanese text. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [we'll take just] a brief look. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*title*] means something [like] 'Portrait of Loretta', and [it] apparently concerns a missing *painting*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese Text Adventure Game [genre] was still a nascent genre [at] this *time*, having been [popularized] by Enix' *1985* game, "*Portopia*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Portopia" was [ported to the] *FamiCom* [and that] version adopted a menu-based *control* scheme, which would become standard on console [*Adventure*] Games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We've [already] *seen* a [handful of Adventure] Games [released] *for* the FamiCom in *1986*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] the genre was still coming [into] its own in early [*1987*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Loretta no Shouzou" uses the typical menu commands, like 'Talk', 'Take an [item]', 'Use an [item]', 'Move', {and} so on. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll [start getting] some, uh, *details* from this guy [right] *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *And* you'll travel [around] London, picking up hints, talking [to] various parties. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It *seems* very similar to "*Portopia*", [only] ya [don't have] the first-person *view*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Later [in] the game, there's even a *maze* section, uh, [just like that in] the Enix [title]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Portopia" [apparently*] sold [quite] well, so we *would* expect other publishers [to] release similar *games*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, this *is* an unusual direction for *Sega*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [Probably] the [*closest*] thing they [had] *released* so far was the, uh, "High School! Kimengumi" game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Graphically*, this game [doesn't] really [appear to] be [anything] *special* [and] looks [*about*] the same as [your] typical Commodore 64 [or] FamiCom Adventure Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And there's [almost] no music in [it - just] a few sound [effects] here [and] *there*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As we saw a [second] ago, you, [sort] of, [get around] town by going to a map screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, I've come [to] the [art] gallery [and talking to] the guy [about] the missing *painting*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... You [can] try [to] *take* a painting [from] the wall, but, uh, [it won't let] you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Oddly*, the *depiction* of Sherlock Holmes is *rather unusual*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He [doesn't really] *look* like his, uh, typical, uh, *self* in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In *Japan*, this [title] *seems* [to] be, ah, [*mostly forgotten* (presumably] due to the lack of success [of] the Mark III); [it was] never released in *America*, of course. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 From a *historical* [standpoint], "Loretta no Shouzou" is *[most] notable* as an attempt by Sega [to, sort] of, branch out [and release] games [for] the Mark III [that are] more *console*-like, rather [than] *Arcade*-like, as they have [been] doing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] a nice *try*, but, uh, "*Loretta* no Shouzou" [probably can't really] be [considered to] be a [success] by anyone's standards. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 2 Wrap Up ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, that's [it]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We're done [for] this *episode*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Next up*, [we'll] actually have a few more episodes of '*Chrontendo*'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *then* we'll have the third episode of '*Chronsega*' which will cover (Oh, I suppose) Spring of [*1987*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Until] *then*, see ya next *time*. 🍇🍌
