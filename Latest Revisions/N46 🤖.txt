🤖🍊🍓 Before we start this episode I, sort of, wanted to mention a few things today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I occasionally get comments wondering things about 'Chrontendo' like where "...Episode <ONE::1>" is and that sort of thing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I guess I have not actually done the very best job in promoting the fact that there is, in fact, a 'Chrontendo' blog which actually has been in existence for longer than I've been posting videos on YouTube. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I post entries on the blog on a [pretty] regular basis discussing how the new episodes are coming along as well as discussing other topics. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I posted a link here to the 'Chrontendo' Frequently Asked Questions would type updated recently. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this might able to answer some general questions about what 'Chrontendo' is, and where it came from, and where we'll be going, and all that sort of things. 🍇🍌

👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 46 ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Hey everybody, thanks for tuning in to "Chrontendo Episode <FORTY-SIX::46>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Last episode we covered all the Japanese games of June <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now before heading on to July, we did take a quick look at the U.S.-[only] games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At this point, the hugeness of the Nintendo Entertainment System in the United States had reached the point where at any given month, they were just as many games released in the U.S. as it were in Japan - sometimes more! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In June <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, we saw [only] five Japanese FamiCom games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the U.S. there were about <fifteen::15> for that month - <four::4> U.S.-[only] releases and around <eleven::11> games that were already provably released on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 These included "Mega Man <TWO::2>", "viability", "Super Dodgeball", a really new game - Konami's "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", and a virtual antique "Hydlide". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can now just see how crazy and mixed up the U.S. release schedule was, with "Hydlide" hitting shelves the same month as "Mega Man <TWO::2>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 No wonder people hate "Hydlide" so much! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, let's check out the <four::4> non-Japanese games released for June. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And they include a very weird game that is a personal favorite. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Airwolf 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Beam Software 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, opening up a new episode with a game from Acclaim; that's certainly a good sign. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's Alex Kord, giving you your orders. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Not the most aesthetically pleasing piece of art I've ever seen - old-school printer paper. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Younger kids might not recognize that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There's the "Airwolf" logo. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The wolf in sheep's clothing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Whoa, thinker moving quickly here! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm not pressing any buttons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game just wants to throw up each screen for about one second for some reason. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 That's as much as I know! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You haven't told me anything yet! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so Airwolf is taking off and oh, it's one of these games, sort of, like "Top Gun". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it appears I have to rescue prisoners. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Or assume that the stick figure on the map there is the prisoners. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You have two weapons, a machine gun type thing and fully guided missile. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, so (get this) you actually speed up by hitting the Start button. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I love Action Games that make me use the Start button in game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so I'm headed towards the prisoners, and here we are, and... 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "And whoop" is not the most intuitive game on the N.E.S.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You're probably going to have to read the instruction manual to figure out what to do when it comes to the question and how to play to avoid dying all the time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If this sounds a lot like a Computer Game, then you will not be surprised to know this was a product of a Computer Game developer, Beam Software, who were based out of Australia. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They were the guys behind the hugely successful "Hobbit" Adventure Game - one of the biggest selling Computer Games of the time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We took a quick look at "The Hobbit" back in our "Adventure Game History" special. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 They also created a "Karate Champ" knockoff called "Way of the Exploding Fist", which became an enormous commercial hit in the United Kingdom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's basically the "Street Fighter <TWO::II>" of the mid-'80s British computer scene. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It appears that "Airwolf" was Beam's first console game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They were going to specialize in crap - ports and license games with such stuff as the Nintendo Entertainment System "Back to the Future", "Dash Galaxy" and oddly the Super Nintendo version of "Shadowrun". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Note to self: insert wacky record scratch sound effect here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So "Airwolf"... 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once you reach the hostages, and that screen appears you immediately have to start hitting the Up button or your helicopter will plummet to the ground like a rocket explode. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You land by just, sort of, tapping the button a few times to slow your descent. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The question is, 'why did they put this in?'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, once you know how not to die instantly, there's really no challenge, compared to the rest of the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's simply a matter of pressing Up a couple times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If Beam didn't really want to put in like a real minigame, why not just use a cutscene? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's like video game busywork. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a pointless attempt, sort of, add a little content to a game with very little content. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And that's really all there is to the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's <twenty::20> levels altogether. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Later ones become much more difficult with more prisoners rescue, tougher enemies, and you'll need to worry about refilling between the prison camps. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But really, we've, sort of, seen the gist of the game here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Incidentally, this is the second 'Airwolf' game we've covered. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In "...Episode <FORTY::40>" there was the Japanese-[only] release and it was like a regular Horizontal Shooter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was, sort of, awful, but I guess it was more interesting than this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shooting Range 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I believe we have three types of Golf Games today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 First up is "Shooting Range". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 All confessed to actually liking that goofy music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, two options here: normal (that's creative) and hearty. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And these are the difficulty levels. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so let's begin. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is a Light Gun Game, as you figure it out by looking at the cover art a moment ago, which prominently features the Zapper. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When a game is called "Shooting Range", and the box art is just some screenshots that are almost completely obscured by a photo of a hand holding the Zapper, then you suspect that you were in for a very quickly made generic game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The selling point of "Shooting Range" is simply that you can use the app. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Stage one has a Western theme; naturally a shooting at Indians. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Haha what fun. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When you see an Indian walking by, sort of, minding his own business fireshot over his head and watch him scurry away. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What a great message to send to the kids and Bandai. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The actual objects to those little peppermint candy targets and rack up points. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Get enough points and you'll finish the level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If your energy or time runs out the game ends. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You lose energy when you miss, which will happen but some enemies drop interview refills. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And just as importantly, some drop extra time in the form of an hourglass. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 During Level <TWO::2>, you might experience a problem. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can't rack up enough points. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Monster seemed to arrive slowly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And even if you hit everyone, you still can't get close to the <SEVEN-THOUSAND::7,000> points required to complete this level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, sometimes monsters just stop appearing entirely and you'll sit and watch an empty screen as the time runs out you're sitting there helpless, waiting for something to shoot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But the solution to this is use the D-Pad to move the camera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yep, you can pan around and shoot more monsters. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Suddenly it becomes a piece of cake. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Brilliant. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So "Shooting Range" is one of those games that makes you use the Zapper and the D-Pad simultaneously. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For someone like me, who's an expert marksman, this is a real problem since for maximum proficiency when playing the Zapper game, I use a double handed grip and a weaver stance - the whole nine yards. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Having to fiddle with a D-Pad really messes up my mojo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This Bonus Round involves you shooting out bottles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Next Level is a space themed level and features lots of ripoffs from the 'Alien' movies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The alien second jaw seems to be coming of its back. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So have a way to screw things up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And the party game is just a weird whack a mole game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So yeah, it's a lames app or game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Let's move on. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Monster Party 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, now here we have a wild game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is one crazy-looking title screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Monster Party", published by Bandai and developed by Human. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For some reason this is [only] released in the U.S. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I have no idea why. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Man! look at Mark just walking down the street like he owns it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He has got some serious swagger going on. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That must be why he was chosen to help fend off an alien invasion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Kind of weird he was looking right at the star but somehow doesn't notice it descending from the sky and landing right in front of him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You know, I wonder if there's a name for this kind of humor, where the fantastic and the mundane are kind of mixed together in an unexpected or absurd way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like an alien named Bert. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You see a lot in stuff like 'owl' or "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", or even an RD or things like "starts no exit". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] cool intro. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a little bit of animation added in. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not exactly "Ninja Gaiden" but better than the typical stuff and I was putting out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Human Entertainment was definitely the good developer that band I used a lot as opposed to Tose, the bad developer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Human worked on several of those 'Family Trainer' games and later today, stuff like "fire pro wrestling" and, of course, the return to horse themes and "clocktower". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Monster Party" is, sort of, the defining -- one of the defining examples of classic on the N.E.S.. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not a great game from a technical or mechanical perspective. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, it's not "Super Mario ... <THREE::3>", or "Mega Man <TWO::2>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it's so weird and different that I can't help, sort of, love it... and kind of hated at the same time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Right from the start, this looks [pretty] weird. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have enemies who are guys buried upside down in the ground. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And your weapon is using a [pretty] unusual fashion. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a Baseball bat, which can, of course, be used to beat the enemies with. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But also you can hit enemy projectiles just like they were Baseballs. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So if someone shoots a laser at you, you can swing the bat and knock it right back at the children. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 When it comes to having lots of bosses "Monster Party" absolutely does not fall around. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This first boss is clearly inspired by "Little Shop of Horrors" and, sort of, trains you on the whole Baseball bat mechanic. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You need to swap those bubbles right back at it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One frustrating thing is you can't wait predict at what angle the bubbles are going to be returned out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some will get the monster; of those little sale right above it or below it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Killing a boss will net you a mystery item. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sometimes it's points; other times to help refill. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You never know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Certain enemies will drop hearts which refill your health. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As you can see your Life Bar down at the bottom there is actually has the potential to be [pretty] long when all filled up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And some enemies will drop what looks exactly like a standard pharmaceutical capsule. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This transforms you into Bert, who can't use Baseball bat but instead fires lasers and comply. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Monster Party" has a lot of really weird stuff. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One of the most infamous bits is the second boss who is already dead and tracting flies when you reach them, but is still able to talk somehow. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 [pretty] creepy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still a "Monster Party" his tone is relatively cute and friendly (little smiley faces everywhere) until you reach this giant Hanawon-type thing which looks, sort of, like a cactus. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And we get one of the great in what the fuck moments of <EIGHT::8>-bit game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Holy cow! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Look at all those rotting and bloody heads. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You would think Nintendo of America would have not given the seal of approval to something like this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But some publishers managed to get away with a lot more than others. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And Bandai I'm sure sold a lot of games for the system. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Perhaps they got a bit of special treatment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Most levels have three bosses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here's the last of the first level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As a rule, if you are a Bart, sorry -- if you are in Bert form, when you fight a boss, you can really just, sort of, power your way through the boss using the laser, as opposed to using the bat which will normally take much longer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Defeating the last boss here it gives you the key named x the level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Look at the screen between levels - skeletons in a pool of blood! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the settings used for the levels in this game don't really make much sense. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here, for example, we have a sewer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But at least to entertainment do not use the same enemies over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Each level has brand new monsters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But "Monster Party" is mostly remembered for his extensive collection of bosses, most of which are [pretty] strange - none more so than this trio of fried foods that attack you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 First of all tempura shrimp, than an onion ring, and then whatever this is - maybe Tonkatsu on a skewer or something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You'll have to fight these guys as Mark because you won't -- even if you are actually Bert when you enter the boss battle, you won't last long enough in bursts form to kill all three of them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Level three gets [pretty] spooky with these, sort of, macro cephalic skeletons popping up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Bosses include a Minotaur who throws out cute little cows at you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We also have a mummy who states that his legs are asleep and throw these bandages at you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I hope that her bandages. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And a giant spider. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And it's not clear whether or not this is the same type of creature that was found dead in the first level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some folks seem to think that it is; others think that that dead creature was something else entirely. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I love this giant empty Samurai armor who's straight to the slope. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Given, sort of, admits he's a late boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As Bert, he's super easy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is the Egyptian themed pyramid level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's funny how so many video games have an Egyptian level, as compared to say, three other ancient civilization. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Parts are the health refills are found [pretty] frequently. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And here's the thing: enemies respond, including those who drop health. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So you can, sort of, farm health rebels when you find an enemy that actually drops them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can kill what, goes we never, come back, kill them again, and get another health refill. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can do this several times in a row usually. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This guy is [pretty] amazing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a cute looking cat that sort of sins demon caps at you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Not that long ago, a Japanese prototype was discovered of the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It exists [only] in private hands. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But since then, people have realized it's when the bosses were more clearly based on copyrighted or movies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And these were changed for the actual U.S. release. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The cat, for example, may have been based on Gremlins. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The kittens actually look like Gremlins and the big cat has like that distinctive white stripe on its head. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This guy is great punk rocker. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I don't want to get too pretentious here and called "Monster Party", a postmodern game or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are some moments that sort of turn video game conventions onto their head. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like the dead boss we saw earlier, are these guys - dancing zombies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And they stand there and don't attack you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can kill them if you want, but they just keep coming back to life, so to speak. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So what do you do? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, absolutely nothing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 After a minute or so of uninterrupted dancing, they'll just collapse and you beat the boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's rather a peaceful looking watermelon seems out of place. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it does have this rather marvelous enemy - a small fish disguising itself as a shark. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This guy is a thinly disguised take on by margin, the giant stone warrior from the <NINETEEN-SIXTIES::1960s> monster movies. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The next level is the most despised in the game, a haunted house, and it's just one of those big old confusing mazes, with doors that work through around all over the place. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now once you've actually figured out the correct path take it's actually quite easy, but that awful wind sound effect will drive you crazy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There's [only] one boss on this level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But good Lord, what, sort of, madness is this? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It turns out the actual boss you have to kill is one of the faces. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The rest are, sort of, like all harmless fakes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the way they blend in with a background would not move they make some hard to actually find. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is gonna be about one of the freakiest looking video game boss battles ever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The penultimate level is vertical and filled with some terrible puns. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like we have the Elephant Man and the umpire as opposed to a vampire. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first boss is, of course, a caterpillar named Royce, who rolls himself into a ball and charges at you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's [pretty] funny. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Rolls Royce. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Then it's the Grim Reaper himself. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like so many other bosses, he's stationary, and you kill him by batting stuff back at him. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As a bird though, you can just fly up and laser up to death. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the game does a major screw up with this boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 After fighting the second Boston, red lever, contain the key needed to edit the level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But when you get to the third boss (which is actually spider number two; he even has a number two on his abdomen) when you kill him he lose the key which is a [pretty] terrible thing to do as a player. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The last level takes him to more familiar a bit beauty territory - castle, clouds, and that sort of crap. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But still the bosses are freaky. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Look at those eyes staring at you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And no one is missing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Flying Dragon here is actually the puppet boss because it is totally ride your ass. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't know of any smart way to fight them other than the, sort of, you know stocking up on health and then, sort of, crossing your fingers and hope that you kill him before he kills you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Mark soup! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 How do we know Mark's name? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This guy appears like a giant modified Pharaoh hit on a tiny body. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so last week we reached the end of our journey. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Each! now we get to see his full face. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This kind of reminds me of something I've seen before like an old silent movie or something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It looks, sort of, like the face of Mark and metropolis, but I don't think that's what I'm thinking of. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I can't quite figure out what he reminds me of. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 He's going to be either easy or long and difficult thing on how often is a big spot opens up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Okay, so once you defeated him, we now get to reward ourselves with the utterly creepy and batshit insane ending. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Whoa! So how old is Mark supposed to be again? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A strange thing to give a young boy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then it gets worse. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Holy crap! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I can't really think of very many other video game endings from me or the eight the era there why it is disturbing is this one. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It, sort of, implies that mark is trapped in like a "Groundhog Day"-like eternal loop before death. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And no, I know that "Monster Party" is not definitely speaking of great game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Much the platforming parts are [pretty] routine and uninspired. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it's just so weird and different I can't help but kind of like it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, it's really much more creative than all the other terrible crap man I was putting out at this time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I really kind of wonder why this Japanese release was canceled. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's not really a very hard game to find. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And people sometimes refer to as an obscure game, but it seems to be put out in [pretty] big numbers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And you can get copies [pretty] cheap. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So if you ever play this game, I would definitely recommend looking at it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 California Games 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Epyx | Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Milton Bradley 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 How wonderful another Epyx Computer Game ported to the N.E.S. fi Rare. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You might be aware that I am not fond of this series. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And it seems like we've already seen so many of these "Winter Games", "World Games", "Summer Games", "California Games". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Yes, we already Covered "California Games" on the Sega Master System. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That was way back in "Chronsega Episode <SEVEN::7>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So if you don't watch the 'Chronsega' videos (or just have a bad memory like me) this is a collection of several little games that revolve around the, sort of, fun activities that we do out here in California, supposedly, like skateboarding, rollerskating, Frisbee and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Though the game can't actually use the word 'Frisbee' since that is a registered trademark. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game is notable for the spectacular number of real life companies that appear as sponsors in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Op, Kawasaki, Santa Cruz skateboards, Casio, and Milton Bradley, who of course, was the actual publisher of this game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They were also the ones who published the N.E.S. version of "World Games", which was also ported by Rare. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As I've bitched about before, while covering other Epyx Games or and stuff like "Skate or Die!". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The main issue here is trying to figure out how the controls work and how the timing of the controls work. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These games have weird overly complicated and tricky to use controls games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Even if you know what the buttons do, you'll have to spend some time figuring out the exact timing of the button presses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So even if you know that you have to say hit the A button and the left button to a particular trick, you'll still fall down a bunch of times trying to discover exactly when you need to hit those buttons in order to successfully perform the trick. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now of course, this is not really a requIrement An Sports Games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Plenty of games from Excitebike to "Punch-Out" to "Tecmo Bowl", have these really easy-to-use intuitive controls. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The design philosophy behind "California Games" is the exact opposite of that those games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Like We covered the Master System version earlier. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It didn't really look that much better than this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nor did it play any better. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Rare here certainly not try to improve "California Games", as far as I can tell. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, I'm sure this cart sold [pretty] well since it was a huge hit on computers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But I think we can, sort of, safely sweep this one under the rug now. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the good news is, this is the very last one of these games on the N.E.S., as far as I know. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> July ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Moving on to July, we have a decent selection of titles. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nothing too crazy - [pretty] cool game from Capcom, a Beat-'em-Up, couple R.P.G.s. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Let's take a look! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 13 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, this is a bit of a confusing title screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is a six Damon Jaleco's 'Moero!!' series, though there's that one character that looks, sort of, like a three. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The title is actually "Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu" (or 'numeral Pro Baseball'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is a third 'Morel' Baseball Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first two were from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987> <EIGHTY-EIGHT::'88>, respectively. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And they were released in the U.S. as "Bases Loaded". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This game was not released in the U.S. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Basis load three" was based on the fourth 'neural Pro Yakou' game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the FamiCom game with I have posted on the 'Chrontendo' blog states that this game actually was "Bases Loaded three", but the author of that list was not correct. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And don't blame me because I'm actually not the one who put that list together. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though I am, of course, often confused in my own special way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, did I mention that the game uses the players bio rhythms? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now if you don't know what a bio rhythm is, then congratulations, you were probably not alive in the <SEVENTIES::'70s> (though why bio rhythms are turning up in a video game in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> is anybody's guess). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 By the way, the biorhythm theory was invented by a statement from Roy's crazy buddy Wilhelm pleace, who also theorized people's mental problems came from their nose, and was an avid supporter of cocaine for medical purposes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Those of you familiar with the 'Bases Loaded' series will recognize that Jaleco and developer Tose, kind of switch things up a bit here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Instead of doing the old behind-the-pitcher view from the first two games, we now have this odd oblique angle, which makes the pitching mound look hilariously close to the batter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Like most Baseball Games, from AlaFamiCom, you're going to hit an extraordinary number of foul balls. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You also have that same damn annoying wind and music constantly playing in the background. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There are the usual problems that when the C.P.U. hits a ball, you can't see your outfielders until the ball is already all the way out there. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it's really hard to get it in place to catch the ball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Naturally, the C.P.U.s outfielders will have no problem with this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I'm not sure why Jaleco didn't release this in the U.S. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though actually Jaleco seemed on the verge of actually abandoning this series in the U.S. for a while. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Bases Loaded to" come out in <NINETEEN-NINETY::1990>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But "NUMBER-THREE::#3" wasn't released until <NINETEEN-NINETY-THREE::1993>, which was obviously [pretty] near the end of the system's lifespan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway as this one not coming out in the U.S. it's not really a huge loss. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Igo-Shinan 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 14 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hect 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hect 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Second game of July is "Igo-Shinan", from Hector, a.k.a. Hect. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I've noticed all the Hector games have that thing in the upper left corner. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Not sure why. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well "Igo-Shinan" is another Igo Game with an unpleasant droning soundtrack. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 'Igo-Shinan' means 'Igo-Instruction'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So this is a game that teaches you how to play Igo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There's a bunch of options hear which control how much guidance the game gives you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You'll see what I mean in just a second. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Go is a strategic Board Game from the days of ancient China. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In Japan, it's often called Igo for some damn reason. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The object is to surround your opponent's pieces in order to capture them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Players alternate placing pieces on the board is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first FamiCom Go Game was from Bulletproof Software in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was supposedly the [only] video game that Nintendo President, Hiroshi Yamauchi, ever played. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now there was another Go Game from Namco, released in March <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But "Igo-Shinan" must become [pretty] popular. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Since they released a sequel for about once a year, it became like the main Ico series on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As you can see, the computer gives you hints. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It offers two choices one optimal and one not so optimal. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can also set it to offer you up to five choices or even zero, which is basically just playing Go against the computer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I suppose the computer giving me hints is the [only] way that I could possibly beat the C.P.U. since I know nothing of Go strategy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Even with the hints hover, the C.P.U. did completely kick my butt. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oh, well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Still, it's a good idea. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, the idea of just playing a Board Game against a computer is, sort of, silly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But this actually kind of makes sense - you know, a video game that teaches you the strategy of playing the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I don't know how helpful this really was when it comes to learning how to be a good Go player, but at least it seems like a reasonable effort. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dragon Ninja 🇯🇵 // "Bad Dudes" 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 14 🇯🇵 // 1990 July [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East | Sakata SAS 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 From Namco we have "Dragon Ninja" another game with no music whatsoever during the intro. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nap goes on a bit of a roll lately with releases coming out quite frequently. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We actually have another Namco game released exactly one week after "Dragon Ninja". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Dragon Ninja" did receive the U.S. release and I'm sure you recognize this screen right here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yeah, Data East published it in the U.S. as "Bad Dudes" again with an eerily silent titled screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The U.S. version chose to drop the music in place of this annoying, sort of, typing sound effect. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I have no idea who this guy is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But he utters one of the most iconic lines and peak bit gaming. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yes, I am a bad enough dude... I hope. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Bad Dudes" does a single-plane Beat-'em-Up in the pre-"Renegade" tradition. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It reminds me a lot of rooms "Vigilante". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You have an attack button, a jump button. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The attack button does proves quite a few different results like a low kick, high kick, punch, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And you can use both buttons together do like the spinning kick. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Bad Dudes" was originally Arcade Game from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You can see the New Yorker Hotel in the background. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I stayed there once. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The U.S. Arcade version was given the name "Bad Dudes versus the Dragon Ninja", but this was a course shortened for the N.E.S. game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If anything, the arcades intro is even better. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's not just 'the president' but 'President Ronnie'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Arcade and home versions are actually quite similar, but obviously the original looks quite a bit nicer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The truck is moving here; it's parked in the N.E.S. version. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And carnac is the first boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's what a nice call back to an earlier data use game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There was some decent use of multi-player and scrolling. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is certainly without't the best or most popular Beat-'em-Up at its time but in the cheesy plot give it a certain amount of appeal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the N.E.S. version is much more well-known but it's not quite the game of the Arcade "Bad Dudes" is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's harder in, um, some ways. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the first.lTvel those black, uh, aood ninjas are M.S.X. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Y ften appear at the edge of the screen and then very quickly toss a throwing star at you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These guys were a bit slower on the Arcade version and he had more time to react. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Carnauba is a bit tougher as well. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your attacks have virtually no range, so you need to be almost touching him when you throw a punch if you want to connect. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He seems also maybe a little faster and less predictable. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The great I'm bad after being a boss is retained from the Arcade Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Level <TWO::2> is probably the highlight first of all take place on top of the moving big rig. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 No explanation for this as given or needed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You're just fighting ninjas on an <eighteen::18> Wheeler. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This level is a bit easier since then you just have to jump up from the ground so you can position yourself to hit them as they're in mid-jump and thus helpless. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also the "Castlevania"-inspired music is really cool. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The truck actually says 'Dudes' on it. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is Is your truck? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 To the "Bad Dudes" on a trucking company? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This boss can be defeated in a somewhat cheesy way - standing on the truck and is really hitting him as he jumps up over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now I'd like to be able to report that "Bad Dudes" is a classic on level of "Contra" or a "Ninja Gaiden" but actually, it's [pretty] mediocre. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Level Design is [pretty] boring; your most is walking around on flat surfaces, and occasionally need to like jump up or down one level or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh, here's the sewer level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This boss is [pretty] easy if you have a nunchucks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's [only] two weapons in the entire game nunchucks and the dagger. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Stick with the nunchucks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Level four look like it's ripped straight out of "Contra". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The level design is much simpler than in "Contra", though. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's [pretty] much like I said just walking in a straight line along the ground. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The next level is a rehash of Level <TWO::2>, but now it's on a train. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The music is even the same. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 After this we have the bosses underground headquarters. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 All the levels look, sort of, boring have [pretty] limited color palettes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Mean they'll be okay if the game itself or more interesting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But aside from the truck and the train stages, there's really nothing going on visually. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Even worse, the enemies are the same in each stage. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Very few new enemies are introduced throughout the game... even on the last level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's just the same old ninjas we've been seeing over and over again. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Every once in a while you'll see something different like the mass of ninjas waiting for you here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But really "Bad Dudes" is [pretty] repetitive. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, so finally reached this elevator and outcomes this guy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Bad Dudes" ends with a boss Rush. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You face each boss from the earlier levels though in greatly weakened form. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This guy's a piece of cake. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You can take quite a few hits before dying and there's definitely health refills and each level. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And once you are not alive, so you have to roll continues. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I have never played the game until now. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And on this last level, I was a couple punches away from killing the final boss the first time I encountered him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I think the trick to "Bad Dudes" is to get the nunchucks and don't die before you lose them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So you actually have them when you fight the bosses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you have the nunchucks and the final boss is like laughably easy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 After killing the 'Dragon Ninja', the helicopter lands and out jumps the president. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So who landed the helicopter? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The president? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Did he overpower the pilot or something? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Then the pres (who resembles a Bush in this case since Ronnie was out of office at nine) offers you a hamburger because hanging out with George Bush is [pretty] much its own reward. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So "Bad Dudes" not a terrible game, but just one of those teams, sort of, behind the times the post-"Double Dragon" and "River State Ransom" world. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That weren't for the title and the funny bits of dialogue I am [pretty] sure nobody would remember this game today. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 White Lion Densetsu 🇯🇵 // Ghost Lion 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 14 🇯🇵 // 1992 October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Kemco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, we've got a few R.P.G.s today, so let's start with this one from Kemco, "White Lion Densetsu". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There we seen the titular white lion and some pyramids in the background. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Nowadays people always talk about Elio no J.R.P.G.s came out in the U.S. back then. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But a few [pretty] obscure title did get U.S. releases and this is one of them, under the name "Legend of the Ghost Lion". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The intro describes the lion as quote-unquote 'a white lion'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 White was changed in the actual title, I don't know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Maria grabs a sphere and decides to find her parents. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, how old is this kid? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there is the ghost of the dead guy trapped in the sphere? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's [pretty] odd. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Little child dry your crying eyes and go out and stab some s---. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That seems to be, sort of, the main plot of this game here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And what's going on here? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 She lives in a dungeon? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Anyway, white lion does things a little differently. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your stats are now described as hope, Courage, and dreams (or rather just 'dream'). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Collectively, these stats are known as 'bigger'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And you also have a wood key needed to open the door. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's kind of weird that she lives in a dungeon and is locked herself into this empty room. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However, she immediately falls off her bridge and is swept away. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And she awakens in this land of dreams. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I like to think this whole game is like a hosted nation as she's drowning. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Kind of like that was the idea behind that Chopin game that came out a couple years ago, I believe. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As I mentioned, "White Lion Densetsu" a, sort of, obscure. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Doesn't even have a Japanese Wikipedia page. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I couldn't find many sources for embro about this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But one thing I do know; this was actually based on a movie from either <EIGHTY-EIGHT::'88> or <EIGHTY-NINE::'89> called "pyramid Oh no konata neat: White Lion Densetsu". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game's title screen was based on the imagery from posters it seems, and we can see a couple of the game's characters in the poster art. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now from this info, you would guess the movie took place in Africa, but I couldn't find anything on this movie online. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm quite curious to know if the game follows the plot of the movie at all. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, the game has fairies, werewolves, and orcs, and stuff. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And based on what I'm seeing on the posters, I just can't believe the movie is anything like the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So if anybody out there has a video from the movie or seen it, I guess let me know. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So "ghost line" is [pretty] eccentric. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One way in which it is eccentric is a combat. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It has its own unique and [pretty] annoying Take on army combat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You have weapons (you start off with a dagger) but you don't equip them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Rather weapons are used in combat as items. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So to attack you hit fight, tools, then select your weapon, and you need to do this every single battle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In other odd touch, whereas most R.P.G. battles are [pretty] abstract here every time it indicates you we see the character winson pain. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this is like some young girl getting stabbed by an orc with a spear or something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's a little disturbing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "White Lion..." has [only] one character and party sort of. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You see you can employ summons in this game, so well before "Final Fantasy" had summons who really are in the "White Lion Densetsu". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In another "Final Fantasy"-related coincidence, there is an MA called efreet or if fleet as the game actually calls them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But during battle you can call summons to fight alongside you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's possible to summon multiple creatures during the same battle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, for the boss battles is actually a good idea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "White Lion..." [pretty] much copies the structure of 'Dragon Quest' and "Final Fantasy" wholesale. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You alternate Between villages and dungeons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first talent is called rather stupidly 'Bread'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can buy bread here, by the way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The citizens here are complaining about a nearby Goblin and some magic dust that he's stolen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So you head on over to the nearest dungeon and sure enough, there is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's a good example of using the summit's. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Use the lamp and Tawana will appear your main magical summon. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is go with offensive spells like bomb and status spells like dark or a little later sleep. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When the summons do spells or fight it drains their power and they disappear in their power is down to zero. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Another odd thing: after battles you get money, a.k.a. rubies, but no experience. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So no experience then how do you get more powerful? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, your level (or 'Hope', as it's called) is increased by finding hope fragments. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Each one raise your Hope, which in turn raises your Courage (a.k.a. Hit Points) and dream (a.k.a. Magic Points). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And I believe you also have some invisible stats like some kind of Attack stat. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Since you seem to get stronger As your home increases. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Of course, you also find or buy better weapons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The games debt to "Final Fantasy" is [pretty] obvious here as certain N.P.C. sprites are [pretty] much directly copied in the first "Final Fantasy" game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The read made here is rather blatant. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Other graphics like the chest and the stairs are again [pretty] much taken directly from earlier games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now as I mentioned, there is no equipment, per se. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's no armor or accessories, just items is bone combat. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Aside from weapons, you have a few other offensive items. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like there's some buff items, and there's the blue ring which increases defense, bred which heals you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And amazingly, there is no healing magic as far as I can tell. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm [pretty] sure that the [only] way to heal other than visiting one of those very springs (that lake where the fairies hang out there, usually found in villages) is by using the bread items. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And bread restores [only] <fifty::50> points of Courage. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So later in the game, you didn't use a whole lot of bread to fully restore your health. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I'm sure this gets really annoying as your Courage gets higher and you need to carry around tons and tons of bricks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So "White Lion Densetsu" is an odd combination of cool for the elements and terrible old-fashioned elements. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the summon to basically allow you to customize your party each battle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's a total of <eleven::11> summons. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Some use magic, others have strong attacks, and others are good at defending. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The whole system have no experience or equippable items makes the game [pretty] unique. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Since the hope crystals are found [only] certain set points in the game, you can't grind increase your strength. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 On the negative side, the game is [pretty] user unfriendly, especially the interface. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Form a single attack, you need to hit the button way too many times. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We select fight, tools, from the weapon, then choose the enemy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's a total of four button presses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there's three more to actually get past the screens that explain that you're actually attacking the enemy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And each time enemy attacks you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's two more button presses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And when you actually win the battle, there's two more button presses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So that's about <eleven::11> button presses for a one round battle without using a summons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And if the battle lasts more than one round, then, of course, the number of button presses increases. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's a lot of buttons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Seeing the World Map is [pretty] big, two large continents and a couple of small islands. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The overworld is definitely more interesting than that a "Phantasy Start to". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Eventually you encounter some pyramids, and the last battle is against the white line himself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Overall, it's a surprisingly decent game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If nothing else, the way it, sort of, mixes up the traditional J.R.P.G. formula makes it a unique game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Willow 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 18 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Capcom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Capcom 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, folks, Capcom game alert: it's "Willow". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As you could imagine, this did get a U.S. release rather quickly as a matter of fact, in December of <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You'd have to, sort of, think that Capcom loves to do some crazy ass custom chips and "Willow", just based on how great it looks and sounds. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And that's some really good music. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 No as far as I can tell, the will cartridge contains nothing special, just the old MMC one memory mapper. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's basically got the same guts as "Legend or the White Lion". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess it's just Capcom artistry at work. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Because I'd say that we'll have some of the very best presentation we've seen so far on this console. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Willow" doesn't exactly fit precisely into a genre. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Most folks would call the "...Zelda" clone. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And it is very inspired by "...Zelda" but it also throws in some straight up R.P.G. stuff. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You get Experience Points which raise your level and your stats. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it's essentially "...Zelda", sort of, nudged over a few notches and the R.P.G. direction. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I'm sure you all know this, but "Willow" is, at least in theory, based on the <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988> movie directed by Ron Howard. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The story was originally conceived by George Lucas, who produced the movie with his frequent co-conspirator Joe Johnson. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Johnson, by the way, had a [pretty] decent career directing, sort of, lame movies, like "Jurassic Park three" and that recent Wolf Man movie. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The new Captain America movie is probably his most financially successful effort. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Ron Howard was on a huge streak as well in the <EIGHTIES::'80s>, having recently directed "Splash" and "Cocoon" and. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That was the dawn Amaechi breakdancing movie. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And despite the huge amount of hype leading up to "Willow"s release, it was not really the Smash Hit it was expected to be, at least compared to the previous Lucas produced stuff like 'Star Wars' and 'Indiana Jones'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Who's also a bit of a critical flop and earned Lucas his first Golden Raspberry nomination. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Willow" along with "Howard the Duck" was, sort of, the those were the first films to kind of tarnish Lucas's reputation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It did receive a few different video game adaptations. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There was a [pretty] much worthless Computer Game from MindScape in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This was just a series of minigames based around scene from the movie, some of which were literally guessing games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Then came along Macau Calm with two 'Willow' games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The "Willow" Arcade Game was a [pretty] awesome side-scrolling Action Game in the host-"Ghost Goblins" name. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The Arcade "Willow" all the film [pretty] closely and took great pains to make the characters resemble their real life counterparts. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A number of teams will be worth faithfully depicted in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And while it's not kept coms best Arcade Game of the year (that would probably be "Strider") it was [pretty] impressive. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 By <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, Capcom learn that Arcade Games and console games were two completely different beasts. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And that rather try to cram in an Arcade Game onto the N.E.S. they produced two different games with the same title. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Tecmo had been doing this with games like "Ninja Gaiden". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Capcom already done "Bionic Commando" and later "Strider". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Nintendo Entertainment System "Willow" doesn't resemble the Arcade "Willow" in the slightest. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Hardcore gaming one-on-one speculates, but it actually started life as a completely unrelated game, and then had the "Willow" license added on sometime during development. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That is quite possible. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Even though "Willow" features a lot of the characters in the movie, the game does not follow these plot whatsoever. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game begins in "Willow"s home village. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here you will talk to the N.P.C.s, find a guy who gives you a sword, and then head on out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the forest to be attacked by monsters naturally. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Battle play out much like in "...Zelda". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Monsters appear on screen, and then you poke them with your sword until they die. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For each monster you defeat the Experience Points. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once you have enough you'll Level Up and your Hit Points and Magic Points will go up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Willow" is I'd say far more linear than "...Zelda". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The world, sort of, takes place in a series of interconnected screens much like "...Zelda" but everything isn't just laid out in a big rectangle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The world is divided into like various Sub areas like towns, forests, caves, et cetera. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And these are connected by paths. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We're able to backtrack and even have, sort of, something, sort of, like a teleportation skill later in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it's not quite like "...Zelda" reconfirming to walk from one end of the world to the other in a matter of minutes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I suppose that much like "...Zelda" you have two major goals in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One of them is to simply keep traveling forward, which involves getting past various roadblocks by finding special items, talking to N.P.C.s, and defeating the occasional boss. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here's one such boss here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, I don't want to criticize "Willow" probing easy bosses, but many of the bosses and "Willow" are quite easy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The most common attack type is simply throwing some sort of projectile at you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you have the right shield, you can simply deflect these. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The most important thing here is the timing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your shield will not deflect if you are still in the middle of your attack swing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So there is a little window where your swing appears to be complete, but you're still vulnerable. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So patience is important these battles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Most bosses will yield some kind of item or helpful magic Words. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And often the path to the next area is unlocked. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The second major objective is to find better weapons and shields. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These are often tucked away in treasure chest in the corners of dungeons or forests. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Sometimes N.P.C.s will give them to you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And they all have very vo gaming names like flame sword, Dragon Sword, Kaiser sword... which makes me wonder, 'what is this Japanese fascination with the word 'Kaiser'?'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When how many video games have a Kaiser sword or something in them? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We saw in "Final Fantasy" there was the Kaiser knuckle. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The kinds of resort is not a real thing right? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well without getting the newest and fancy weapons and shields, you will probably be toast in the next boss fight. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also, there is magic, which is a probably healing is the most useful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there are various Quest Items that go into your inventory and [pretty] much do their, sort of, thing automatically. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So you never really pay attention to the inventory items. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now some enemies are really freaking annoying, forcing the bosses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like the skeletons with the shields that reflect or block most of your attacks. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These remind me a lot of those guys in "...Zelda <TWO::II>...". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And I just hate them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You were supposed to do a sword thrust as they attack you and they have their shield down. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But still, they hit their shield so many times they just drive me crazy. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and these guys, they pop out of the water, hit you, then come out of their shells, and send projectiles at you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then they'll fly you again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And these guys and most enemies do quite a bit of damage to you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 As you can see them a [pretty] substantial number of Hit Points, but they dropped down really quickly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Here's an example of a roadblock. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In the game and to get an item which allows you to breathe underwater before you can pass this point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Most of the N.P.C.s are based on characters from the movie. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Need to transform this guy back into his human form. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 However, you must be at Level <Thirteen::13> to do this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This actually reproduces a scene from the movie, which do a lot of attention at the time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Industrial lights and magic use computer graphics to recreate one of the first examples of the popular morphing special effect. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is a few years before "Terminator two". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This blew people's minds back then. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Willow" was released in the middle of like a CGI revolution movies. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Within a few years, we have the fully CGI living creatures in "Jurassic Park". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As mentioned, "Willow" really shines in the aesthetics department. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At times backgrounds are animated, the music is very impressive, and there's just so much detail that the game really, sort of, comes to life. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here, for example, as you climb the tower, you can see the floors you've already climbed below you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then these torches, sort of, light up as you move along. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And in some ways, "Willow" seems to be imitating not "The Legend of Zelda", but looking forward to "Link to the Past". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That you these soft colors and almost tipping a pastel fill. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Willow" even swings his sword much like link doesn't that game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game's world "Willow" is also laid out much like "Link to the Past", rather than the first "...Zelda" game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Willow" was promoted reasonably well by Nintendo. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It ended up with articles and three consecutive issues of 'Nintendo Power' - a preview and then to detailed guides. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As I mentioned, most of the magic and special items are really not that useful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But there are a few exceptions. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And once you obtain the a.k.a. arena, you can summon your buddy poke will come along and pick you up and then drop you off at various locations throughout the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is useful for backtracking and filling up your health and magic before entering a castle or something. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, you sometimes need to use magic to get past a certain point. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 These horrifying looking mouths in the ground will start attacking you and the [only] way to get safely across is to transform into a monster than they'll ignore you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As you approach the game's end you need to enter a couple capsules, each with a couple bosses. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This guy is super easy if you have the right sort. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And you'll remember this dude from the movie I'm sure. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He traps you and takes your magical stone thinking. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also the Val Kilmer characters imprisoned in the jail with you he as well here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He's a major character and believe it barely appears in the game is all. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The same thing with the baby that's going to save the world. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Will [only] encounters or once in the entire game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The music when you reach the final castle is quite amazing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I guess they used overtones or something to create that voice you can hear in the background. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But all the music here is really good and sometimes a little eerie. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's by her Rumi fajita, who asked him the music for the Yes version of "Strider" and some of the "Mega Man <THREE::3>" music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, you can see the full assortment of swords and shields collected. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game also does try to attempt to a tie up a couple of loose ends. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Val Kilmer and daughter the main villain fall in love here, like they do in the movie. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Even fight these skulls and face dude. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And you also had to transform that guy back into human form once you reach Level <Thirteen::13>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But I'm [pretty] sure you also have to reach at least Level <Fourteen::14> to beat the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Since the final boss that morta can [only] be defeated using a particular magic spell. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And if you are below Level <Fourteen::14>, you simply will run out of magic before she's defeated. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And once you do this and you get the crest of the Spirit, you can actually attack her using her sword. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 She's [pretty] easy to beat in the second half of the boss battle, and she begs for mercy funnily enough. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yet of course, "Willow" is a cold blooded killer and refuses to listen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And since this is not a Konami game, or castle does not explode at the end. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So overall, "Willow" is a [pretty] fantastic game and one that shows just what Capcom was capable of. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And we've had two 'Mega Man's "Bionic Commando", and now "Willow". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And up ahead, there was the Capcom 'Disney' games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Capcom was entering some sort of Golden Age around this point. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I wouldn't put "Willow" quite on the same level as a "Mega Man <TWO::2>". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it is one of the best Action Adventure Games on the internet. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And by today's standards can be a bit repetitive. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this, sort of, long a speed run takes about an hour and a half. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But still I would highly recommend it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hissatsu Doujou Yaburi 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 18 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sigma 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay folks here we have something called "Hissatsu Doujou Yaburi". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What's going on this game? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well, first of all, you know what they say about laws and sausages. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You don't want to know how they're made? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, the same is true for 'Chrontendo', [only] the typical episode usually involves a whole lot more pig awful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A little secret: Despite this thing being called 'Chrontendo', the games in each episode are not really played or edited in chronological order. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 In the case of today's episode, I played a game we're going to see very shortly called "Tenkaichi Bushi Keru Nagūru" well before "Hissatsu Doujou Yaburi", I guess because the other game somehow looked less terribleness. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And in the "Tenkaichi..." segment, I marvel at how the game is basically a fighting R.P.G. hybrid, and how 'Oh, isn't that crazy? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The guys who made this game thought up mashing together Fighting Games in R.P.G. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's nothing else "Tenkaichi..." was a unique idea.'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well, imagine my chagrin loading up "Hissatsu Doujou Yaburi" and discovering that it is also a Fighting Game R.P.G. hybrid. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The one major difference is that this is using a horizontal side-scrolling world rather than a top-down one. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the basic underlying premise is the same. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Based just on the cover art, you would assume that this thing was licensed from an economy or toy line or something. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And as far as I can tell, it's not. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm [pretty] sure there are no sequels or anything like that either. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The publisher is sigma. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Prior to They had some Arcade Games under their belt. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This was our first FamiCom title. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They released a couple more later head worlds a few Game Boy games and a few other things - nothing of any importance. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You may be seen a Genesis game called "Shadow Blasters". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So how is "Hissatsu Doujou Yaburi"? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, what do you think? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, take a look. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Does this really look like a game that you want to play? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is anyone out there thinking? 'Yeah, this looks fantastic; I bet it's an undiscovered gem on the FamiCom.'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Probably not. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This, sort of, thing is, you know, [pretty] terrible. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Controls are unresponsive, your character moves slowly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Even turning around the face the other direction takes like one second. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So this is not exactly "Street Fighter <TWO::II> Turbo". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As you walk around, you encounter various guys who want to fight you. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You get some kind of experience which you can redeem to make yourself more powerful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There are also these buildings venture where there's some kind of tournament going on and you have to defeat a bunch of guys in a row. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Looking at this now, I realized that we did have some sort of quasi-R.P.G. Fighting Games earlier in the system. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There were a few side-scrolling Fighting Games the plot like Culture Brains here uno kin games. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So maybe "Tenkaichi..." is not as original as I thought. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Well anyway, moving along. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium Heisei Gannenhan 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Winkysoft 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh Lord, why another Baseball Game already? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Eight days after "she Maru pro yaku" we have a new entry in a another Baseball series Taito's "Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium..." developed by Winky saw. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 All admit this title sequence is [pretty] stylish. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The first game came out not that long ago in June <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-EIGHT::1988>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We made or had a follow-up - more of an update than sequel. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And now we have what is I suppose the true sequel "Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium Heisei Gannenhan". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The 'Heisei Gannenhan' means 'first year of the Heisei era'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In Japan a new named arrow starts with each new Emperor. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989> the long reign of Emperor Showa died (in the West, we usually refer to him as Hirohito) and his son Akihito assumed the throne. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The new Emperor's Emperor name was Heisei, meaning 'peace everywhere'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Unfortunately, the <NINETIES::'90s> and <TWO-THOUSANDS::2000s> were a troubled time for Japan as the economy crashed and the country became overrun by otaku who never leave their bedrooms. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the Heisei was at least a good time for Japanese video game companies... at least for a little while. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So anyway, this (much like the first game) is a bit of a Baseball Simulation Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's lots of stats, you can customize your team's. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Mechanically it plays very similar to the 'Malarial Pro Yakou' games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 When I covered the first game of theories I mentioned that the most interesting thing about it was a really cool cover illustration. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The same is true here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Even though this time we actually have like a neat <THREE::3>-D sculptural photo. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The sequel also usable sculptures. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But in the Super FamiCom era, the covers became really ugly and dumb looking. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I guess we are, sort of, seeing the glory days on the series right here, at least in terms of cover art. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So anyway, moving right along. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tenkaichi Bushi Keru Nagūru 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Game Studio 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So "White Lion..." was a weird R.P.G. and here's another from Namco. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's "Tenkaichi Bushi Keru Nagūru" (or 'greatest warrior on earth kickin punch', as demonstrated by all that kicking and punching in that game logo). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And "Tenkaichi Bushi..." is (are you ready for this?) a Fighting Game R.P.G. more or less. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It was developed by close Namco allies Game Studio, the company founded by Massimo boo endo, creator of "Xevious" after he left Namco. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So I mean, a Fighting Game R.P.G. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Why not? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We saw a tennis R.P.G. on the P.C. Engine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So, so many options. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, the first couple options are just the fighting portion of the game - one-on-One fighting to be precise as. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You pick your character but (I know this came out well before "Street Fighter <TWO::II>" and "Mortal Kombat" and back then wasn't written in stone that Fighting Games had to have this really huge diverse roster of characters) -- but there's [only] one character here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Every one looks exactly the same except for the color of your outfit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, the characters do have different moods. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I discovered that the character I picked here has no jumping ability. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But still, the fighter mechanics are very basic as far as I can tell. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The single main player game is here so we'll do a quick overview and. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Tenkaichi Bushi..." has this large overall that you'll roam around on. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You will often encounter random fights. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your character must have some sort of underlying stats which aren't really displayed, which explains how enemies comes to mind like knock you out in one or two blows. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Dying will be sent back to the starting point. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Walking around in a field almost always starts a fight for some reason, I guess maybe with a farmer who doesn't like you walking on his field. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Though, when the game begins, you [only] have just one move - a simple punch. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also on the overworld, you will often encounter these little villages. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The villages almost look exactly the same. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And there's one guy you can fight. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And it appears that as you win battles, your Hit Points start increasing and you will eventually Game new moves. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Battles, at least at this stage, are very button mashing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The [only] thing you can do is [pretty] much just walk up to a guy and start hitting this nasty hand. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 An early goal in the game appears to be this temple. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Each time you defeat a guy at the temple, you can then challenge a new stronger fighter. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But other than that I didn't really encounter much here beyond random battles and very repetitive N.P.C.s. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Like I said, a lot of the villages have the exact same people in them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 From what I gather, this is [pretty] much what the entire game looks like. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So unfortunately, "Tenkaichi Bushi..." is [pretty] impenetrable. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm sure it gets better later as your character actually learned more moves. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But from what I played was actually sort of annoying. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Zanbei!! Pro Basket 🇯🇵 // All-Pro Basketball 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 21 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Aicom 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by VIC TOKAI 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh God! Stop it! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Seriously! this music is horrible! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And look at that crazy map of the U.S.! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What the hell happened to Michigan? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's been reduced to some skinny little peninsula. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Zanbei!! Pro Basketball" is a Basketball Game published by VIC TOKAI and developed by Aicom, who also did victimize "Amazon" and "Hoops" for delicate. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 VIC TOKAI released in the U.S. as "All-Pro Basketball". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The U.S. map is it a bit of a makeover here but it still looks like Canada has annex most of Ohio. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game doesn't use any real names of course, but in the Japanese version of the names were quite fanciful. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For the U.S. games names are changed make them more suggestive of the real life team names - like the Dallas, The Los Angeles breakers, or in the case of Seattle they just up and call them the Sonics. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So right up front, I'll just say I [pretty] much hate this game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Have you seen one very good Basketball Game for the console - Konami's "Double Dribble". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Angelicus "Hoops" was [pretty] good. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That was a half court Street Basketball Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And even Sega is weird "Basketball Nightmare" was, sort of, fun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But this, well, here's my problem. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe icom couldn't figure out how to program a Basketball Game that scrolled all the way across the court. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Because here's what they do instead. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 When the ball reaches the half court line, the game freezes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the perspective is flipped, as the entire court is rotated <ONE-HUNDRED-AND-EIGHTY-DEGREES::180°>, and the guy with the ball is moved to the other side of the court, and in the game unfreezes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And this has got to be the most awkward, confusing solution imaginable. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If you were running down, you're now running up and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 When you have the ball, it's fine because you can, sort of, see where you're being relocated. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But if you're on the fence, you're Player simply vanishes for a second and reappear somewhere else. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And of course, he is now also facing the other direction. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Now, I'm sure what time you can get used to this, but I found it really annoying to have to try to relocate my guy when he's moved every <twenty::20> seconds. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 There are a few other issues with playing against the C.P.U. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It can steal the ball very easily. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If a C.P.U. player just brushes up against you, bam, he has the ball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And then of course, also those mysterious fouls just, sort of, randomly called on you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But really, to me the deal breaker as a whole system of rotating the court. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Is just too confusing for me, you know, visually. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe it works for you but I'm going to place this near the bottom of the list of FamiCom or N.E.S. Basketball Games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Faria: Fuuin no Tsurugi 🇯🇵 // Faria: A World of Mystery & Danger! 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 21 🇯🇵 // 1991 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Game Arts 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hi-Score Media 🇯🇵 // Nexoft 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Our last game from July <TWENTY-FIRST::21> is another R.P.G. "Faria: Fuuin no Tsurugi" (or 'Faria: Sealed Sword' from Hi-Score Media work). 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The [only] other FamiCom game published by Hi-Score was "Zombie Hunter" from <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-SEVEN::1987> I believe. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This logo here is made out of the cracked orange stone that's becoming a bit of a cliche. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We've seen so many logos that look just like this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now, despite being an R.P.G. by an obscure publisher, "Faria..." somehow got a U.S. release from next oft, who I think were connected to ASCII because they published some ASCII games in the U.S. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The name of the U.S. version is "Faria: A World of Mystery & <~Adventure~::{Danger}>!". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This was developed by Game Arts, who got their start with Japanese Computer Games, such as "Thexder", and later went on to develop several popular series such as the 'Lunar' games, as well as 'Grandia' and 'citied'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So eventually, they actually did have some serious R.P.G. credit. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It might not be clear from watching this but your character is female. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is actually made perfectly clear from the FamiCom box art, but the U.S. box are totally hidden is that. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Actually the U.S. manual gives you a bit of backstory to the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So just explaining the sealed sword and all that, but does not mention anywhere that you are playing as a member of the fairer sex. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Unless you infer this from the armor illustrations, which all have no chest plates indicate the characters female. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The dragon that this guy is referring to is apparently a dragon summoned by the sealed sword. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also look at this guy's head! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It looks kind of like the prince from "kanamori damaged". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I wouldn't call "Faria..." plot heavy game but there is a bit of story here as well as various plot twists. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So it again in the typical j R.P.G. village with the Item Shops and the weapons and the Armor Shops. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There is no end but there is a hospital I guess you'd call it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Was unusual that "Faria..." seems to, sort of, combined Fantasy with Sci-Fi in a way a little bit different than most other R.P.G.s at this time. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, yeah, you have the swords and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But there seems to be a bit of modern technology such as electric lights which require batteries or the magic glasses which look vaguely steampunky as depicted in the U.S. manual. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Faria..." is an Action R.P.G. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You have random and very frequent battles, but they take place on this little battlefield, where you need to run around and stab them. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game does look a few things directly from "...Zelda", but it feels a bit sore like outcomes "Ys". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In factoring the in credit to senior character looks a lot like although from the 'Ys' games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The first order of business is to make your way to the first castle and ask the King about his kidnapped daughter, naturally. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 He then gives you a picture of her and you see that she looks like a caterpillar which is [pretty] weird. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So he head out, start looking around for clues, you know, kill enemies, and try to Level Up, and get some money to buy better equipment. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 However you Level Up [pretty] darn slowly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I finally reached Level <Two::2> here which benami a whopping two additional Hit Points. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I needed to kill about <forty::40> monsters in order to reach Level <Two::2>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Oh look, I found the Princess! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 That was really weird. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Eventually make your way to the Tower of guild to recruit some sort of magical dude, he. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The towers are much like the dungeons in "The Legend of Zelda". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They're a maze-like series of interconnected rooms. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Often monsters will appear in the girl be locked up, kill all the monsters. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Toss them some fake walls which can be destroyed, statues to push around, and you get a [pretty] decent "...Zelda" light experience. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Though "Faria..." is a bit more sadistic than "...Zelda". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The towers are much larger in our navigate. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In fact, the first one is two floors, each floor having an eight by eight grid. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it's actually about twice as big as the final "...Zelda" dungeon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, so at this point when playing I wanted to show a bit more the game but didn't really want to do all the brightening required. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I used to password cheat that leveled me the hell up. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Playing the game yourself without this cheat is gonna be much harder than the peers here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Just like "...Zelda" you can acquire errors. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Also there are all kinds of weapons I have like a bombs and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Normally wouldn't get all this stuff until much later in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The Princess turns out to be a fairy of some sort, but she looks like a butterfly so I guess that explains the whole caterpillar bit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You return to the King and you get some dialogue, which makes you just a bit suspicious of the Princess. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Maybe there's something going on here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 At this point, the U.S. version, you would finally know that you actually are playing a female character and possibly get really confused. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The King had promised the person rescue the Princess would marry her. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it turns out you're actually more of the Kings type. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now the plot here actually kind of goes off the rails. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Instead, the King throws a party and feeds the townspeople caviar, which turns out to have been poisoned. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the King informed us that he bought the caviar from a mysterious masked man. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now folks don't ever buy luxury food items from them please stranger who is concealing their identity? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And that just makes no sense at all. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Are there less shady sources of caviar in this Kingdom? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Okay, who save all the poisoned townspeople we need to find the antidote, which is in some town across the quote-unquote "ocean". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Pirate ship to take you there and it turns out the ocean is really not that big. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This always blocks the path right here so you can never go and check out those calves that are wandering around. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If the huge towers were not bad enough, "Faria..." makes you go through caves that are literally pitch black. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yes, seriously, check this out. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the game makes you do this on multiple occasions. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And you have to buy a flashlight in order to see anything at all. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And the flashlight is powered by batteries, which die after a while. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So you get stuck in complete darkness if you run out of batteries. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Faria..." definitely has some old-school R.P.G. status into it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And then there's stuff like this. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 If a monster hits you will probably not be are one of those neural paths and you'll fall one floor down. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The boss who was a rather silly looking scissor monster. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Without all the bombs I have, he would be much, much, much harder. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once you defeated him, you get this magic item which allows you to repair a broken bridge that was hindering your progress. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As I mentioned, people sometimes refer to stuff like "Monster Party" as obscure games, but "Faria..." actually really is [pretty] obscure. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 A quick check on eBay shows people asking about <FORTY::$40> to <SIXTY-DOLLARS::$60> for the cart [only]. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This isn't the case in Japan, I guess. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It must be [pretty] common since the complete game and nice looking box goes for around $11. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As mentioned, the developer Game Arts went on to make some big name games later. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But another name that is actually quite important you might notice in the credits is Akihiko Yoshida as the graphic designer. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 After this he seems to have moved to Quest and later Square where he was the artist or character designer on some games you may have heard of, such as "Ogre Battle", "Tactics Ogre", "Vagrant Story", "Final Fantasy Tactics". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Eventually he went on to the big leagues and became the character designer of "Final Fantasy <TWELVE::XII>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So I guess you can blame him for that game is a little Aladdin-looking dude, but everybody ate so much. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So we've got on this far in the game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So here's the ending. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Courtesy of another password Genie, you'll notice your characters bite has changed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's because the curse that transformed them into a girl has been lifted. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So you can now run off of the fairy Princess. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And at the very end, you get rewarded with these automated style illustrations. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The [only] time in-game the characters was shown as being female. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So "Faria" is a clever and original game with an odd sense of humor; that's for sure. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, that's good! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the, sort of, old-school gigantic dungeons and things like lack dungeons requiring flashlights might piss you off a little bit. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And goddamn does your character ever Level Up slowly. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 So it's a weird combination of, sort of, progressive and regressive elements. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But, if nothing else, this game as well as "Ghosts Lyon" showed that do game R.P.G. in Japan were, sort of, slowly moving out of the massive shadow of "Dragon Quest". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Oishinbo: Kyukyoku no Menu 3bon Syoubu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, here's a bit of an oddity. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's an Adventure Game based on a manga... but (get this) it's a food theme the. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 "Oishinbo: Kyukyoku no Menu..." (or 'The Gourmet: Ultimate Menu...'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The manga by Tetsu Korea and Akira Hamasaki began in <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-THREE::1983> and is somehow still running today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's basically about some serious Japanese food snobs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Normally a game like this would be [pretty] impenetrable. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But we do have this [pretty] darn snazzy translation by the Snark. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now if you're expecting something a little different or unusual in this game, something that sort of shakes up the Japanese Adventure Game formula, then prepare to be disappointed. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is an absolute typical look, talk, and go style Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, actually, it does have a few funny moments later, as we'll see. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But mostly you're just standing around listening guys yakking about you know, fog law and that kind of stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 On a side note, California, the state that I live in, managed to recently embarrass ourselves, as we sometimes do, by actually banning Bhagwat entirely. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For the most part in this game, we're going to be doing the whole Look, Look, Talk mambo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 The game doesn't really give you much guidance at beginning or a, sort of, clues as to what you're supposed to be doing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Your characters this guy name she really a mocha reporter at the tozai News. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 For some reason you're working on creating a dish for this gourmet food competition. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You wander around talking to people when, during the conversation with your girlfriend and co worker you go, you hit upon the idea of monkfish liver, which is using a famous Japanese delicacy called 'on chemo'. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game then becomes a hunt for a monk fish. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As I mentioned, the game does occasionally throwing some curveballs at you - like here, where an action menu unexpectedly pops up and gives you four choices: ppl, strike, and Lai. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yellin strike really do nothing but peep attracts the attention of a cop. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You're then screwed and end up going to jail and getting a Game Over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Oishinbo..." does have moments where you get forced to make some arbitrary decision and will lose the game if you make the wrong choice. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Here the correct choice is actually lie. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 On the all you're trying to do is just speak to the chef at this restaurant, so I don't know why it can't just go up and knock on the door. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 From here, you'll end up heading to the docks to book a fishing boat to catch a monk fish. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I've discussed this before at length when covering other Adventure Games like "Princess Tomato...", for example. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But in these Japanese Adventure Games, you have to do a certain number of things in a certain order, in order to open up new menu options and move the story forward. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This means certain events will not happen until you perform some other action that isn't obviously or logically related to the result. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I call these invisible or hidden triggers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But people might call by other names. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Christian maciejewski of game design review, for example, calls it invisible causality. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 For example, when you're looking for the captain of the ship, it turns out he's sitting in a bar. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But you can't just happen to walk into the bar find him. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Instead, you need to look at a couple other places and ask some people about where he is. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Once you've done this, the bar and Captain will magically appear. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 This is frustrating because often for Zoo to walk around talking to people looking at things over and over trying to find that hidden trigger. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 We have some more Game Over potential here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can lose the game by giving the captain too much saki. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But the game gives you no idea how much is too much. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And when you've caught the monkfish you need to repair it in the correct way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Monkfish is, by the way, one of the world's ugliest fishes, but is known for being quite tasty. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 I love this one. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 What happened? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 How exactly did you lose? 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 And again here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But we do get some nice graphic fish building illustrations. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Now once you get the letter out you need to cook it the right way. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 The game did tell you earlier that on chemo it steamed but you are allowed to pick the wrong method. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Once you've done this in the next thing you surprised everyone by pulling out the fish liver. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And if you didn't steam it, everyone is disgusted and it's Game Over. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Otherwise you will win the contest and go on to act two. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Oishinbo..." is reasonably long for this sort of game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There's three acts all together. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, the subject matter is definitely unique and it's fantastic that this was translated. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But if you play it, don't expect anything too mind-blowing. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Perfect Bowling 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 July 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Aisystem Tokyo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tonkin House 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍊🍓 It's our last game today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We close out July <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>, in Japan with a gosh darn Bowling Game, which is a little strange because there are hardly any Bowling Games on FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Yet we just had one in June - Jaleco is a "Big Challenge! ... Go! Bowling" Game for the F.D.S. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 You get to create a character here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Choose a guy or a girl, pick a name, even whether you're left or right-handed, and the weight of the bowling ball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Not too many Sports Games have these kind of options back then. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One nice touches the doubles mode. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You pick your opponent here. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Fred, I love the look, man! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Freddie Mercury stash with aviator headwear? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Excellent! 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But I'm gonna go with Lucy, the purple haired freak. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 This is like a futuristic bowling or something; the pin somehow gets zapped into place by lasers. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You also have this [pretty] elaborate control system. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You can move your character left or right and then actually rotate the ball to control the spin. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's what the green ball on the right-hand side of the screen is for. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You also have the standard Power Meter deal. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, here we go. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That was easy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 "Perfect Bowling" was published by Tonkin House, one of the guys that released about one or two games a year for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm trying to think if they had any other notable releases, and nothing's really coming to mind. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 But it was developed, at least in part, by Aisystem Tokyo. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 At least I think that's supposed to be Aisystem not A.I.System. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Aisystem is, once again, not a name that conjures up fond memories of excitement. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 They did a lot of console ports for Taito as well as stuff like the chinko games for Coconuts Japan. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You not confuse them with Aicom, the company did "All-Pro Basketball". 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So what do you really say about a Bowling Game? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I mean, I guess it's [pretty] good considering the features of like putting spin on the ball; to nice realistic touch. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 But I guess it's a little unbalanced? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Man, you have this Power Meter thing where you want to hit the button at just the right moment. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And hitting it just a fraction of a second too soon we'll get you a gutter ball. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 On the other hand, when you get the timing right you actually throw a lot of strikes. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It seems to be more gradiation between the perfect strike and missing the pins entirely. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, when you get a few strikes in a row, this nutty bird appears. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 If you're wondering what happens when you complete a game, well actually nothing happens. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 You see the final score and then it's back to the title screen. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 That's it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Altogether, I'd guess I'd call this a decent little Bowling Game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 46 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🍊🍓 Alright, there we have it! 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 One thing you may have noticed: we do not have one single F.D.S. game today. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 We usually have one or two per episode, but this time nothing. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I keep predicting the death of that format, but it's not quite dead yet. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 There will still be a few more discs released throughout the year. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And even after that Nintendo and Tacoma Shoten keep the thing going until <NINETEEN-NINETY-ONE::1991>. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So what was our top game today? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 I'm going to hand out two awards. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 One For "Willow" for technical achievement; it's a damn impressive game. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 In one two "Monster Party" for creativity, since that is one nutty game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 As for the Worst Game, well, maybe "Airwolf", or maybe "California Games"? 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 It's kind of a toss up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 So next "Chrontendo...". 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Well, we've already seen the phenomenal Rise of the R.P.G. on the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 Everyone is putting them out by <NINETEEN-EIGHTY-NINE::1989>. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 And in July, the big guys themselves, Nintendo, released an honest to goodness 'Dragon Quest'-style R.P.G., which became a huge colt classic. 🍇🍌


🤖🍊🍓 Also, we're going to see a U.S.-[only] release from Capcom that's actually - well, not exactly will love, but it's [pretty] interesting. 🍇

🤖🍊🍓 See you then. 🍇🍌
