👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chronsega Episode 7 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Hey there* [and] welcome to "Chronsega Episode *7*", [in which] we finish up [*1988* and] move on to [*1989*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *Fall ['88*] is a weird time [for the] Master *System*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Why*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, on *October 29th*, Sega [released] a [*little*] something called the *Mega Drive*, its new 16-[bit] *console*, which, of course, was [intended to] replace the *Master* System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *In the U.S*., we call [it] the Sega *Genesis*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, while *some* systems (such [as] the *FamiCom*) were *strong* enough they could survive [for *quite] a [while]* after their successor console is [*released*], the *Master System* was killed off very *quickly* [in] Japan, with [only] *three* more *games* being released after the Mega Drive *debuted*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *And since Sega* was [probably] expending [most of] its *resources* on creating new *Mega Drive* games, there [doesn't] seem [to] be [that] much *time* or *energy wasted* on *Master [System]* games [this] *episode*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So we [*don't* exactly] have a sterling collection of games today. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Double Dragon 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 01 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Technos Japan | Arc System Works 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Just* last] episode, we were [starting to] see some more non-*Sega* games come [out for the] Master *System*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Our final game [in] "...Episode *Six*" was "*R-Type*" and we [start] off [today] with "Double *Dragon*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Of* course, the game begins with the famous [gut]-punching [and] kidnapping *intro*, though we *don't see* the garage *door* open [and] Jimmy step [out onto] the *street* (like [in] the *Arcade* game). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Speaking* of which, as we know, "Double Dragon" was an *enormously [successful] Arcade* game from Technos *Japan, which* premiered in [1988]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was [probably] the first really popular [Beat]-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And you could] *almost certainly* pin the entire [Beat]-'em-Up *craze* of [the late '80s and] early [*'90s] on* "Double *Dragon*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have lots of *moves* - punches, kicks, and (of course) the enormously useful knee-to-the-face. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] the *thing* [that] really *sold it* was the 2-Player *co-op*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *we already saw* a version [of] "Double Dragon" [for] the *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Let's *take* a quick look [at *that*] version [so] you [can] compare [it] to the Master System "Double Dragon". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 These're the first enemies you *encounter*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hello, *guys! 'Blam!'* [A] punch [to] the face, [*and] they're on* their backs, [and] we can move on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This makes sense, [*right*]? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [These are the very] first [simplest] fights [in] the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, here's the Master System *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alright], *what*!? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They [kicked] me in the face, [first] *thing*!? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] then he takes a *bunch* [of] hits [to] go down! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *basically* [what] happens here is *most enemies* spam the kicking jump [and] they are *much* tougher. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *also* appears they [get] up *very* quickly after being [knocked] down. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *In the N.E.S. version*, [you had] a special move where [ya could] stand over a fallen foe [and beat] the crap [out] of ['im]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya *[don't] have [that]* move *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But [ya] *do* [have] a really lame spinning kick [that] is [*pretty*] much useless. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *You can*, of course, *pick up weapons* such as the *whip*, [but] *all weapons* have *really* [short] range. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the [hit detection] is *really* weird. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Look* [at] this, here! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Is [*this*] on *purpose* or [just] really bad *programming*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Another* [frequent] thing is [that] *you* [and] the *enemy* [will start] *punching* [each] other [at] the same *time* [and you'll] end up, [sort] of, *moving* [right] *through* each other. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [will] remember, the *FamiCom* version reworked "Double Dragon" *substantially* - added in, [sort] of, like, a power-up *system* [and] threw in some *platforming*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Master* [System "Double Dragon"] is a *much* more [accurate] version of the *Arcade* game (with the exception of the graphics [and] enemy *behavior*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The big [improvement] over the *FamiCom game* is [that] the 2-Player *co-op* is, once again, *available*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *FamiCom* version [only allowed for] one *player* [for] the *main* game (as unthinkable [as that] was). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is *probably*] why they made the enemies *tougher* [in] *this* version. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] the *[constant] jump kicking* gets *really annoying* and is a [little] cheap. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Because the [only] really [reliable] attack you *have* is the *jump* kick. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's the [only] attack with enough *range* [to prevent you from] being jump kicked by *enemies*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Even most *weapons* [like] the baseball [bat] are *[completely] worthless* when [it] comes to [defending against] the *jump* kick. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] *times* "Double Dragon", [sort] of, devolves [into] a jump kicking *contest*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The knee-to-the-face, which was a very useful attack [in] the *Arcade* version and the *N.E.S. version* is [*pretty* difficult to] pull off here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On the *[positive] side*, the [technical capabilities of] the [Master System] allow [for] three enemies to appear on-screen [at] *once*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, when this *happens*, [there's *quite*] a [bit] of [sprite flickering that] kicks in. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *still*, "Double Dragon" looks [and] sounds [pretty] *good*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 All over the controls [and] the [hit detection aren't as] good [as] the *N.E.S. version*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game's [definitely not as] *polished*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] hey, [it] has the 2-*Player* option, so [at] least it's somewhat faithful [to] the [spirit] of the Arcade's original. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ys 🇯🇵 // Ys: The Vanished Omens 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Ys" ♪ by Alan Stivell

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nihon Falcom | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Let's take a [listen to] the music, *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This [is] the Japanese version of "*Ys*" [with] the F.M. sound chip *enabled*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's [a] really [great] *baseline* [that] kicks in. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [we'll] take a listen to the *U.S.* version of "Ys", which did [*not*] make use [of] the [sound] chip. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, it's a shame [but] the [artwork] on the [title] screen has been nicely redrawn. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {The} *music* [doesn't really] sound *bad*; [it's just] missing [that] extra *kick*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Ys" (or "Ys: {The} Vanished *Omens*", as the Master [System version] *calls* [itself]) is, of course, a port of Falcom's 1987 Action *R.P.G.*, which had first appeared on Japanese [*computers*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [been ported and] remade *many* many *times*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Just like "Double *Dragon*", there [was] *already* a FamiCom *version*; we covered [it in] "Chrontendo ... [35]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [at] this [point], I [would recommend] going [back to] "...Episode [35" and] rewatching the "Ys" *segment, in* which we do an *overview* of those many [different] versions of "Ys", [starting] with [the original] P.C.-[*88*] game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Since [then], there's been a *P.S.P.* release as *well*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *This* here "Ys" [looks] *very* much like the [original *Computer*] versions [and] the *FamiCom* game, though the [*portraits* have] all been *redrawn*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Aside from that], the Experience system has been reworked a bit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {In} the *FamiCom* "Ys", uh, you needed [to get] 100 Experience [Points to] gain a *level; here* ya need *200*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, [it's *not* as bad as it *sounds*, because] you *also* [get] Experience [from advancing] the [*plot* in] places. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Look here; *after* [accepting] the game's main *quest* I [got] a bunch [of] *Experience* [and] even Leveled *Up*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] now [that I'm] Level *2*, I [can] slice [through] these guys like a [hot] knife [through *butter*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Just like*] the FamiCom version, *I [won't]* discuss "Ys" in any [great lengths], because [we'll] be *saving* that ['til we get to the] much more [better] known TurboGrafx C.D. release, *which* is, far [and] away, the best of the earlier versions of this *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But], I suppose the Master [System will] come in [at second] *place*, [not] counting the more modern *updates*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} [certainly] has [better] music [and] graphics [than the] *FamiCom* game [and] *plus* [it] even came [out in] the *U.S.*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [So, if ya] *wanna* play [an original] version of "*Ys*" [and *aren't*] gonna be playing the *TurboGrafx game*, I suppose you [can] try *this* one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sports Pad Soccer 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵  🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Okay*, [it's] the [last] game of *October*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This actually* came [out] on the *launch* day of the *Mega* Drive. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's "*Sports* Pad *Soccer*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, the *title* screen [and] music seem *really familiar* [to] me. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*That's*] because we've [already] *covered* this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was a [re-released and *retitled*] version of "*World* Soccer", a Master [System] game [from] July [*1987*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the *U.S.*, [it was] called "*Great* Soccer". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *And*, of course, [*that* "Great] Soccer" should [*not*] be [confused] with the game [that] was released in *Japan* under the name "[Great] Soccer" [in 1986] (a [completely *different*] Soccer Game). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, anyway, "*Sports* Pad Soccer" is simply "World Soccer" with altered controls. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It now makes use of the Sega *trackball*, known [as] the Sports Pad controller. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Otherwise, it's exactly] the same game [as] we've already *covered*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *This leaves* [just] *one* [last] Japanese [*Master* System] game in [1988]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Chou-on Senshi Borgman 🇯🇵 // Cyborg Hunter 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 December 01 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Wow! So, *there* were *no* Japanese Master [System] games [released] in *November*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And there [was only] *one* in [*December*], "Chou-on Senshi *Borgman*" (a.k.a. 'Sonic Soldier *Borgman*'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's the *hero, there*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Sega was [not putting] too much [effort into] their [*title*] screens, [obviously]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (*By* the way, the [*title*] screen simply says '*Borgman*', [for] some reason.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [We'll start] the *game up* [and], uh, *look* [your *protagonist*, there], looks a [*lot* like] Boba *Fett*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] take two steps [and] are [*immediately interrupted* ("Metal] *Gear"-style*) by a *transmission* [from your information] *specialist* (or whoever [this] is). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Those of you eagle-eyed enough [to spot] the [copyright to] N.T.V. [and] Toho [probably] already *guessed* this, [but the] *game is* based on [an] existing [intellectual *property*] - namely [an animated] *T.V.* series. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's about] a group [of] young people who wear [powered] suits [and combat an interdimensional] alien [*invasion*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] so it's, [sort] of, in the typical '[Ultraman]'/'Power Rangers' mode. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, [since] Sega [was really committed to releasing] almost every Master [System] game [*internationally*], this did [come out in] the U.S. *[and] Europe* as "*Cyborg* Hunter". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Which] makes *sense* ("Borgman" - "Cyborg Hunter"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though Sega tossed in a big helping of 'do [not] *give* a damn' [and decided that the] bad guys were *cyborgs*, [but did not] make any *changes* to the *sprites*, [which] clearly [depicted] organic *creatures*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *game is* [divided into] seven [distinct] *areas*, A through *G* (each area [consisting] of several long horizontal *floors* [with *elevators* scattered] about [at] each *end*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can *see* this [in] the map up [at] the *top*, there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 That's a *bomb*, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have a [limited supply], so you [should] pick [them] up when you *can*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Enemies* [can] be [pretty] *annoying* [at] first. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These guys jump [right atcha], so [you've gotta step] back, then turn [around and hit 'em]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, [your] fancy-[pants] $200,000,000 military [robot] suit does [not] come [with] a ranged *weapon*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Instead, you *punch* stuff [to] death. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alright], well, [it *actually*] does have a ranged weapon, [but it] *uses [up]* energy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, *here's* one [of] the main cyborg bad guys. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [you're gonna] switch [to] the *Psycho* Punch (which is another example of Japan using the word 'psycho' in a bizarre *way*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This is* [your] ranged *weapon*, [but ya have to use it] *sparingly*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Oh, [and if you're *goin' to] play this*, um, you [probably wanna] know, 'How do I access the [*equipment*] menu?'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Well, ya] *plug in* the [second] *controller* [and hit] one [of] the [*buttons*].) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Using the Psycho Punch drains the P.P. (or Psycho *Power*) [Meter]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Cyborg [Hunter]*" has some weird *control* issues. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For *example*, [to enter an *elevator*], ya stand [in front of] the door [and hit] *Up*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then, once [inside], you go [to] the [*right*] wall [and] press Up or Down [to choose your] *floor*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then press the [*button*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then press Right [to] *exit*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, for] *gosh sakes*, when [ya] *go into [an elevator*], make [sure] you're [*exactly*] in the middle of the [elevator] doors when you press Up the [first] *time* - because pressing Up also [uses your] *bombs*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] if [you're not] standing in [*exactly*] the [right] *place*, you'll waste a *bomb* when [tryin' to get into] the [*elevator*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Cyborg Hunter*" is *vaguely* "Metroid"-like (perhaps a [bit] moreso [than] Sega's earlier "*Zillion*"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] too linear [to] be called a *Metroidvania* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[But ya] do* [need to] grab various *power-ups* [in] each *area*, [in order] to *advance* very far. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In Area *A*, [ya need to get the] *shield*, which [will] allow [ya to] then bypass the deadly *energy* zu... -- beams in Area *B*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *other* thing [ya] need [to] do in each area is [to destroy] the four Cyborg *bosses* (or *Chief* Cyborgs). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That's what] the [little] *radar* screen [in] the upper *left* is for. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When [ya *get] near* one, this *extremely* annoying alarm starts *beeping* [and] you [can] see them approaching on the *radar*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [They're] tougher [than] regular *enemies* [but they're not really] *bosses*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *they [won't]* kill [ya, but] they can [get] the jump on you [and] shave off some *health*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the [*only] way* to *refill [your]* health is [to] pick up a Health *Refill [item]*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *these aren't* even *found* [in] every single *area*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *once* [you've] *cleared* an area, you [can] then go back [to] Area *A* [and] pick up [an] easy-[to-*get*] Health Refill or a Psycho Power refill *there*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] "*Cyborg* Hunter" [isn't] a terrible game, [it *doesn't exactly*] seem like a [lotta effort was put] into it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Check [out]* the *jet* engine [or jetpack that lets you] *fly* over dangerous *areas*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [We'll] turn [it] *on* and... Whoa! Really!? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They *[couldn't] add*, like, a [little] f... -- you know, sh... -- jet of *fire [or] something* [shooting out] the [*back* to indicate that] you're using a [*jetpack*]? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *No*, [it's just your] regular [sprite, but] now ya can move [around] freely [in] the *air*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} looks *really silly*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another *extremely helpful* thing you'll find on *this* level is a *laser* gun [that] doesn't use up *Psycho* Power, thus making dealing [with regular] *enemies* much less [*frustrating*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so *here's* the first real boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, because [this] is based on an *anime, all* the bosses look like the villains [from] the *T.V. show* (so they're all really *boring*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is [just] some *chick* in a *cape* who jumps around. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 After you *[defeat] her*, ya [get] her *keycard*, which will [allow ya to] open the door [in] the main *hallway* [and] access the next [set] of *areas* (D, E, [and] *so* on). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As [I'm] *sure* you've *noticed, every level* [we've] seen is [just, sort] of, a generic-looking Science Fiction *corridor* [that] stretches [out] *horizontally*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's *really* nothing even resembling *level design* [in this] *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's [*probably*] a [*good* thing that] each area has [different] *enemies or* "Cyborg Hunter" [would] be *far* too boring [to] play. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] does offer a [bit] of variety [at] *times* - like levels [with] no [*lights* that require] you [to] use, [like], a special [*light*] ray gun [to] *see* anything. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *sad thing* is "*Cyborg* Hunter" is *really* the [*only*] halfway-[decent original] *game* [for] the *Master* System, this episode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the [*only*] other *console* game [which] Sega released in [*December*] was a Japanese-[only] [*Platformer*] on the *Mega* Drive. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *Sega* ended up [basically sitting out] the [holiday] *season* in *Japan*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Rampage 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bally | Midway | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Activision 🇺🇸 // Sega 🇬🇧 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [That's it] for Japanese games in [1988, but] we [still have] a few U.S. and/or *European* games [to contend] with. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [There are] no [exact *dates* for] these things, [but] I [*believe*] they were [released] near the end of [1988]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, "Rampage"*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Didn't] we [just] see this [in] 'Chrontendo'? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yeah*, [Data] East [released it in] the U.S. [in December '88], so both Sega [and] Nintendo *loyalists* could enjoy "Rampage" [at] home. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It also] came [out] on the Atari [*7800* in *1989*], so every console of [that] generation had a version of "*Rampage*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hell! Activision released "Rampage" [for] the [*2600*] in [1989]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yeah, [believe it or] not*, uh, official [Atari 2600 releases] continued [until *1990*]! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *There's [probably*] no need [to] go over [what] "Rampage" *is*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But, just in] case, [it] was a [pretty] cool *Arcade* game [from] Bally [*Midway* in *1986*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] allowed for 3 Players *simultaneously*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Each controlled a [giant] *monster* [and] the [*object*] was simply to destroy buildings [and *eat*] people. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was [pretty] *cool*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, the Master System version *looks* [pretty] *good* ([better] than the *N.E.S. version*)! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*But* it's only] for 2 Players, not 3. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There *is something* very [*notable about*] "Rampage", *namely* [that it was *not] published* by *Sega* [but] by *Activision*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yes*, third-[party] publishers finally arrived on the *Master* [System] in the *U.S.*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *Japan*, [there] were a couple *Tecmo games*, [released] by [the] mysterious company called *Salio*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But], *other* [than *that], every* Master System *game* has been published by *Sega*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [there *weren't] many* third-party games *released* in the *U.S.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [Master System didn't really have] much *time* left over here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But in] *Europe* (once the console really took *off*) there were games being released guy -- by guys like Virgin, U.S. Gold, Domark, [and] *many* more. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Anyway*, the *Master System* "Rampage" is [*pretty*] unremarkable. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This would've [seemed pretty] cool back in [*1988*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But nowadays, I guess [it's pretty] hard [to get] too excited [about] this. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? 🇺🇸 🇧🇷 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Brøderbund | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Parker 🇺🇸 // Tec Toy 🇧🇷 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Our next] game is [also from] a third-[party] *publisher, Parker* Brothers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the game is... "*Where* in the [World] is Carmen *Sandiego*?". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As [you can] tell by this [*title*] screen here, [the] *game* takes place in a post-[apocalyptic] *world* where *deserts* cover North America [and] *Europe*, [and only] a *handful* of buildings [are still] *standing*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In "Chrontendo ... [43]", we saw the first N.E.S. games [from Milton] *Bradley* (the *other* big board game company [in] the U.S.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Parker* Brothers (their *rival*) [had been releasing] console games [for *quite*] a [while]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They had [put out] some [for] the Atari [*2600*], for [example]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *And* a [while later], they *too* [started] making *N.E.S.* games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Ironically*, after [100] years of being [*competitors*], Parker Brothers [and Milton] *Bradley both* [ended up] being [*bought*] by Hasbro. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This* [looks like] a *Telex* device! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] you youngsters [out] there, [it's] like [an] electronic *telegraph*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya see [them in old] *spy* [movies]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "We [just got] a telex [from] *Interpol*.". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They always say [that in] those [kinda] movies. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here's* where ya enter [in your] name, choose the difficulty, [*and it'll* explain] the mission [to ya]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] a -- [technically] a [port] of the *first* '...Carmen Sandiego' video *game*, [originally released] for [*Computers*] by *Brøderbund*, back [in *1985*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The '...Carmen Sandiego' games ended up becoming Brøderbund's most high *profile games*, with [countless] *sequels, books*, and ([starting in] the early [*'90s*]) a very [popular] kids' *game* show. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Okay*, so *here's* the deal. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Carmen's* gang has stolen a national *treasure* ([in] this case, a *mosaic* from the Hagia *Sophia* in *Istanbul*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, ya* fly [to] Istanbul, where [ya find several] *buildings* you [can] *enter*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (And by 'enter' I mean [ya] walk up [to] the [front and] press a [*button*]; *you* never get [to] see the actual *inside* of the building.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Some person [will then] make a [statement about] the *thief*, usually pertaining [to] where he is *headed* or some fact about the thief [*himself*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, he [*planned* to] study *volcanoes*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, [let's] see [if] we [can] figure [that] out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, we know [he] went [to] one [of] these *places*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm thinking *Reykjavik*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 When ya reach [the next *city*], you, [sort] of, [keep repeating] the whole *thing* - [getting] clues [and tryin' to remember] where the -- where [he went] to *next*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If ya *choose* the wrong *destination*, the people [inside] the buildings [will] tell ya they [didn't] *see* anyone *suspicious* around. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This mostly [wastes] time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] see, everything ya do, [such as] take a [*flight*] or ask a *question*, moves the clock *forward*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So, ya *don't*] have time [to] ask too many *questions* or travel [to] the wrong *cities*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In *Reykjavik*, [someone] mentions he [was interested in] Spanish colonial *history*, which *indicates*, I *guess*, Buenos *Aires*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Eventually*] you'll reach a [*certain* city and] the suspect will *be* there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [before you can] *apprehend 'em*, you [must get] a *warrant*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So], use the clues ya have [to] narrow [it] down to a [particular] member [of] Carmen's *gang*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [at] *this [point]*, once you've [gotten to] the [correct *city*], you'll [find that] the thieves' *henchmen* are walking *around*, [and when] they *see* you, they'll throw a *knife* atcha. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Getting hit] causes a [*pretty*] serious loss of time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I was [actually] having major *difficulties* [with] the *game* because I could [not] dodge the *knife*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] see, there's a *jump* [button], which I *assume* would be [used to] jump over the *knife* when [it was] *thrown* [at] you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, this never *worked*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *turns [out* you should just] move *downward* [and the] knife {will} go [right] over [your] head. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Eventually*], the thief himself [will appear and] be arrested. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] then move on [to] the *next* theft and [start] *again* [until] you've finally reached Carmen Sandiego, *herself*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's *[almost] hard* [to] *critique* a '...Carmen Sandiego' *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, [it] is a kid's es... -- *educational* game, after all, [and] *obviously* [it] did *something* [right, since the] series was *massively successful*, [but it] is [pretty] repetitive. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *so many* [of] the clues [involve] knowing the *colors* of the country's *flags*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, *seriously*, [can] you name the colors [in] Sri *Lanka's flag*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *I* can't. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] *game* has a goofy sense [of] humor. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [next] thing stolen, from New York *City*, is... 'The *Rockettes*'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya know, *Carmen's gang* [really aren't] a very good gang [of] *thieves*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Why [do] they go on a multi-city international *vacation* every time they *steal* something? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] why [do] they *blab* [about] themselves [and] where [they're] going to *next* [to], like, every person they *meet*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well, anyway*, it's '...Carmen Sandiego'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Take [it or] leave [it]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Monopoly 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nexa Corp. 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I [notice] {a} few games [this] episode use [old] public *domain* music [for] the *music*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "[*Monopoly*]" uses [Scott] Joplin's "The [*Entertainer*]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Why*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Who *knows*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *this is* weird. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *We [just]* saw Parker Brothers [release] '...Carmen *Sandiego*', a game owned by *Brøderbund*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And next up is "*Monopoly*" - Parker Brothers' [most] famous *product* - released by *Sega*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, why did Parker Brothers *pay* [to release] a game [owned] by [some] other *company* [and] then take the [rights to one of] their *own* games, "*Monopoly*", [and] license [it to] *Sega*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Welcome [to] the strange [world] of *video games*, I *suppose*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *But* what's [*not* mysterious] is the *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a *video* game based on "*Monopoly*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's *it*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you've played "*Monopoly*", [then] you know [exactly what] this is *like*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *This is one* of a couple [of] *U.S.*-[developed] games today. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, [it] was done by *Nexa*, a San *Francisco*-based *software* company, founded by Gilman *Louie*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Aside* [from his] *own* company's games, *Louie is* known for [his part] in the whole "*Tetris*" saga, which we *should* be covering in detail in "Chrontendo ... [45]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Game [Developer] *Research* [Institute has an *interview* with one of] the *programmers* [at] Nexa, who worked on "*Monopoly*", Kevin *Seghetti*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *He remarks* [that] "Monopoly" was, [sort] of, Sega's way of testing [out] the [*waters* for having] American *companies* make [Master System] *games*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*design*] is, [sort] of, *odd* [and] *inconsistent*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The main *board* screen is *really dull* - [just] a [*completely* uninteresting] replication [of the] "Monopoly" *game* board. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] no frills [at] *all*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For *example*, when ya land on [*Community*] Chest [or] something, [it doesn't] even show you a *card*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It just] has some text saying 'bank [error in your] *favor*'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 (*By* the *way*, [as] someone who [used to] work [at] a [bank], if ya ever [get] a bank [error in your] favor you [should *probably*] give the money back. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The bank [will] eventually find *out* and [want] the *money*.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [while most of] the game is really *boring*, they *did* [put] all this [*effort* into] the scenes where [your] pieces move [around] the *board*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's *all [these* little] *details* - like the wheels on the *car turn*, the iron throws up, like, *dust* [or *sparks* or something as it] drags along the *ground*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I *love* the [*redesign*] on the *hat*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's, like, {the} [kinda hat that], like, uh, Harvey *Keitel's* character in "*Taxi* Driver" [woulda] worn. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Alright], so "Monopoly" [is definitely not] *exciting*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] as the first U.S.-[developed] Master System *game*, [it] is [historically *important*]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Early - Mid-1989 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 We've *now* [gotten] to [*1989*] - a [*pretty*] slow *year* [for the] Master System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 New games continue [to] be released in the U.S. [and] *Europe*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *But, unlike* the *Japanese* releases, we [don't really] have a [lot] of [information], along the lines [of] the [actual *release] dates* [for] these games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *strict* chronological order is [pretty] much [outta] the question, from this [point] *onward*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still*, we *will* carry on the best we *can*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Bomber Raid 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 February 04 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sanritsu 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇯🇵 // Activision 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here we are at February 2nd, and it's the end [of] the road [for] the Master [System in] Japan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Looking [at] this [*title*] screen, it's *funny*, [it] looks [just like] how early FamiCom games were; they all had those simple [*black* title] screens. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yet*, here we are years [*later*], [and] "Cyborg Hunter" [and] "Bomber Raid" both have these generic-looking [*title*] screens. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's called [*effort*], Sega; [look it] up. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Bomber Raid" is [mostly] known [for] being the last Japanese [release for the] Master *System*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Video game* consoles *rarely* [go out with] a *bang* and "Bomber Raid" is no *exception*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a simple [vertical] *[Shoot]-'em-Up* with a military *theme*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was the [sorta] game [that] was [*reasonably* popular in] the [late '80s]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Think of Capcom's '[*1942*]' series, [for] *example*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One thing* here [that] *bugs* me ([at] least in the *opening* sequence) is [that] the *background* interferes [with your] ability [to] see the enemy planes [and] *projectiles*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *gets* a [little better] when ya move [out into] the *ocean*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's really noo... -- nothing too crazy [or exciting] going *on*, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya shoot enemy] planes [and] ships. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If ya [shoot] the glowing *disk* things, they will drop a '*P*' icon or an '*S*' icon. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The '*P*' (or *Power*) icon [will increase your] *weapon* [and] '*S*' [will increase your] *Speed*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya *hafta* collect *quite*] a few '*P*' icons [before] ya see much of a *difference*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Gradually*, [your peashooter] becomes a *little* less wimpy, but this is [not] a Compile game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Don't] expect [any], like, really awesome weapons [to] happen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya also [get] these *numbered* power-up icons, which add *wingmen* (much like in ["1942" and "*1941*"]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Different] numbers [will represent different] formations [and] directions of *fire*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Okay*, so here I've stayed alive long enough [to get] a [decent] *weapon*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This will allow us [to] easily take on the first boss, which is a [gigantic *battleship*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Ya have a* very [limited] stock of bombs [as] *well*, which are useful [for] taking [out multiple] cannons [at] *once*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One problem* with "Bomber Raid" is [that], like *so many* other [*Shooters*], if ya die, you lose all [your] *power-ups*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If [this] happens during a boss [battle (or right *before*]), you [will] be [*pretty*] much [helpless]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, *here's* me [tryin' to] take [out] the boss with a basic [*peashooter*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I... can't even get lined *up* [to] fire off a [*shot* at] the cannons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [if] this *happens* [to ya], I hope ya [have] a [lotta] bombs. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Bomber Raid*" was [developed] by *Sanritsu, who were* doing [development] on some [of] the Master [System titles at this] point. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's nothing real -- too terribly *wrong* with this *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [just] a [little] on the *boring* side. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*At least*] the bosses [are pretty] cool. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [second] one is this [giant] *tank*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you [defeat him], ya sorta get into, like, another [battle] with a *mini* tank. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm *fully* powered *up* here, [which *makes* this] guy *too easy*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Overall*, "Bomber Raid" feels [kind] of *unbalanced*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 With *good weapons*, it's too *easy*... [until ya] make one tiny mistake [and] *die*; then [it] becomes too hard. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [kinda] *sad* because *Sega* had a *reputation* [for great] *Action* Games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But there [*weren't*] very many strong 2D [*Shoot*]-'em-Ups on the *Master* System - other [than "*Fantasy*] Zone". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Bomber* Raid" is *okay*, but [it] feels old-fashioned {compared} [to] some [of] the [contemporary] games on the FamiCom [and] the P.C. *Engine*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just] consider *this*: A few [months] after "*Bomber Raid*", Hudson [released] "Blazing *Lasers*" on the *P.C.* Engine, which [just] shows exactly how old-*hat* stuff like this *was*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Walter Payton Football 🇺🇸 // American Pro Football 🇬🇧 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *As* I [stated *earlier*], we [don't] have anything even *near exact* release dates [for] the rest of [today's] *games*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] based on mentions in gaming magazines, I *think* they were all [from] the first half of [*1989*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [We'll start with] "Walter [Payton *Football*]", which, I *suppose*, is the follow-up to "Reggie [Jackson] *Baseball*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A [lot of] Sports Games [at] this time simply [licensed] the name [and likeness] of one *player*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So far*, [this] looks like every *other* [Football] *Game* - 1 [or] 2-Player *options*, there's a Single Game mode, [and] a 'Road [to] the Super Bowl' mode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's even a [*difficulty* setting] and a *few more* options. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *teams* are, of course, [identified] by [city] name [*only*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Since [this is] a Walter [*Payton*] game, I suppose we'll go with *Chicago*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game [starts with] a *coin toss*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I *love* the *[Football] League* logo on the *field*, which is *clearly* made [to resemble] the *N.F.L.* logo in a non-infringing [sorta] way. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now, this] is the [second Football] Game on the Master *System*, the [first] being "[*Great* Football]", [released in *1987* in] *Japan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Walter [Payton Football*" is quite] a [bit *better*] looking, I *guess*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The sound [is] *decent*, [but it] *does* have [some] *really wonky speech* samples. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "[Interception]!"🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] some reason, [it obtained] a European release under the name "American *Pro* [Football]" - *really* [just] the same game with the references [to Walter Payton *removed*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], we [just] saw a game called "John Elway's [*Quarterback*]" in "Chrontendo ... [*43*]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *reminds me* very much [of] *this* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [not] nearly [as] *fun*, [in] my *opinion*, as "*Tecmo* Bowl", [but] I guess [it's] a [bit] more *technical*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They're more *play options*, you [can] use a Time Out, *[that sorta] thing*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *still*, I'd *much rather* play "*Tecmo* Bowl" [than] *this*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*But* if] you were one [of] those kids that got the *Master* System [instead of] the N.E.S., I suppose [that] you could still have fun with this game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Time Soldiers 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Alpha Denshi | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Alright! "Time* Soldiers" (no relation to "Time Crisis", I'm *afraid*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This intro [explains the] *story*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ...except 'No, [wait; it] doesn't!'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A [giant robot] who [had] one arm replaced [with] a bunch [of] *yarn* has turned all our [friends into little] red *spheres*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, for] some reason, [in order to] *rescue them*, [you need to] travel throughout *time*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That] makes no sense *whatsoever*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But], hell! Ya know, back [in] the [*'80s*], games [didn't] need [to] make *sense*, [right]? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "*Time Soldiers*" was originally a [1987] *Arcade* game, manufactured by *S.N.K.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It was] another one [of] those vertical Run-'n'-Gun games (like "Ikari Warriors"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It even] had the [rotary] *joystick*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *main* difference was, [instead] of being a boring [old] *jungle*, [ya traveled] through a few [different] *time* periods. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But the] game was [actually *developed*] by *A.D.K.*, [otherwise] known as Alpha *Denshi*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They were [an] *Arcade* game *developer* [that ended] up [designing] games [for] S.N.K.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They [later did] stuff like, uh, the 'World Heroes' series of [Fighting] Games [and], of course, "Twinkle Star [*Sprites*]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They [eventually] were absorbed [*into*] S.N.K.. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just like] the home version of "Ikari *Warriors*", the *Master* System "*Time* [Soldiers]" changes the controls, [so that] you fire in [whatever direction] you happen [to] be *moving*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It actually] feels a [*lot*] like the 'Ikari...' *games* - [just without] *tanks*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though enemies [will] drop very limited-use special *weapons* occasionally. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's one [of] the *bosses* - a *triceratops*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Oh man*! I got [*hit*] after I *killed* [him]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I always [*hate it*] when [that] happens. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] then travel through *time* to another *level* - 'The *World Wars*'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] some [kind] of *futuristic* level, I guess. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Note*] the *plethora* of large *columns* which are [not *supporting*] anything (much like Konami's "*Jackal*"). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [As] ya may [have *noticed*, your] basic [*peashooter* doesn't really] *kill* much. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Bullets just] *bounce off* most [enemies]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And I don't really] have *time* [to just, like, stand there *shooting* at] guys a bunch [of] times. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I} [mean], I hafta keep cranking these new *episodes* out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *This boss* [is] *basically* King *Ghidorah*, except with *puny* [little] *wings*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, here's, [sort] of, the real boss; it's a *big*-ass *tank*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The thing is, [your] special weapons disappear very *quickly*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, odds are, you'll be using the [peashooter on this] guy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [I've] now [destroyed the] *boss* [and] rescued one [of] my *comrades*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, I've got [to] look for... Laplace(?) (The [18th] century French [mathematician]? *That's* weird.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This level [is] based on World War *I*, I [suppose]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I [think] "Time [Soldiers]" suffers [from] lame *level [design]*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *whole game* is [sort] of *blah*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It *also* doesn't help that the] number of [different] *time periods* is *very limited* [and, throughout] the game, ya [keep] going back [to] the same ones over [and] *over* again. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} [doesn't] really suffer [from] all the -- the *ugliness* [and technical] problems of the N.E.S. '[*Ikari*]...' games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But at least] "Ikari..." [lets ya] hop into a tank [and] go *nuts*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Time Soldiers*" could *really* use a [bit] more *variety*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, it's [not] a *horrible* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [just cannot] get too excited [about] it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 California Games 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Epyx | Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, Lord! [Not] another one... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yes, we've [got to] suffer through another *port* of an *Epyx game* - this time "*California* Games". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We [just] did the Rare-[developed] *N.E.S.* port of "*World* Games" [in the last] episode of '*Chrontendo*'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [ya] know the story by now - Epyx, a Bay Area software company, had *huge hits* with "Winter Games", Summer Games, "California Games", [and] *so on*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They blew all their money on coke [and] *strippers* [or] something, [and] then filed [for bankruptcy] in [*1989*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Before they *disappeared*, they sold their [*design*] for a [handheld] *console* to *Atari* who ...l... -- [released it] as the *Lynx*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya actually *pick* a *sponsor* [in] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Did *Epyx* get *money* [from] these *companies*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And just what] did they do [with] all [that] money? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [ya] know, my feelings [about] these *games*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Why* are they so [*complicated*]? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Every event] has its own *unique* [set] of *controls*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *playing* these things is like [tryin' to] learn some [sorta] secret *code*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *manual* [to] the original *[Computer] version* was, like, 14 *pages*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *this was [not]* like a [little] N.E.S.-[style] *manual*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These were *big* full *pages*, crammed full of *text* [and] *diagrams*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *control scheme* was *so confusing*, [it] needed *diagrams*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Do you [remember] "Track [& Field" from] *Konami*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {You} didn't need [to] read instructions {to} know how [to] play [that] *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [just] *walked up to the machine* [and] you [just]... knew how [to] play the *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was [*intuitive*]! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The controls just made *sense*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is [exactly] the *opposite*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The main *challenge* is figuring [out] the *control* scheme. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Aside* from [*that*], I *guess* the game looks *okay* ([better than] the "Winter Games" or "*World* Games" on the *FamiCom*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *There're* six *events* - Skateboarding on the halfpipe, *Hacky* Sack, Surfing, Roller Skating, *B.M.X. Biking*, [and] *Frisbee*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, since '*Hacky* Sack' and '*Frisbee*' are [*trademarked*] names [owned] by *Whammo*, the [events are] called '[*Foot*] Bag' and 'Flying *Disc*'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Now, I* suppose when we were kids, we had way [too] much *time* on [our] hands, [and] we [could] spend hours futzing [around with] games like this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *nowadays*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, [come] on, you [can] learn [how to] play the new '*Starcraft*' game quicker [than] you can "*California* Games". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [just don't] have the patience. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *Frisbee*? It's the *worst*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have this *Power* [Meter] thing, [but instead] of, uh, [hitting] a [button] (like ya do in every other *similar game*) ya need [to] press *Left* [and] then [Right] on the *D-Pad*, when the line is at the [correct] *spot*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Why*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *why* [is it] so hard [to] catch the damn *frisbee*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It just] sails [right] *through me*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*weird thing* about] "California *Games*" is [that it's] easier [to] catch a *frisbee*, or *roller* skate, or [kick] a *hacky* sack in [real]-life [than it] is in the game, *itself*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [So], *anyway*, that's "California Games" [for] the Master System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Expect [to] see a *FamiCom* version [before] too long. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Montezuma's Revenge 🇺🇸 ✨

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *one* [of] the things [in] *this* episode is [not] like [the] others, [and that] thing *is* "Montezuma's [Revenge]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hmm! So, *Parker* Brothers [just got] a deal goin' [to] release Master [System] *games*, [and it] *seems* like [they're] already [out] of *ideas*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Thus, [for] *some reason*, they [decided to port] one of their ancient *Computer* games, "Montezuma's *Revenge*" to the *Master* System. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'll admit] the [*title] screen* looks [pretty] *good* (much better [than] some [of] the stuff [Sega] was [putting out] on its *own* games [at] the *time*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But what's the] deal [with this] *music*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Just] like "*Monopoly*", I guess they [couldn't] be bothered [to write an] original *tune*, here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "[Montezuma's Revenge]" *first* appeared on the Atari [*800*] back in [*1984*, published] by Parker *Brothers*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[It] was [originally* designed] by a [little] company called *Utopia*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was very much in the Explorer Game *genre back then*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Those were Platformer games involving some guy jumping, climbing ladders, [and] *so on*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These usually took place [in] a cave [and] the object was to [collect] jewels [or] something like [that]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Similar] games were "*Pitfall II*" [and "*Spelunker*]". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Montezuma's* [Revenge]" was [*ported*] to *every* [platform] *conceivable* - the, uh, Atari [*2600*], [*5200*], Commodore [*64*], *Colecovision*, *Apple*, [and] now, *finally*, the Sega Master *System*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *The game is [only]* five years *old*, [but] seems *way [old-fashioned]* by [1989] *standards*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I've said [it before] and [I'll] say [it] again - *video games [changed* and] evolved *much more quickly* in the [*'80s* and *'90s*] than they do *now*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like... What came out five years ago? "Super *Mario Galaxy*"? "Modern *Warfare*"? "*Assassin's* Creed"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Really, [not that] much [has] *changed*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "[Montezuma's Revenge]" is [*pretty* decent] for one of these *sorts of games* ([not that] there's anything *wrong* [with this] kinda game). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [just that] after "Super [Mario] Bros. *3*" [and] "Mega Man *2*", this seems [*pretty] old-hat*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Jump over snakes [and] skulls, [ya find] *keys*, pick up a treasure [for *points*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It's a [decent]-looking *upgrade* [of the original] *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [just] wish they took {the} time [to] actually add some *music*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Most [of] the game is in [pretty] much, uh, [complete] *silence*, other than the *sound* effects. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*There're* multiple] difficulty levels, [but] they're *really* all the same [*layout* and] the same *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You] know, the usual frustrations here occur - wonky *jumping*, the [fact that ya can't] fall more than a few *feet* [without] *dying*, ... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] if you're *looking* for a *version* of an *old* Atari [*800*] game with upgraded *graphics*, then "Montezuma's [Revenge]" is your guy. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Galaxy Force 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 ✨

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Activision 🇺🇸 // Sega 🇬🇧 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here* we have another ill-advised [port] of a Super Scaler *Arcade game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This one is "*Galaxy* Force". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's not] nearly as famous [as] "*OutRun*" or "*Space Harrier*" [but] Sega [seemed determined to put] all [of] these things [out] on their home *consoles*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *structure* [is] actually [sorta] like "*Mega* Man"! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] choose the order [of the] *planets* (or '*scenes*', [as the] game calls *them*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, [there's] a fire planet, ice [planet], {and} so on. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *game* looks [pretty] *good* [at] the *beginning*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] I [*really* shouldn't] be too *hard* on this; *Sega clearly tried*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] the *[bottom] line* is [that] "*Galaxy* Force" was a bleeding-edge *Arcade* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the idea of *taking* [it and converting it to] the *Master System* [just] seems like a bad *idea*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *We covered* "Galaxy Force" back [in] the "[1988] Arcade *Round*-Up". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was a game [that, *at that] time*, looked freaking *amazing* and was the [first] game [to] use the, uh -- Sega's spanking [brand] new Sega *Y* Board. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [There] were *tons* of *spaceships, asteroids*, {and} laser [blasts] flying around everywhere. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *pseudo*-3D [effects] were *so smooth* looking [and you could] *fly inside* these enemy *fortresses*, like they were the *Death* Star. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once inside, there were tons of laser turrets [and] you [need] -- *need* [to] *maneuver* [around] twists [and] *turns*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Make* a [mental note] of this part *here* where ya go around the *corners*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Okay*, so *here's* the fortress on the Master System version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We *enter* and... *Oh, Good Lord*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 People [with] *epilepsy* [better not] watch this part. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, there's a *corner* coming up, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Oh*, dear *God*! What's *happening*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yeah*, the corners are *hard* as *hell* [to] *go* around; ya keep running [into] *walls*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In the *Arcade* version, making the turns was *easy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] like you [were], like, playing a *Driving* Game [or] something. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You could [sorta] *clearly see* what's going *on* [and] *where* the walls *were*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] on *this* version, the animation is so *jumpy*, [and] everything is so *flickery*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, *quite] frankly*, [most of] the game is [not that] *hard* [until you get inside] the *fortresses*; then things fall *apart*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here it is, *again*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's like] there's [almost] no room [for *error*] because [the] passage [is] so *narrow*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Now*, the *more* ya play "Galaxy Force", the *more* ya will [get *accustomed* to] this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *secret* is [that ya] need [to] hug the [outer] wall [while] *turning* (so much [that it] *looks* like you're *gonna [hit it*]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Otherwise] you'll [hit] the *inner* wall. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Anyway, there's* no bosses [or] anything. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Eventually ya just] fly outta the *fortress* [and everything] blows *up*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Then it's back to] the stage *select* screen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *controls* [are] very similar [to] "AfterBurner"'s. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have a [peashooter and what], I *suppose*, [are] guided *missiles* [that] lock [onto] *enemies*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *The missiles* [are *unlimited*], so it's best to [constantly] fire them [in order to] quickly take out enemies as they *appear*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Also*, [just] like "AfterBurner", *two* [slightly different] versions of the Arcade game were released, [and] Sega chose to *name them* "Galaxy Force" [and] "Galaxy Force *II*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, when ya see references [to] "Galaxy Force *II*", [note that it's *not*] a real *sequel*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once [ya complete] all four missions, ya move on [to] the final *level*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, I *believe* the Arcade game had *one more level* than the Master *System*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They [*probably couldn't* fit the other] level on the *cartridge*, [because "*Galaxy* Force" already] had a 4 [Megabit *cart*], so [it] was [pretty] huge, as-*is*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's *really* [not] much *to* the last *level*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But once [ya get] *through [it]*, you've [beaten] the *game* [and ya get] the classic '*Congratulations*' screen, [and] a [little animated], uh, ending *sequence*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Hey! *What*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Oh*, so I got the *bad ending*, because I used the *'Continue' option*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hmm. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Right*], so if ya *die once*, "Galaxy Force" says, 'Screw you; try *again*.'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*But*] if ya *do* finish the game without *dying*, then [ya get] the real *ending*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's a very brief [animated] *sequence* [and] then [it] actually shows digitized [*pictures*] of the [*development*] staff. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *I'd say* [that] "Galaxy Force" is an honest [effort from] *Sega*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But *still*, the [end] result falls a [bit] *short*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Later] on* [there'd] be a Genesis *version* which plays much more *smoothly, as* ya would expect. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Alf 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sphere 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *This [episode* has] been plagued by a *lotta* so-so games, [but] *nothing* really *too* awful [so] *far*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well, kusoge fans*, I've saved the [best for] *last*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Alf*" is a *truly* terrible [*Adventure*] Game, based on the [1980s] *T.V.* show. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] those of you too young [to *recall*], 'Alf' was a typically lame 'fish outta water' *SitCom*, in which an *alien* crash lands on *Earth* [and] moves in with an all-American suburban *family*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *joke* here is the alien [doesn't] behave like your standard Science *Fiction alien*, [but instead acts] like a New Jersey insurance salesman [or somethin']. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 His name is Gordon *Shumway* [and] *even* [demonstrates] some classic [late '80s *attitude*] by wearing *sunglasses* [and] acting all *sassy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 From [*what*] I [recall], [*90%* of] the show consisted of Alf saying he [wanted to eat] the family's *cat*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the *weird* thing [about] 'Alf' was [that] the [*producers* went] through *all this trouble* of *pretending* [that] Alf was *not* a [puppet] or [some] guy in a *costume* [but] was a real-life *alien*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the puppeteers had [to] be [hidden from] view [at] all times [and] the empty costume could never be *photographed* or *seen* by anyone who [wasn't] involved in the so... -- show's production. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There was [an] earlier 'Alf' game, "Alf: The First [*Adventure*]". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] had a similar *plot* (Alf needed [to] fix his *spaceship*) [and] the [box art used] the same *illustration* as "Alf" (the *Master* System game). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, I [don't] think [that] the two games [are] actually [*related*] or [that] this [is] really inspired by the earlier [*Computer*] game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Like I* said, "Alf" is *an* Adventure Game - [sort] of in the "King's Quest" mode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The ultimate goal is {to} fix his [crashed] spaceship. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*And*] this is [naturally] done [in the] most [roundabout] way *possible*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya start] by walking [around], tryin' to open [*things*, and] pick up anything ya *can*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Along* the way, these *incredibly* [short] guys in suits [and] wide-[brimmed] *hats* [will] try [to] *grab* you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They *look* like *perverts*, [but] I suppose [they're supposed to] be some [sort] of government agents looking [for] *Alf*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though [it] *does* seem a [little] odd these guys [can just] walk around [wherever] they *please, including* inside [your] house. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *you'll* soon encounter a [locked] *door* [and] Alf says he'll find a *key*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] the [only] really [interesting] place [you can] go *so far* [is] the *basement*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, see [that] thing down there? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's a *rat* [and] *touching* [it will instantly] *kill* Alf [and] send [his] soul up [to] *heaven*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I was [actually tryin' to] jump *over* the [rat], there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [What] I *should've* done is [hit] the *action* [button], which [released] the *cat* (which I picked up er... -- *earlier*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If *nothing else, "Alf"* keeps things simple by making [inventorying] commands [*completely*] text-free. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [correct item will automatically] be *used* [if you hit the *command* button] in [an] appropriate spot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, in *most* areas, [the] game [completely] falls [apart] - such [as in] the game's [*hit detection*], controls, [and trying to navigate] the *Action* sequences. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *This* [part] *here*, where [ya need to] fend off *bats* using a *salami, [must]* be among the [worst Platforming or] Action sequences *I've encountered*, so *far*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Jumping onto a [*platform* or] over [an] *enemy* is *very iffy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the *[hit] detection* when [*swinging* the *salami* at] the *bats* is [just *bizarre*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Sometimes bats* [will] fly [right] up [at] you, [as] you flail [away] with [the] salami, [and *hit*] you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Other times* they are nowhere *near the salami* [and it registers as] a [*hit* and] they go flyin' *off*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Look* [at] this! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *What*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [if] *you guys* try going [out and] *playing this game*, you will give up when [you] reach this *sequence*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] is [utterly] *ridiculous*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Almost*] as *bad* i... -- are the *roadway* sequences. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya know], there's *no cars* here, [but] *tons* [of] kids on *bicycles* (or [*motorcycles*] or [*whatever*] they are). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*This is] one [of* those] deals where the *enemies* are [completely] *2D* [in] terms of [hit *detection*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *you [can] be* on the *sidewalk* [and] the kid'll be riding down the middle [of] the *street*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] if the *pixels* [in the] top of their *hair* intersect with the pixels of [your] *foot*, you'll die. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*What you're* supposed to] *do* here is [*get*] the [closet] *key* by selling the [gold] *nugget* [that ya] found [in] the *tunnels* [below] the [*basement*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's not] made *clear* why the general store [is] selling a *key* to a [*closet*] in your *house*, or even why the [closet] is kept *locked, or* why the key sells [for] *$50 or* why a gold [*nugget*] is [*only*] worth $50. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Generally* speaking, the *entire* game continues on much like this; {it} [doesn't really] make much sense. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *"Alf" was* [developed] by a Western *company, Sphere*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Some sources* say *Nexa* [but, according to that] same [interview] on Game [Developer] *Research* [Institute], *Nexa* [merged with] Spectrum [*Holobyte* to] become *Sphere, [right*] after "Monopoly" was [*completed*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game was [developed] under the name *Sphere* - [not] *Nexa*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Boy! The -- [Ya know], the *music* [in] "Alf" [really drives] me *crazy*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *reminds* me of the *music* to "Takeshi no *Chosenjo*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One [interesting] moment* in "Alf" occurs when [you let him] stand still for a *sec*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He [will get irate with] you [and] strike a [bit] of Sonic-like attitude. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *"Alf"* [must] be one [of] the [worst] games we've seen on the Master *System*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As [an] *Adventure Game*, [it completely] *fails*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The puzzles [are incredibly] *lame*, the Action sequences are [absolutely] *terrible*, deaths [are] way too *frequent*, {and} the graphics [and] music are *ugly*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *This* [can] be [somewhat] *excused* by the [fact that] *developers* had [*relatively little experience*] in this area. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, the same [*cannot*] be said [about our] *next* game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Altered Beast 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Boss Theme" ♪ from "Fantasy Zone"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1989 [?] [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sega 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sega 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Our* [last] game [*today* is] a port of the *venerable* Arcade [*Beat*]-'em-Up, "Altered Beast". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This was [released] in the U.S. *early [to] mid*-[1988, before] the *Genesis* came [out] over *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, for unlucky *Sega* fans, who owned a *Master System*, this was the first *console* version they *saw*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As *we [can] see here*, [it] was [not] *pretty*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *As* a [reminder], "*Altered* Beast" [hit] Arcades in [1988]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was a *pre-"Renegade"*-style [Beat]-'em-*Up*, *meaning [that]* there was no depth [to] the *playing field*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Enemies came [at] you in a *conga* line [from both] *directions*, [just] like "Kung *Fu*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 What [differentiated it from] *similar* games [was the fact that] you could *smash* stone *blocks* [and] stuff [and it] had a really cool *power*-up system. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Killing the white wolves would drop an [*item* that] would *beef* you up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Collect *enough* [of] those [and you'll] be transformed [into], like, a half-man/half-[beast] *creature* [with] upgraded *attack* powers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Altered Beast*" was a simple [*repetitive] game - but* [it] looked cool and [it] handled [pretty] *well*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Master System "Altered Beast", however*, is an [unmitigated] *disaster*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess all those big sprites tax the [Master System's] C.P.U. [to] the [point] where the game barely *functioned*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Movement* is *incredibly* slow [and] jerky. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Everything feels like it's moving [in] slow *motion*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *frame rate* feels *really* low. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] when *moving*, you [and your] enemies are [animated with], like, just *two* sprites. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] there's [*quite*] a [bit] of *flicker* [as] well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *unlike* Sega's "Double *Dragon*", *Sega* was [not] able [to] add a [second] *player* option, so ya hafta go *solo* [on this]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *All these factors conspire* [to] make the game *much* more *difficult* [than] the *Arcade* version. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, "*Altered* Beast" was [pretty] cheap [to] *begin* with. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] the *Master* System *version* is [just] *impossible*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's *really* [difficult to react] *quickly* [and] with the [correct] *timing* when [you're] being *attacked* because, as I *mentioned*, the action is so *jerky*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*first] level* [of] the *Arcade* game is [not] very *tough* [and] the *[first] boss* is reasonably *simple*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *here* ya move so *sluggishly*, it's *hard* to avoid all those falling *heads*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, by *comparison*, here's the *Genesis* "Altered Beast". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] handles *much* more smoothly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Because* [it] controls [better and] the [hit detection] is much more *accurate*, the [*fight*] seems a [lot] *fairer*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Whereas] the *Master System*... Oh, [Good] Lord! It's [*just*] so *awful*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Anyway, we'll* do a quick tour [of] the *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your second Beast Form is a *dragon* which is *so huge* [and] *unwieldy* [that it's almost impossible to] avoid [getting hit] by the enemies [that] *surround* you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Thankfully*, this boss is [pretty] *easy*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya know, much [of] the [appeal] of the *Arcade* "Altered Beast" was the *presentation*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The enemies were *cool* [and] [exploded] nicely when ya *hit them*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your Beast Forms [and your] special *attacks* looked very *awesome*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here, [everything* has] been [downgraded to] the [point] of [complete] *lameness*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, *look* [at] the lightning bolts ya throw; [it's just not] very *cool*! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And *then* one entire level was dropped *entirely*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's the *3rd* Level - the *Tiger Man* level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Another* way the game has been [simplified is] you [*now only* hafta collect] *two* of the [White] Wolf *power*-ups [to] fully *transform*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You go [from] *Regular Guy* to *Super Buffed Guy* [to] *Beast*; there's [just] three *stages*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *one other* major headache is [this]: The [*Master System*] has [only] two [buttons]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, one is [used for] *Punching* {and} the other [for] *Kicking*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, how [do ya] *jump*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Press *Up*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Nope*! [That] would make *sense*, [but] you press both [buttons at] *once*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Or, [to] do a *high* jump, you hit *Up* [and] both [buttons] *simultaneously*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This makes [certain], uh, *encounters*, like the *final* boss, very *difficult*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He *keeps charging* you (he's a *rhino*, you understand). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And you need] to *attack* [and] then *quickly* jump [and perform] a *charging* attack [while] in midair so you fly ov... -- [above] his *head*, then land, [and] then [*repeat*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And he] *takes*, like, *[20 hits* to] *kill*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you fail [to correctly] jump *over* him [he'll] slam [you] in the corner [and] pound ya until ya *die*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, one mistake or [mistimed] jump [can] mean *[certain] death*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the *finger*-twisting *control* scheme is a real frickin' *pain*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Even* the *ending* has been lamed down from the Arcade version. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *really, everything* [about] the Master System, ah, "Altered *Beast*" is [just] *really terrible*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's one [of] the *least* playable games on the *system*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe you've played the *Genesis* game [and didn't] *like it*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, *try this one* [and] the Genesis "Altered Beast" [will] seem like [an] amazing work of genius. 🍇🍌
