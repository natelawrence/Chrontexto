👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 36 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hi everyone, "...Episode 36" is a little late, but here it is, covering September October '88 - which means we've finally reached the Japanese release date for the big one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! The big kahuna of the Nintendo Entertainment System - Shigeru Miyamoto's 8-bit masterpiece - a game that set the standard for the Platforming genre. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, we've got a bunch of crap and another little-respected U.S. publisher makes its debut. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But some of this stuff is [pretty] weird and interesting, even if it's not very good. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, let's move on. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Donald Duck 🇯🇵 // Snoopy's Silly Sports Spectacular 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 22 🇯🇵 // 1990 April [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Kemco | Novotrade 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, let's kick this off with a rather off-the-wall animated intro in which New York City and the Roman Colosseum are floating in the clouds. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Donald Duck pilots a small airplane between them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Hey, why doesn't he just fly from one cloud to the other? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, he's a duck, right?). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Donald Duck" is a Disney game from Kemco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the Japanese rights for Disney characters passed from Hudson to Kemco, and then later ended up with Capcom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember the Kemco 'Bugs Bunny: Crazy Castle' games on the Game Boy? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first few were actually 'Mickey Mouse' games in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, "Donald Duck" is a short little "Track & Field"-style minigame collection. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 First up is Sack Race. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Where are we anyway? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, Naples already Sicily. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That volcano in the background looks kind of like Mount Etna to me. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Daisy Duck looks really unhappy for some reason in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 She does not want to be Sack Racing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then here we have boot throwing in Rome. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like the hammer throwing track and pill to you have to move around your thumb on the D-Pad. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and don't forget pogo stick hurdles at the Roman Forum. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This event really bites. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know why it's so damn hard to jobos things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You always either hit the front of the wall or you hit the top, just as you're jumping over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And now we're in front of the castle San Angelo pole vaulting over the Tiber River. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is just like the pole vaulting and "Track & Field" when the timing is much fuzzier and you land in the river most of the time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nice parallax scrolling, however, or I guess, fake parallax scrolling. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now we move on to Pisa for the pizza carrying event, pizza and pizza. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Get it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, these actually look like donuts to me. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Totally pointless event that involves simply moving very slowly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I love this event, you're on a boat in the Grand Canal trying to push too. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They're off the boat in the water. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And once again, look at Daisy space. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like being in this game has robbed her of the will to live. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Donald Duck" was [only] released in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I can hear you saying, 'I've seen this before somewhere.'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's because in the U.S. Kemco released it as "Snoopy's Sports Spectacular". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Though the title screen simply calls it "Snoopy".) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's really just the same game with different sprites. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, despite peanuts being really popular and the characters appearing on every single kind of merchandise. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't really see many pins, video games now do you? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though Kemco did release a few Snoopy games on the Game Boy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, in conclusion, this is a silly little collection of minigames, which looks [pretty] lame compared to "Track & Field II", which was released just about one week before this one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 8 Eye's 🇯🇵 // 8 Eyes 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 27 🇯🇵 // 1990 January [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Thinking Rabbit 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Seta 🇯🇵 // Taxan 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's "8 Eye's". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the title screen is what we call a greengrocers apostrophe. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The unnecessary apostrophe originated in Japanese version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess that's understandable. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But it wasn't changed for the U.S. release, except on the cover art. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was fixed, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we start off here; we're going to get a "Mega Man"-like stage selection screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can start on any level except the final level, the house of Ruth. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (A rather unfortunate name choice since in the United States, the house of booth is a nonprofit organization for battered women.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or actually has a [pretty] good jumping animation (relatively detailed). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "8 Eye's" greatly resembles "Castlevania" now, doesn't it? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or is a bit like Simon Belmont, except he has a teeny weeny short little dagger instead of a big long whip. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing Simon Belmont didn't have is a hawk (or is it a falcon? [It's] hard to say.). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Hawk's name is Cutlass and is good for hitting certain enemies or switches on walls that you can't otherwise reach. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy, for example, your dagger does no damage you have to use the hawk to attack him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the thing, though, and the regular 1-Player mode you don't actually control Congress directly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 His replies back and forth by himself, though you can make him before a diving attack. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I actually used a Special Weapon there that was that white thing rolling around on the ground? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, there are Special Weapons as well as hidden items in the walls. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here's the incredibly boring looking boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm gonna use my freeze weapon on him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And one cool thing about "8 Eye's" are these crazy between level cutscenes where a skeleton waiter serves you with a box of refreshments? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess this is like a weird Brechtian distancing technique type gag, showing the actors between the takes kind of like "Castlevania" did with its closing credits. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With "Castlevania" noid you With this Medusa heads prepared to go full ballistic on "8 Eye's", because there are all kinds of crazy flying or jumping enemies that often move in strange hard-to-hit patterns. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 To make matters worse, your weapon has almost no range. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's much shorter than belmonts whip. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And most enemies weapons have a longer range than your dagger. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 To hit an enemy need to watch the attack patterns and sneak in and get a hit in know when they have their weapon drawn back. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's a clever part you have to use contrast accurate that wall switch while you stand by the door and then run in real quick. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So despite "8 Eye's" similarity the "Castlevania" is for a fall short of Konami's game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It suffers from a, sort of, visual monotony. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Castlevania" starts to offer this great huge long haul of giant pillars and Windows. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There was a great sense of atmosphere in that game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He had this enormous decaying castle with bridges, towers, all kinds of stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "8 Eye's" however, just seems to be a series of boring rooms connected by stairways. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At least that's the impression I get from what I played. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's really not much variety in the level designs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It feels very repetitive. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On the positive side, it has a really good music and a lot of it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each level has about three different musical themes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The critical opinion on AI seems [pretty] mixed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 On MobyGames, the critics reviews range from 0 to 100 on a scale of 100. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It certainly has its fans and some folks haven't felt better than "Castlevania". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess I'd like "8 Eye's", okay, but the whole Falcon thing doesn't really work that well (at least in the 1-Player version). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For 2 Players, the second player controls the Falcon, though that person honestly gets stuck with a crappy job. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, there's really not a whole lot of Special Weapons ammo are the Special Weapons just suck up way too much ammo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can use your freeze ball [only] like maybe three or four times and then you'll be out of ammo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "8 Eye's" was made by Thinking Rabbit who are mostly known for "Sokoban". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I really wish I liked "8 Eye's" better than I did. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems like a technically well-made game that didn't quite hit its mark. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess my recommendation is try it, and maybe you'll like it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 27 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Atlus 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, this certainly looks like a Namco game, based solely on the title screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It has that rainbow effect going on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the whole thing, sort of, fits in with the title screens of their 'Family Sports' Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namco seems to like a certain amount of consistency and their releases, by the way, would number them on the boxes? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, this is another Adventure Game, "Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken" (or Erica Toros dream adventure), starring Erica Anson Tarou, who I guess are twins and their adventure is about them going into a magical ferrying dreamland of some sort. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game's intro (which is very nicely done, by the way), has this, sort of, ethereal dreaming music going on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Shows the kids following this mysterious cat like creature into the dream world. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Basically, it's a lot like "Alice in Wonderland". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game was developed by Atlas. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If nothing else, Atlas made games that look good (nice effect with the wind blowing the leaves there.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Erika to Satoru..." eschews the typical list of commands running down the right-hand side, and instead have some icons down in the bottom right corner. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (Move, look, talk, inventory, take, and so on). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, the unusual thing about this game is that it's for 2 Players. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the 2-Player mode, one player controls Erica and the other Satoru. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each has their own individual screen up at top. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In 1-Player mode, you control both and switch back and forth to the to using the Select button. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Often both characters will be in the same location at the same time or interact with N.P.C.s. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally their quiz segments. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm being asked a question here about Kodiak bears. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is mostly the usual talk pick up items use items, you know that style of gameplay we've seen before. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And despite the unusual 2-Player mode, Erica Tose Toro has achieved notoriety for one particular thing, a hidden message put in by one of the programmers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The message can be accessed by completing the game, waiting a long time, and then entering an arcane series of button presses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game will actually then play some music from LJN's and "Karate Kid", also developed by Atlas. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It will then display a rather long message in which the programmer both compliments and complaints about various coworkers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's a little bit as Translated by Kevin Gifford a manga weasel and I heart P.C. Engine. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First off, Kuru Agoura who ran off with some guy in the middle of the project. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, you bastard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Don't show up at the office without showering after having sex six times the previous night. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next Tetsuya Ohashi. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes you You bastard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Don't give me your flippin s---. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Come in late on the day we should put the wrong like nothing's missed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can bring me all the porn you want. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not forgetting that one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All that fucking weight you put on the wonder you paid out 18,000 yen still got nothing but a kiss out of it. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kenji Tucano Namco debugger, you're a part timer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Don't dig around on my project planner. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And finally, kiyohara go to the biggest thorn in my side in this project. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, you You bastard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing at a time machine I'm sending you back to the Edo period. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Go do your riddles over, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Supposedly a leura bility he accused of not showering after sex once the same person who program those minigame segments in "Karate Kid". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He also was praised for various people, including okaasan, probably cosy Okada, founder of Atlas. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No he had I know all about your own normal tendencies, whatever exactly that means. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is gonna be one of the greatest video game easter eggs of all time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game itself however is [pretty] much forgotten. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Knight Rider 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 30 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Pack-in-Video 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pack-in-Video 🇯🇵 // Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Whoa look at all that copyright and licensing information! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 From Pack In Video it's "Knight Rider", naturally released in the U.S. by schlock-meisters, Acclaim. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we see kitten Michael wearing his skinny jeans (that stupid hipster). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The introductory cutscene sets up the game's plot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Michaels bitching about having to end his vacation early just because terrorists stole some stupid top secret military weapons, including the P.I.V. bomb. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The P.I.V. bomb? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, "Knight Rider" is an early example of the Solid Snake style of dialogue writing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's up to you to chase down these terrorists. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see by the map, you'll be driving all over the country. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But first, you need to power-up Kitt. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At the beginning of each level, you get one attribute point to spend. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's, sort of, like a Driving R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll start with a shield because that sounds important. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The lasers and missiles aren't really needed this early in the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now it should be mentioned: 🍇
🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite the fact that we've seen numerous Nintendo games with speech samples and despite the fact the main appeal of 'Knight Rider' is a talking car, Kitt does not actually talk in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're on the road after terrorists - terrorists so well organized, armed and plentiful they just attacked and looted an Army base. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, you should be able to take them on all by yourself because you have a talking car with a machine gun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 (When you see those red cars, those are the terrorists cars by the way.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh and look, here's an upgrade van, just like in "Spy Hunter". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Knight Rider" is sorta like a remake of "Spy Hunter", in a way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is basically a timed race. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to get to the end before your fuel or time runs out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you get into a boss battle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's not too bad if you just sort of try to stay on the side and hit him while avoiding his shots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you lose your shields completely, then you'll die. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point, you might think it's screwed up and killed quickly enough. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But no, it's a scripted event. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He always gets away. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For the second stretch, ya, chase the terrorists to Seattle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now probably you all know what Knight Rider is, but if not well, it was a T.V. show that ran from 1982 to 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that starred a crime-fighting talking car, called Kitt. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, David Hasselhoff is in the show for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it had been off the air for a couple of years when this game came out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I know what you're thinking - that I'm going to make some cracks about how this must've been popular in Germany, because David Hasselhoff is huge over there or something,. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I'll let you in on a little secret. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, Hasselhoff had a recording career in Europe. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But in reality he's just a smokescreen to distract us from the even more embarrassing stuff that was really popular back then. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, The Kelly Family. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was a bunch of New England hippies who moved to Europe back in the '70s, and made all our kids dress and funny outfits, and then became huge in Germany, Benelux, Switzerland and those places. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know how many albums these guys sold? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 20 million! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they played, like, huge arenas! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I have to admire their dedicated uncoolness - like this album cover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When do you think this came out? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'I don't know, Dr. Sparkle. Maybe '76 - '77?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Try 1997. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, while you were listening to "OK Computer" or somethin', this was flying off the shelves in German-speaking countries. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, sorry for going off like that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, there was actually an earlier "Knight Rider" game - a Computer Game from Ocean, which does look a lot like the N.E.S. game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, they appear to be officially different games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, I mean, what else is a 'Knight Rider' game going to look like, other than you driving around, inside Kitt, shooting stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so we're headed to Seattle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you see those yellow cars, you should shoot 'em, because they'll drop something like a time limit increase, fuel, shield refill, or missiles and laser weapons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't really need to shoot the red cars, since they do absolutely nothing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's probably easier and safer just to drive around 'em. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you find the damn truck again and that's off to Salt Lake. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bonnie is [pretty] rude to ya, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 She cast aspersions on your driving abilities. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's funny, "Knight Rider" is sorta a crappy cash-in game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I do like the multiple encounters with a terrorist truck. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It escapes twice and then the third thing you encounter if you finally get to blow it up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It gives you a feeling of satisfaction like killing Bowser in "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this is definitely not a great game, but I ended up liking it more than I thought I would. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Viva Las Vegas 🇯🇵 // Vegas Dream 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 September 30 🇯🇵 // 1990 March [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by HAL Laboratory 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Epic Records | CBS/Sony Group Inc. 🇯🇵 // HAL America 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're about ready to close out September 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last Japanese game released that month was "Viva Las Vegas". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Man! that's one ugly version of the U.S. flag! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Published by Epic/Sony, the record company, who also released a handful of other FamiCom games so far, but developed by HAL, who released this game themselves in the U.S. as "Vegas Dream". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The cool little intro shows the shadowy gamblers' airplane taking off and then approaching the glittering desert hellhole that is Las Vegas. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyone out there who's from Las Vegas? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just kidding Vegas isn't really that bad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But what is bad is the paint job on the airplane's interior. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 My god! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who'd actually decorated an airplane Kevin like that? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah, here's the Vegas skyline. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The stage select screen gives you a view of the Vegas Strip. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 See, even though these early games were not exactly fantastic, they put some extra effort into them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you pick your name. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (I'm going to be 'Mr. Sparkle' this time.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you choose your game; you have the choice of four different games, altogether. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here's a hot tip: Start off by choosing Slots. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The jackpot bar game seems to be deliberately broken in order to allow you to build a decent bankroll [pretty] quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just keep putting money in and you're almost guaranteed to make quite a bit of money back. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The odds are really in your favor (unlike, you know, real slot machines). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 All let's keep going 50 bucks each time I finally win somthing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seems like you usually get a jackpot, like every (oh, I don't know...) five or six tries. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the security guard is always impressed when you win. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can go from 700 to several thousand dollars, like literally a matter of minutes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then that's when things will start getting interesting. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Certain events will happen during "Vegas Dream". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This person will come up to you and offer you something, such as a unique gambling event. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy will play one round of Roulette with you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, the odds are 50/50. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you lose, he'll be dismissive of your gambling skills. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you win, he'll say, 'Wow, you're better than I expected!'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, better!? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We just bet on red or black at Roulette. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's pure luck! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [That] doesn't mean you're a good gambler if you somehow win. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not to make gross generalizations, but is that like an Asian thing? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you've ever seen Chinese movies like "God of Gamblers" or that sort of thing, they always depict great gamblers as being impossibly lucky. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They just somehow always manage to get, like, a perfect poker hand every time (as if luck or some kind of acquired skill that gamblers can work on perfecting). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, speaking of luck, I found it hard to win at Blackjack. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The dealer seems to always get 20. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe this is just a coincidence but I played like 10 hands of Blackjack on this and they came up with 20s, like, six or seven times. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know; maybe HAL programmed it this way on purpose. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll try this again. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I got 20 this time! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the dealer... gets 20 as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now not all events are gambling-based. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can win or lose money in situations like this where you're offered to go see a Vegas show. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll either win the lottery or have your mind stolen by the lady escorting you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Does Vegas even have shows like this anymore? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nowadays, Vegas mostly seems to be the place where old musical acts and comedians go to die. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya see all these billboards in Vegas and you're like, 'Geez! Carrot Top is still around?'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I love the fact that things like someone winning some money in a raffle or someone getting conned out of $200 makes the top of the evening news, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than 21 and Slots there's Roulette and (worst of all) Keno. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Avoid Keno like the plague. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's funny; ever since the dawn of the video game, people have been making gambling games like this, and I'm really not sure why. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess some people like gambling and don't want to worry about losing real money. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose this is the best gambling game we've seen, so far (I mean, not that there's that much competition). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's certainly more fun than those Pachinko games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But at least HAL added some additional content like the various N.P.C.s that you interact with. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I guess the game [pretty] much succeeds at what it's trying to do. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jeopardy! 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sharedata | Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Game Tek 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's it for September, Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But what's this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Jeopardy!" the video game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Released in the U.S. in September 1988 by GameTek, who has the honor of being the fourth U.S.-based publisher to emerge for the console (after LJN, Acclaim, and Tengen). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, this game never had a Japanese release and it was aimed squarely at the U.S. market. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was developed by guns-for-hire, Rare. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a stock market ticker along the bottom giving you all the copyright info (in case you missed it on the title screen). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you choose the number of players (up to three), difficulty, name, choose your on-screen character representation and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This music reminds me a lot of Led Zeppelin's "Cashmere" - it has the same sort of rhythm. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You get to choose between a few goofy-lookin' characters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess I'll pick the guy with the way-too-short tie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, a few different male characters as well as female characters. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the game starts, ya pick a category, dollar amount, and press the D-Pad to ring the buzzer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the fun part - use your D-Pad to type out an answer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh boy, that's a lot of work! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is like when you set up your Xbox 360 and you're creating your username and password and setting up the router and all that kind of stuff. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a whole game of that, basically. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The fact that you have to type in all these answers leads to an obvious problem, namely spelling. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everyone knows the answer is Pharaoh. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But does everyone know how to spell Pharaoh? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is it O-A-H or A-O-H? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In real life 'Jeopardy!', contestants get a lot of leeway when they're writing down answers for Final Jeopardy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But here not so much. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, [pretty] much none at all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there is at least one spelling error in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I got the wrong answer about the song Waltzing Matilda based on the spelling of Matilda because I didn't spell it with an H. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the song itself spelled Matilda without the H. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, rather sloppy work, Rare. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One weird thing: When a computer-controlled contestant doesn't doesn't have a correct answer, they'll just type in a bunch of gibberish. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jeopardy is more or less a part of the existing Jeopardy Computer Game by Share Data. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game's layout and some of the characters are all based on the earlier Computer Game versions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The electronic game rights to Jeopardy were owned by a company called I.J.E.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They licensed the rights to Share Data, but then a little bit later created GameTek to release console games, many of which were based on the game shows that they owned electronic rights to. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's another question I really don't like. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since Robert Fitsooth (assuming he was even a real person) was definitely not Robin Hood in real life. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Many of the questions are [pretty] easy, but some are definitely dated - like these questions about '80s T.V. shows. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, does anyone really remember 'Simon & Simon', nowadays? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Final Jeopardy can be a bit awkward as, when you're playing with other people, you actually have to look away or close your eyes while the others are typing in their answers... and their wagers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since wagers and answers are introduced two times, I guess you have to close your eyes twice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Undoubtedly, many accusations of cheating arose when playing Final Jeopardy, back then. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose the main problem is simply that the N.E.S. isn't a very good platform for this sorta game, due to all the typing required. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there are far more playable versions of Jeopardy available, nowadays. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So unfortunately, history is not really been kind to this one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Wheel of Fortune 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sharedata | Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Game Tek 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh s--- I accidentally load up same game twice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, wait a sec, this isn't "Jeopardy!"; it's Wheel of Fortune. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [Pretty] nice sounding speech sample, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep another Merv Griffin produced game show gets converted into video game format by Rare and GameTek. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game options are quite similar to "Jeopardy!". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have number of players, enter your name... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though the players are all off camera, so there is no goofy player avatars, like in "Jeopardy!". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might [have] noticed that both "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel...", you choose the number of real people playing first. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then you choose whether you want to play against the CPU. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So what happens if you choose one player and don't want to play against the CPU? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, then you're the [only] contestant and it's always your turn. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I guess you automatically win every game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Wheel of Fortune" is basically Hangman, with an element of chance added in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The amount of money that you get for correctly guessing letters is based on what you get when you spin the Wheel of Fortune. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, a contestant doesn't lose their turn until they guess a wrong letter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So lucky contestant could win a round without other players ever even getting a turn. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know if there's something in this game to prevent that from happening. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I thought I was going to lose this round without ever getting a chance to spin. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But suddenly the other players both ended their turns by making really bad guesses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the C.P.U. will deliberately guess incorrect letters after a certain number of correct guesses. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As with "Jeopardy!", this was originally a Computer Game by Share Data. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Much of the N.E.S.' version's game design was borrowed from the earlier game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're now on to the Speed Round, where every player guesses one letter and then tries to solve (no spinning each round). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think this type of round occurs when there's not enough time to do a regular round, like near the end of the episode. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm going to assume this is the [only] reference to Norman Mailer ever made in a Nintendo Entertainment System game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But if you know of another one, go ahead and leave a message on the web zone. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Wheel of Fortune" appears to be aimed at adults as well as kids. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, how is any eight year old gonna be able to guess this answer? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I can win a new Porsche! Nice! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting they use the name of a real car, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe Porsche was a sponsor Wheel of Fortune? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Or maybe Rare just slipped it in and no one cared or noticed. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The very last round is where you pick five consonants and one vowel, and then try to guess the answer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here's the thing, I figured out the answer, but in my excitement, I typed in the wrong letter. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I didn't notice it at first! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can't go back and change just one letter. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The back arrow will like erase everything as you go backwards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I had to make the correction and then retype all the letters afterwards. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess it was so nervous because I really wanted that new Porsche that I ran out of time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Something that really wouldn't be much of an issue on the Computer version, or on the D.S. where I guess you could, like, pick out letters with a stylus, or in real life where you could just say the answer. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, much like "Jeopardy!", there's nothing really wrong with the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Other than fact that the Control Pad is not really the ideal input for word-based games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Daisenryaku 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 11 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Systemsoft | Quest 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bothtec 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 How about... a Military Simulation Game? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But wait, it's not just any old Military Game but the granddaddy of Japanese Military Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The name is just about impossible for Westerners to pronounce because [of] that weird R-Y sound, so I'll approximate it as 'Dyson-yakou' ('Great War Strategy'). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I like the trippy minimalistic music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] kinda reminds people Akeem right cool music. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The 'Daisenryaku' games are, sort of, hardcore Military Games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These are the names of actual jets; maybe even the stats are accurate. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In "FamiCom Wars" the units are just called 'bomber' or 'fighter', whereas in this game I guess they're going for verisimilitude. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was [only] released in Japan, but we do have a [pretty] smooth translation from Aeon Genesis. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will, sort of, make things go a bit easier for us. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 First thing we notice: a lot of campaigns - 30! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (That's a lot for back then!). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can choose who plays each color. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can even make the C.P.U. play both if you want to watch the FamiCom play itself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I chose blue - apparently a mistake, since red starts off with four buildings to blue's one, so I was sorta screwed from the get-go. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can alternate between the entire map and, like, the close-up view where you actually move your units. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You start with no units. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the first thing to do is to actually produce some. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The buildings make ground units and the airbases make air units (obviously). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But jets and things are really expensive! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, you have to, sort of, stick with ground units (at least at first). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also have to remember what all the names mean. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise, you'll be thinkin' you wanna make a tank and, uh... which one of these is a tank, again? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing that tripped me up at first was simply moving the cursor around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hitting up or down on the D-Pad does nothing on the main screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I had to back up to the map and then move my cursor in zoom in. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, I learned that in order to move vertically, you need to use the diagonals on the D-Pad, since there's no square directly above you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This makes sense but it feels clunky and slow when you're playing the game and trying to move around. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you have to press the diagonals perfectly otherwise it won't register anything at all. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now the 'Daisenryaku' series was created by a company called SystemSoft, originally on Japanese computers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [The] first game came out on the P.C.-88, ...-98, FM-7, and so on, back in 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It must have been successful because SystemSoft started pumping these things out at an incredible rate! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the P.C.-88 version of the first game, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Numerous sequels and remakes came out in the late-'80s/early-'90s on various computers, and a few made it to consoles as well, like "Advanced Daisenryaku" for the Genesis. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The basic formula didn't really change that much. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the few to make it out of Japan was a "World Advanced Daisenryaku". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (They just keep adding more words to the titles.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was a Sega Saturn game and it was called "Iron Storm" in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 By this time, fancy 3D graphics were used in battles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, the series continues to this day. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original Computer Games all used hexagonal shapes on the map (as wargames traditionally have) but this version uses squares. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess the FamiCom was not capable of, uh, hex-shaped background tiles or something. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, I suppose it works; it just looks funny and is difficult to move vertically. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So why should you play the FamiCom "Daisenryaku" today? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It comes across as a less slick version of "FamiCom Wars". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I know that "FamiCom Wars" was merely following the template already set by the computer 'Daisenryaku' games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe this is more challenging than "FamiCom Wars"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of the maps (like the later ones) are just huge! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, all in all, this whole sorta like "Hydlide" (an important game that got ported to the FamiCom just a little too late). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose that if you get all geeky over military specs, you might want to give this a try. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 The Black Bass II 🇯🇵 // The Black Bass 🇺🇸 ✨

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 18 🇯🇵 // 1989 September [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Another 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hot-B 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, it's another '...Black Bass' game, "...Black Bass II" in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That very well could be a picture of a bass, but it's certainly not black! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's more like, uh, blue! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Still, it is a hell of a lot nicer looking than the title art for "Black Bass (I)". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, geez! Why is that fish wearing a stereotypical pimp suit? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that music helped get the first "...Black Bass" onto the 'Chrontendo' "Worst 10" list. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Luckily, the sequel was better and even better release in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here it was known as "...Black Bass U.S.A." on the title screen, or just "The Black Bass" on the box art. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It also had a less interesting cover. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese box had a surprised-looking kid holding a fish while water poured out of the T.V. screen, flooding his house. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The box art sorta promises a level of realism the game can't really produce, however. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, you sail out onto the lake and pick a spot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some spots have plentiful bass and others do not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's a rather simple Power Meter (kinda like the one in most Golf Games and "Wheel of Fortune" when you spend the wheel). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ya cast your line, then you sorta wiggle around the lure to attract the attention of some fish. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, a fish might just bite, then you reel it in, holding down on the button. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Basically, hold the button down for a few seconds until a ting-ting-ting noise is made. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Release the button or your line will break. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After a few minutes, the fish will be sorta worn down and the red image of the fish will, sort of, uh, be transformed to a fish skeleton, but the fish can get away or the line can break. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you have successfully worn down the fish, you can then reel it in all the way. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, I got a rainbow trout - a good fish, I suppose, but in order to win the tournament, you have to catch bass. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The manual actually tells you where to find the best spot sorta the first couple lakes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After that, you have to find 'em, yourself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, you, sort of, need to take into consideration the time of day when choosing a lure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But... really the game is not that complicated. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose the problem with "...Black Bass..." (and Fishing Games in general) is that they're sorta boring! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All you do is catch the same fish over and over again. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In real life, fishing is not exactly a super exciting sport. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's more like an excuse to sorta get away from it all, drink a few beers, relax, and you get to eat any fish you catch. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This video game doesn't really offer any of that. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Cobra Command 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 21 🇯🇵 // 1988 November [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Data East 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Data East 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wow! That is one fast helicopter! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's, like, parting the ocean! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Right, so it's "Cobra Command" from Data East - Data East being a company that has given us a lot of heartbreak to the refusal to stop making terrible games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I feel they have a lot of potential. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I really like "Karnov", but this game is a different story - another quickie game that seems aimed at the U.S. market. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, we're rescuing hostages in Sumatra, of all places! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game seems to take place around Indonesia. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, when we start the game up, we see that it's a "Choplifter" clone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might recall "Choplifter" being the old American Computer Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It looked basically just like this. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you go around shooting stuff, picking up the occasional hostage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here's the weird thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Cobra Command" was originally an Arcade Game - a LaserDisc Arcade Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Remember those? (Like "Dragon's Lair"?). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's got all this fancy animation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, you have to love the huge disparity between the actual animation and the pre-recorded sound. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then the computer generated cockpit and sound effects, which sound absolutely horrible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Cobra Command" was by the same guy who did "Road Avenger" (which I think is probably a slightly better remembered LaserDisc game). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This later received ports on the Sega C.D. and the Saturn and the PlayStation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So anyway, the 8-Bit "Cobra Command" might just be about the least faithful Arcade port ever. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's really nothing like the original (other than the helicopter theme). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't even know why they called it "Cobra Command"! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A lot of the action takes place in these underground bases. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably really not a good idea to take helicopter in there, because it actually blows up real easily! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What!? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That looked like part of the background, but apparently it was an obstacle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You may have noticed something really strange about this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you move forward, the screen stops scrolling for a sec, and you end up being at the very edge of the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why did they do this? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This makes it much more difficult to dodge enemy fire. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to evade bullets and whatnot by moving up and down. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the thing is, the vertical controls aren't that hot either. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like here: Why can't I hit that damned yellow panel? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I tap Up: the 'copters too high. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tap Down: now it's too low. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In other words, I really hate this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I looked at the walkthrough on this game to see if there's any way of getting around being stuck on the edge of the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the fix given is: Just fly backwards instead of forwards (which apparently works). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, thanks Data East for making a Helicopter Game where you have to fly a helicopter in reverse. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Did I mention how useless the missiles are? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unless you're right in front of the target, they'll, like, always miss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently you can get weapons upgrades later (like homing missiles or something). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But really, anyone who can play this game enough to get to that point really has to have the patience of a saint, and I'm not that person. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Genpei Toumaden: Computer Boardgame 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, here's another weird one for ya, "Genpei Toumaden: Computer Boardgame". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Right off the bat, the name is weird, since this isn't a Board Game-style video game (like that 'Game of Life' on the P.C. Engine). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, this is actually a, sort of, R.P.G.-type thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no rolling dice or cards or any of that sorta thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Wikipedia says that Namco released an actual Board Game, based on this, prior to the video game coming out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I couldn't find any real confirmation of that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, in the intro, we see the Japanese Imperial regalia (or at least the regalia as are comm[only] depicted). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No one knows what they really looked like, since they are so sacred, [only] the Emperor could look at them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Genpei Toumaden..."'s main character is based on historical figure, but not a Sengoku Era person. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, he was from the Genpei War era, killed at the Battle of Dan Noura. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Genpei War was a 12th century conflict between Japan's two major clans, Taira and the Menamotos (also called the Haika and the Genjis - as in "Tale of the Genji"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The war ended with Menamotos winning and the head of the clan becoming the first Shogun. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first 'Genpei Toumaden...' game came out in arcades in 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A very unusual game, in that it alternated between normal side-scrolling Hack-'n'-Slash and a 'Big Mode' (where you became a giant multi sprite figure) and top-down Action. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Apparently, the story behind the game is that you are out to get revenge on the head of the Menamoto clan and retrieve the Imperial regalia. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When covering Konami's "Getsufuu Maden", we noticed some interesting similarities between the two games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, when it came time to port this thing to FamiCom, Namco completely redesigned it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess that it ties with "Cobra Command" as one of the most substantially altered home version of any game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's now a turn-based R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though oddly enough, the overworld layout, sort of, resembles that and "Getsufuu Maden". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can see enemies on the overworld. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (That little vortex thing will drop them, from time to time.) 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like in the Arcade Game, health is depicted as a series of candles that burn down as you take damage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you kill monsters, you collect Gold and Toku (or virtue). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In terms of items, the [only] thing I've seen in this game were scrolls. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 When facing enemies, your main options are attack and use a scroll (or you can try to run). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, at least from what I've seen, there's really no fancy strategy involved in battles. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's all [pretty] simple. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enemies tend to be a variety of monsters and Yokai-type creatures. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The scrolls can heal you or they can do damage to monsters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll select one here and attack a monster with it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It does a fair bit of damage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Stopping at these stones will refill your health. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It costs money to do so, but you can refill as little or as much of your health as you want. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's sorta like filling up your gas tank. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Stopping by one of the Touri will light is spend some Toku on improving your stats. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing I've noticed: The numbers are actually in Japanese. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've upped my Power to 4 and the rest up to 2. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This cost about 200 Toku. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game will throw in a really tough enemy from time to time, resulting in a quick death. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you can be brought back to life at one of the Touri. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will, however, lose some Gold and Toku. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also in each level, there is a castle, in which you'll find a samurai boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you move on to another area. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we're going to need to use a healing scroll, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So once you defeated this guy, you'll come across the big map of Japan in a manner that's very similar to "Kenseiden" on the Master System. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, "Genpei Toumaden..." is definitely one of the most Japanese games we've seen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's based on Japanese history and mythology. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's no English text at all in the game (right down to the numbers). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, another 'Genpei Toumaden' game come out on the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this one *was* released in the U.S. as "Samurai Ghost". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's even out on the Virtual Console! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As for the FamiCom "Genpei Toumaden...", I'm gonna predict it's gonna remain completely unknown outside of Japan. 🍇🍌

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just when we thought we're gonna get an episode free of FamiCom Disk System games, here we are. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dandy" published by Pony Canyon - but note the Activision credit on the screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I'm not 100% sure how Activision was involved in this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's a really horrible logo, in my opinion, with the weird A and Y (a little hard to read). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it looks like you're going to be fighting a giant spider, at some point in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, "Dandy" has tons of loading screens and whatnot, so I'll edit all those out, as usual. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably the first thing you'll notice is that, 'Damn, this is one ugly game!'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our young hero here leaves home, talks to his family, finds an item in a chest... 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dandy" would probably be classified as an Action R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe you can think of it as a super crappy version of Falcom's "Ys". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though it does use "...Zelda"-style screens.? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we are battling some slimes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing ya might wonder is, 'What's all that black stuff around the edges that you can't cross over?'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ooh! Now we have some Cobras! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This really is one very unpleasant-looking game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here's the thing: While this is not very interesting, the backstory is actually quite fascinating. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Dandy" first saw the light of day as a game by John Pavlovich for Atari 8-bit computers. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a Dungeon Crawler for up to four players, in which you battle hordes of monsters. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If that sounds familiar, then yes, this does appear to be the inspiration for "Gauntlet", though "Gauntlet" was from Atari Games, not Atari Corporation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then a little later, Electric Dreams released a highly altered version for the Spectrum, CPC, and Commodore 64. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Supposedly, this version was developed by a company called RamJam. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (That's a really terrible name for a game company, right there.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Upon release, it was generally dismissed as being a terrible "Gauntlet" clone. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's certainly not a very pleasant-looking game either. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, I guess Pony Canyon licensed the rights from Activision? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I assume maybe they somehow owned the international rights? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Activision did release some Electric Dreams games, outside the U.K., so presumably "Dandy" was one of the titles they acquired. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems this version was done by Atelier Double, who is also responsible for the FamiCom "Ultima" and "Winter Games". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess they specialized in cheap-looking ports of American Computer Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now that it's daytime, we can see that black stuff was actually water. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, "Dandy"'s a [pretty] screwy game with wonky hit detection, so it's not very pleasant to play. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once ya get into a dungeon, it actually starts resembling the original game a bit more, though I instantly got killed for some reason. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All in all, this is probably really not worth your time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 21 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Jaleco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another F.D.S. game, this time from Jaleco. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This one uses the old Jaleco logo. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What!!?? Another Helicopter Game? Hmm. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is "Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We just saw the 'Big Challenge' Judo Game a couple episodes ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And I thought 'Big Challenge' was gonna be all Sports Games, but I guess this is actually a Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we start by flying over the wilds of Missouri. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you see the supply trucks, those hold power-ups (or bombs). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Um... Try to shoot those, if you can. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll get the best power-up, here - the spread gun (kinda like in "Contra"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I call them 'power-ups', but they're really more of, like, a weapon change. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can even change back to the default peashooter, if you're not careful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you have a weapon, there doesn't really seem to be any way of actually upgrading that particular weapon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you get another one of the same weapon type, it doesn't really change anything (no way to improve its strength). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...Dogfight Spirit"'s one of those old-school games that enjoys throwing lots of fast moving hard-to-dodge enemies at you from all angles at all times. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ground enemies shoot lots of bullets at ya, and the peashooter is [pretty] useless. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if you're stuck with that this is more of a Dodging Game, rather than a Shooting Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fortunately ya have a shield that can take a bunch of hits and you have quite a few lives. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bosses are [pretty] lame (just a bunch of gunports, from what I've seen). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is kind of like the world's lamest Compile Shooter, giving it some super fast moving segments, like, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can shoot those ships and get better weapons or bombs. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But be careful, because it appears you can actually shoot the power-up capsule and destroy it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also, the capsules are very small and look all kinda similar to each other. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it's difficult to discern what exactly you're grabbing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On regular levels, I think the supply trucks are randomly placed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Which means they often appear very close to the edge of the screen and then drive off the screen immediately (before you have a chance to shoot 'em). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since you go back to the peashooter after you die and supply trucks don't appear very frequently, this is [pretty] frustrating. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think this level is supposed to represent Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "...Dogfight Spirit" is not the worst Shoot-'em-Up I've ever seen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, man! This is not that far from the bottom of the list. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ultraman Club: Chikyuu Dakkan Sakusen 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?] 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aw man! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is not even what I wanna have to deal with today. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another 'Ultraman' game, "Ultraman Club" from Bandai. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I love the way "Ban Ban" appears on one building and "Dai" appears on the other one. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the Stage Select screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's the usual kind [of] things. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's, like, Forest, Glacier (that's the ice level),... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole Stage Select thing makes it seem kinda "Mega Man"-ish, I guess. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, this is about what you'd expect it to be - a cash-in quickie video game, based on the T.V. show. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 While there wasn't actually an "Ultraman Club" T.V. show (as far as I know) there were several ultimate club games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, as far as I can tell, the concept is that they each contain, like, multiple characters from across the Ultraman series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, various Ultraman appear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However, once ya fire the game up, this is not a side-scrolling Action Game (like all the other 'Ultraman' games we've seen) but a "...Zelda"-ish turn-based R.P.G.-ish sorta thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The overworld looks [pretty] boring. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, as far as I know, there's no villages or... really not much in the way of N.P.C.s (or, at least, I didn't see anything like that). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably the [only] original thing about this game is the battle mechanic. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have a few different attacks but when you try to use one, a little crosshair will appear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you want to aim it on the monster's weak spot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you hit the enemy right in the weak spot, you'll see a little bandage appear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you've injured their weak spots, your attacks in that same spot will then do major damage. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Often you'll want to attack an area like the horns, or the weak underbelly on lizard-like creatures, noses, that sorta thing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hitting the weak point's really the key to killing enemies very quickly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 On top of the regular attacks are cool special attacks that do more damage (like the Blade attack or the special Ray-Beam attack). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These will kill the enemies more quickly but also expand Energy Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Energy functions as your Hit Points in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I assume the enemies are based off things from the T.V. shows but what the heck is that? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's like Ultraman on a cross? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's [pretty] weird! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't actually attack that guy, by the way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So as the game progresses, you'll find other Ultra dudes to join your party. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You get a party of three, I believe. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite the, sort of, interesting idea of the weak spots, "Ultraman Club" looks like a very simple, repetitive game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems all you do is walk around, fight enemies... until you reach the end [of] the level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, despite the fact that the battle screen looks kinda like that in "Dragon Quest", there really aren't that many similarities. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really, it doesn't seem to be anything to be excited about. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Mario Bros. 3 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 October 23 🇯🇵 // 1990 February 12 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊... 🍋 Mario! Mario! Mario! 🍋 Mario! Mario! Mario! 

✅🏮🍊Mario! Mario! Mario! 🍋 Mario! Mario! ...

👓🏮🍊- "Super Mario Bros. 3 U.S.A. Commercial"


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our final game is the big one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As a matter of fact, it's the biggest Nintendo Entertainment System game of all time - the one that every kid with a Nintendo was waiting for. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So big Nintendo even managed to get it promoted in a theatrical movie, "The Wizard". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The glimpse of the game just drove up anticipation even more. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "That's the Magic Flute! 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 Use it! Use it! 🍇
✅🏮🍋🍓 It opens the Warp!" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And you couldn't blame kids for being excited. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Super Mario Bros. 3" spent around two years in development. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then U.S. gamers had to wait almost a year and a half for a U.S. release. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 ([It] didn't come out over here until early 1990.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, being released at the height of Nintendo's domination in the video game market, it was the best-selling video game of all time, at 18 million copies (not counting games that came bundled with the hardware). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though eventually it got knocked out of first place by some Wii game or something. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the quality of the game exceeded [pretty] much everyone's expectations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It was undoubtedly a 'Super Mario' game (this looks like "Super Mario Bros.") 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But it was bigger, better looking, and just with tons more stuff added in. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Consider this: The original "Super Mario Bros." fit on a 320 kilobit cart. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It took a 3 megabit cart for "Super Mario Bros. 3" (plus some extra RAM). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, unlike "Super Mario... 2", this took place in the same universe as the original. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 All of the same enemies and Mario's techniques were back, plus a whole bunch of new stuff. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Part of the fun part of the first game were the various secrets and hidden parts. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And "Super Mario... 3" is even more packed with secrets; there's one on almost every level! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You could find hidden lives, special items, and hidden areas. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, speaking of items, Mario now has an inventory. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you can collect a variety of items beyond the old mushrooms, and fire flowers, and stars. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There is even a bit of non-linearity to the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Mario can now move around on an overworld and has [a] certain amount of freedom in the order he takes on the levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Most worlds have about six to nine regular levels and a fortress or two. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The final level is always a flying ship, belonging [to] one of the King Koopa's kids. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are no conventional enemies on this level, but instead a series of mounted cannons, flame throwers, and the like. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Once inside the ship, ya face one of Bowser's kids. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You simply need to stomp on their head [about] three times. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You then retrieve the magic wands, necessary to transform the King back to his human form. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The plot actually does not begin with Princess Peach being kidnapped (or rather, uh, "Princess Toadstool" as they called her, back then). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, um, he'd -- she eventually does get kidnapped by Bowser (or "King Koopa") at the end [of] the game, providing, sort of, a plot twist. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Princess actually sends you a letter, and an item at the end of each world. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are a number of really hard-to-obtain secrets. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, the white Mushroom Houses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They [only] appear if you obtain all the gold coins on certain levels (like this one here). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's [pretty] difficult to get to all the coins in this level; you have to make a wild jump and hit the very last coins, right before they turn back into solid blocks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have to be really quick. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another ultra secret is the Coin Ship. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It [only] appears when you get a certain coin/score combination. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 All the old enemies reappear with tons of bizarre new ones: moving blocks called Thwomps as well as ghosts (originally named Boo Diddly). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Another great Mario enemy making their debut here are the Dry Bones, and Chain Chomps, and Bob-ombs as well (from "Super Mario Bros. 2") appear. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A number of new elements, beyond just the standard platforming get introduced into the game (the moving spikes, for example). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Each fortress ends with a mini-Boss battle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These are relatively easy but as the game progresses you get to the things like icy floors and conveyor belts, making that boss battle a bit trickier. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, aside from all this, one of the really great things about "Super Mario... 3" is the way it's full of surprises! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first time you play this, it's full of what we call "Oh s---!" moments. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, in this level: First you get thrown backward by tornado (a bit surprising). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And a moment later, the sun actually swoops down out of the sky and starts attacking you! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In a later level, you'll find that some of the blocks actually come to life and jump on you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is constantly playing against our expectations. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After encountering something over and over again in games, it's suddenly different, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Super Mario... 3" is like the "I Wanna Be The Guy" of the 8-bit game era. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So let's step back a bit and ask ourselves, 'Why is this game so special? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 How is it different than, say, "Zelda II..."?'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, looking back at the history of Nintendo, they always had a bit of [an] odd attitude toward sequels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Take "Donkey Kong": a huge hit involving a guy running and jumping. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The sequel, "Donkey Kong Jr.", changes up quite a bit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Gameplay-wise it feels like a completely different game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The next game, "Donkey Kong 3" - well... other than the presence of Donkey Kong, it really bore no resemblance to the first two. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Or "Zelda II...", Nintendo felt the need to completely rework the formula, to the point where it's really entirely possible to love the first game but detest "Zelda II...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And "Super Mario Bros.": a whacked out sequel to just regular old "Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the Japanese sequel was really just a harder version of the same game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's more like a modern day ROM Hack than a true sequel. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But with "Super Mario... 3", Nintendo finally got the sequel business just right. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you loved the first game, everything from the first game was still here, and then a whole lot of new stuff was added on. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You're still stomping on koopas, dropping down pipes, getting lost in castles... 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It just strikes the perfect balance between nostalgia and innovation. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Donkey Kong Jr." didn't do this, "Zelda II..." certainly didn't do this, but "...Mario... 3" did and "Link to the Past" did. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Super Mario... 3" would provide the template for future Nintendo sequels (right up to the current 'Super Mario Galaxy' games). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Mario, himself, looks more like "Mario" in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Compare the sprites for "...Mario..."s "...1", "...2" and "...3". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 He looks about the same in "...Mario... 2" and "...3" (which makes sense, because remember the U.S. "...Mario... 2" came out about the same time as "...Mario... 3" did in Japan). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So how does "...Mario... 3" expand on "Super Mario Bros."? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, obviously new enemies, for one, like these guys who will quickly fire off a projectile at ya. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And each enemy has to be dealt with a little differently. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These guys' projectiles move differently than the Piranha Plants' fireballs, or the cannonballs, or the bullets, or the Hammer Bros. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As before, there are hidden vines that take you to secret parts of a level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But look at this! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You find a bunch of coins in the clouds, but then there's a bounce block that takes you to an even higher level of clouds and more coins! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the fact that you can now fly (with the Raccoon Tail) opens up many more possibilities for hidden areas in the clouds. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Underwater levels also become much more involved and complex. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The fact that you can now move both to the left and the right (not just to the right) means there's more hidden stuff, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The exit's to the right but head left instead and you'll find this pipe which will lead you to an underground chamber with a Frog Suit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 That's one of three suits in this game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It gives you much better control while swimming. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The other two are the Tanooki suit and the Hammer Brothers suit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's the fourth boss, Wendy O. Koopa. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In the U.S., the Koopa kids were named after either talk show hosts or musical figures, including people that are nearly forgotten today - like, uh, Morton Downey Jr. (an obnoxious T.V. talk show host) or Wendy O. Williams (of the gimmicky Punk band, the Plasmatics, who were [pretty] well-known at one time). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, things start to get crazy in World 5 (Sky Land). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your path on the overworld appears to dead end into this Ziggurat, but once you get to the top, you'll find a vine and a pipe that leads up into the air. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then the second part of the world is up in the clouds, with the ground visible far below you. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Naturally, this means that the levels are not really set on terra firma (um, though one level contains a pipe that drops you back down to the ground level for a bit). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So falling to your death is a common theme in the sky levels. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And before too long we get a new kind of block (one that drops you if you stand on it for more than a second) as well as frozen coins your fireballs will thaw out. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 With all the secret stuff found in the game, "Super Mario... 3" is very generous with coins, 1-Ups, and power-ups. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, look at all the coins this switch gives ya. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you then hurry up and beat the timer, you can get down that pipe and get a Hammer Bros. Suit (which are completely awesome). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can now throw hammers and kill enemies that fireballs can't (like the Boo Diddlies). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And the level design doesn't repeat itself. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like this moving floor - this is the [only] time in the game this happens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They don't re-use every good idea over and over again. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Instead, they keep coming up with fresh new ideas! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (What a crazy concept!) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One funny thing, if ya finish up a level with one of the special suits on, the King's dialogue will be a bit different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's all sorts of little details like that. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's part [of] what makes the game so great. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Super Mario Bros. 3" is a harder game than the first one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily, the game gives you tons of extra lives. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's also much longer - almost 90 levels, by my count. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the levels are shorter than those of the first 'Mario'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But take this into consideration. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... An all-level speedrun for "Super Mario..." is about 20 minutes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For "...Mario... 2" about 26 minutes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For "...Mario... 3" an hour and 24 minutes. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, aside from being incredibly long, there's no sorta Save feature. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, normally if you were actually playing the game without any kind of Save States, you would use the Warp Whistles to make it possible to finish in a reasonable amount of time. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once you found the whistles, you can just go ahead and warp straight to Level 8 (though, of course, the Warp Whistles are reasonably well-hidden). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Another very helpful item is the Cloud, which allows you to simply skip one level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you're having a really tough time on a level, just use the cloud and go past it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's also a 2-Player mode. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like the first game, players alternate, but they both use the same overWorld Map. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So Player 1 can, for example, play Level 1, then Player 2 can play Level 2. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So they take turns working towards the end of the game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 When both players stand on the same square, this will start a competitive version of the original "Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you can actually steal the other player's cards. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, later levels do get quite a bit harder, like this weird fortress with no enemies that ends in a dead end. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Turns out there's a hidden switch that turns everything into coins. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, man! Look at all those coins! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This will reveal an otherwise hidden door. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Or this level, where ya need to reach the very top of the room, using this series of moving platforms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this sorta thing just shows the enormous leap in creativity, when it came to level design. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's really absolutely nothing like this in the original "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 On this level, ya have to have the Star power activated for [pretty] much the entire thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And need to move very quickly in order to reach the next Star in time. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This level is, sort of, a maze made out of pipes. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Exploration will lead you to tons of coins, extra lives, and so on. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of this stuff is hard to find, but remember that the game was designed to be played out over and over again and retain its entertainment value for weeks and weeks and weeks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, it's not a game you'd be able to get through the first time ya played it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You'd have to discover things, find the Warp Whistles, ...that sort of stuff. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It would take ya a while!. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, by the time you reach the last level, you should have quite a few extra lives. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I [only] have 66, but it's really not that hard to get the full 99. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you get the Star and the end of each level, that means five lives every three levels. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 World 8 has a few of these forced-scrolling levels, where ya make your way past, uh, Bowser's Army, Navy, and Air Force. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, man! Just look at the giant cannons on these things! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game is visually [pretty] impressive! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And it does start getting [pretty] hard, near the end. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's when some of these items come in handy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I would highly recommend using the P-Wing to help ya fly over this level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's just too many chances to fall to your death. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Finally, you'll reach Bowser's castle and then the game throws lasers at you. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Bowser has laser technology? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Really? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The final castle is not too bad; it's not nearly as maze-like as some of the earlier fortresses. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a few tricky jumps, here and there. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And Bowser, himself, is a little anti-climactic. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though, I suppose the first time you encounter him, you might try jumping on him (like all the other bosses in the game). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But, still, look at how well animated he is, compared to the first game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Really, "...Mario... 3" is one of those Rare games where everything comes together: the art, the music, the level design. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's fun, no two levels are really alike, it's extremely replayable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can always find new hidden stuff, the more you play it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Player experimentation is rewarded. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game gives you much more choice as to how you want to play the game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are multiple paths on the overworld (so you don't even have to play every single level). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The fact that the development time was so long gave Miyamoto and company the chance to make everything as close to perfect as possible. 🍇 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And it's certainly vastly superior to every other side-scrolling Platformer we've seen so far. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I mean, it's been many years, since I've played this game and it still holds up as well today as any other game of this era. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Is this the best N.E.S. game ever? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, that's a matter of personal opinion, but it was certainly the most anticipated, fondly remembered, and well-received game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. 🍇🍌
