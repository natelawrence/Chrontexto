👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chronturbo Episode 5 ✨


✅🏝️🍊🍓 Alright folks, it's Dr. Sparkle again. 🍇

✅🏝️🍊🍓 Geez! It seems like forever since the last episode. 🍇

✅🏝️🍊🍓 Well anyway, sorry it's so late, but here we are again. 🍇🍌


✅🏝️🍊🍓 The P.C. Engine schedule continues to get a bit more hectic as we get closer to the <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989> holiday season. 🍇

✅🏝️🍊🍓 Today we're gonna finish up July and blast through all of August and September. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 [We're] gonna see a number of Arcade ports today, as well as some obscure (and rather shitty) original titles. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hyper Dyne Side Arms 🇯🇵 // Side Arms Hyper Dyne 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 July 14 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Capcom 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: NEC Avenue 🇯🇵 // Radiance Software 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We ended last episode with a classic Shooter, "Blazing Lazers", and we begin this episode with a not-so-classic Shooter, "Side Arms" (or "Side Arms: Hyper Dyne", as it's officially called in Japan). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the second port of a Capcom Arcade game for the system (the first being "Son Son <Two::II>") and, once again, this is published by N.E.C., not Capcom themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, in the U.S. this was one of the very few <Turbo-Graphics::TurboGrafx> games not published by N.E.C. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Rather, it was by a small company called Radiance Software, which seemed to have very close ties to Capcom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were also well-known for their involvement in the canceled, ah, Nintendo Entertainment System 'California Raisins' game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The guy who ran Radiance, Christopher Riggs, actually lists himself as being a Product Developer at Capcom in the early <Nineteen-Nineties::1990s>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Prior to Radiance, he apparently co-founded a company called Pacific DataWorks with, uh, Troy Lyndon (who was an interesting guy who much later, uh, was behind the, uh -- the infamous "Left Behind" computer video game). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Pacific DataWorks mostly did DOS and Commodore <Sixty-Four::64> ports for Capcom, including "Side Arms"! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Riggs also had a company called Riggs Interactive which did, uh, Computer ports for Capcom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, it's no surprise that the first Radiance game is, of course, a Capcom port. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyhoo, Earth got blown up or something, and your little robot mecha dude is out there, uh, to kill lots of aliens. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Mechanics are more or less like similar Shooters of the era (such as "Gradius"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Enemies drop power-ups, speed-ups, and other types of, uh, special weapons. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Nothing too new or exciting, here, but there are a couple interesting ideas. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The main one is you can turn around and fire in the opposite direction by hitting the second button (making "Side Arms" kind of a predecessor to "Forgotten Worlds"). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, "Side Arms" was originally an Arcade game from <Nineteen-Eighty-Six::1986>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from the ability to fire, uh, front and back, a big feature of "Side Arms" was that two players could occasionally combine into a single more powerful form (with one player controlling the mech and the other controlling his special attack weapons). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The home version dropped this <Two::2>-Player mode, meaning that your combined form is basically just a temporary upgrade. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It lasts until you get hit. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The other cool feature is the ability to select your -- which weapon you wanna use from the Start Menu (as opposed to losing your current weapon when you pick up a new one, like in most other Shooters). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can actually carry a whole bunch of weapons at once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is actually very helpful, since certain types of weapons are more useful than others in some spots. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, certain weapons are [pretty] much vital for some areas. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And this leads me to one issue that so many Shoot-'em-Ups have. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If you die once, you are [pretty] much screwed. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Side Arms" is even worse than many other similar games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When the action gets hectic and you screw up and get killed, you'll be brought back to life with, like, a single random underpowered weapon, generally with enemies, like, closing in on you from all sides. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, get killed and odds are good that you'll get killed again within a second or two. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And there are so many damn enemies (like missiles, et cetera) that home in on you and follow you around, as you try to avoid them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And when you have, like, a very basic weapon that [only] shoots in one direction, it's [pretty] difficult to pick these guys off. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Also, like "Gradius", picking up too many speed power-ups will make you move, uh, too fast and be hard to control precisely. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Overall, it's actually a [pretty] hard game (harder than, uh, "Gradius" or "R-Type", in my opinion) but it actually, uh, looks great and I liked it better than the Genesis port of "Forgotten Worlds". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Takeda Shingen 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 July 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Jaleco | AiCOM 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: AiCOM 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We exit July with a real stinker. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 From AiCOM, it's "Takeda Shingen". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 'Aha!', you say, 'We've already seen this game in 'Chrontendo'. It was, like, a Strategy Game, published by HOT-B.'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, no, this is actually a completely different and unrelated game called "Takeda Shingen". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, Takeda Shingen (the real person) was a <Sixteenth::16th> century warlord, known for (among other things) having a badass set of armor (which is, uh, sort of semi-accurately depicted here). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Rather than being a Strategy Game, this is a rather dull Beat-'em-Up and it's a painfully slow affair. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You have exactly two moves (at least, at first). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's attack with a sword slash and jump. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You'll be, uh, taking enemies head-on, uh, just sort of hacking at them until they die. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They block a lot, so normally you'll just, sort of, walk up to them and start repeatedly slashing at them. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They'll block a few times and then you'll get a hit in. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was a port of a Jaleco Arcade game (which looks a lot nicer). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The game isn't exactly hot shit, but your character moves much faster and there's a bit of action. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is hardly top-tier stuff, as of <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988>, but it seems reasonably bearable. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's even, like, bonus rounds where you can get on a horse and do some target practice. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The horse stuff got completely stripped out from the P.C. Engine version. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the result is just so damn monotonous. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You know, I got a good way through this game and there were a [pretty] limited number of enemy types. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's basically dudes with swords (who are just like you), dudes with a long flail on a chain (and these guys are annoying), and dudes with a long spear. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Boss battles are at the end of each level. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though each level looks about the same, so there's really not much to distinguish one level from the other. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Bosses are really nothing exciting. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy is just a big version of the swordsman. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Post-boss fight, you visit a shop where ya can refill your health and buy some critical of... -- offense and, uh, defensive upgrades, such as the war fan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, in real life, uh, Takeda is often depicted with his war fan. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a famous story about how he deflected an enemy blade with his fan, once. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So this game, naturally, has him, you know, carrying it around. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Takeda Shingen" isn't really a fun game to play, especially in comparison to contemporary Beat-'em-Ups like "Golden Axe" or "Final Fight". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later, you get some better attacks, but the lack of variety really kills any excitement. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It just feels like you're fighting the same fight over and over and over again. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Your Health Bar is [pretty] long and Health Refills are [pretty] frequent. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, there's not much challenge at all for the entire first half of the game (until you get to this boss, who's, like, ten times harder than the last one). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, overall, "Takeda Shingen" is a bummer of a game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Maison Ikkoku 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 August 4 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Micro Cabin 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Micro Cabin 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, we enter August with "Maison Ikkoku" and a new publisher, Micro Cabin. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've heard their name come up a few times before in 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They were actually a [pretty] prominent publisher of, uh, games for Japanese computers, back in the <Eighties::'80s>. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like a lot of other sort of dodgy P.C. Engine games, this one has some [pretty] decent music. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Right, so, "Maison Ikkoku" is one of these inescapable menu-based Adventure Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Luckily for us, we have an English translation by Dave Shadroff and Matt LaFrance. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You play as one Yusaku Godai: a down on his luck student, living in sort of a rundown boarding house. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The manager of the boarding house turns out to be (of course) a beautiful young woman who was recently widowed, named Kyoko. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This was based on a popular manga, by the famous manga artist, Rumiko Takahashi, who you might know from such comics as 'Urusei Yatsura' and 'Ranma ½'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It basically chronicles, uh, Godai's desire to express his love for Kyoko, as well as the comings and goings of the wacky residents of the boarding house. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Eventually, of course, at the end of the series, the protagonists get married. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This first appeared on the M.S.X., back in <Nineteen-Eighty-Seven::1987>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It looks [pretty] similar to this port, actually! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It also wound up on the F.M. <Seven::7> and a few other computers. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the first console appearance of this game was on the FamiCom, which we saw very briefly in "...Episode <Thirty-Three::33>". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At the time, I [pretty] much said, "Well, we'll check this out in more detail when we reach it in 'Chronturbo'.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And now, my dear friends, that day has arrived. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It turns out to be a reasonably normal Adventure Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... This character, here, is some kind of weird pervert dude who builds tunnels and peepholes in the walls between the rooms. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... You find a porno mag, which contains <quote-unquote [pretty] radical stuff::"[pretty] radical stuff">. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Later, you can actually g... uh -- give it back to him... sort of, uh, win his favor. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Much [of] the game takes place inside the titular 'Maison Ikkoku'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... 'Maison' is simply the French word for 'house', which (I think) is being used ironically (in the sense [of] calling this place 'Maison', you know, sort of, tried to, like, give it a touch of class). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... 'Ikkoku', I believe, means hotheaded or temperamental (perhaps referring to the various nutty residents, here). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In this game, you actually save by going to the bathroom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's naturally all sorts of goofy sexual innuendo going on between the characters. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this, so far, seems to be the first P.C. Engine game that actually shows nipples in one of its human characters in an obviously sexualized way (as opposed to nipples on a statue or a monster or something). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... For the most part, you go around talking to people, collecting items, and using them in sort of unintuitive ways. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's your love interest, though you, uh, actually call her by the rather formal name, um, Kanrinin-san, rather than her real name. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can't interact with her too much yet. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... You actually have to get on her good side first. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 A lot of the game involves, uh, talking [to] people and getting on their good side by giving them things. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Among the other things, uh, you find, uh, her bra is up on the roof and you have a daydream about her, um, once, uh, you found the ladder that allows you to climb up on the roof. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from the house, you can travel to a couple locations nearby, such as this store. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The cashier is meant to look like Lum from 'Urusei Yatsura'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Ya buy things here to bribe the residents with. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Um... A great deal of time is spent, you know, sorta dealing with these annoying housemates. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Just like in the comic, Godai tends to fantasize about putting the mack on his landlord, but he's too scared to do anything. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The main goal of the game revolves actually around trying to look at that picture you see on the left-hand side of the screen, believe it or not. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, you know, like a lot of these sorts of things, your goal is kind of vague and you make progress in seemingly random ways. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But the art is good, the music is decent, so it's still a lot better than some of the awful, uh -- the other awful Adventure Games we've seen. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Power League II 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 August 8 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hudson was, of course, the co-creator of the P.C. Engine and they published all the console's games in Japan for about the first year. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, by this point, they are outnumbered by third-party publishers (at least in Japan). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the first of three Hudson-published games today, "Power League <Two::II>", a Baseball Game, of course, and the sequel to the first "Power League" game, which was released about <fourteen::14> months before this one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There are a plethora of modes here - typical stuff: Single Game mode, a Pennant Mode, All-Star (nothing we haven't seen before). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, the first "Power League" game got a U.S. release, under the name "World Class Baseball". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Power League <Two::II>" was never released outside of Japan, though. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, there are six 'Power League' games on the P.C. Engine and the first one was the [only] one to get a non-Japanese release. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Naturally, this looks and feels a lot like the first "Power League" game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 If we compare the two, back to back, we see the sprites have been changed a bit. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But both games look very similar (with one exception). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In the first game, after the batter got a hit, it showed the outfield straight down, with the, uh, camera's line of sight being perpendicular to the ground, much like the, uh, Sega Genesis', uh, Sports Games, like "Tommy Lasorda Baseball". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Power League <Two::II>" uses a much more traditional <forty-five-degree::45°> angle (looking sort of down and out over the field). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As always, playing against the C.P.U. is tricky. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's certainly a way to strike out the C.P.U., but I didn't find it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Generally the C.P.U. would get a good powerful hit against anything I would throw at it. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When I was at the bat, I'd get lots of fly balls (and, uh, the computer would actually catch these with absolute <one-hundred percent::100%> accuracy) as well as tons of foul balls. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Like, maybe four out of five hits would be a foul ...or just really weak hits. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, ya have to play these things for a little while to sorta get, you know, the feel to them and I didn't play it long enough to actually, you know, get very good at this thing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, "Power League <Two::II>" is (just like its predecessor) a sharp-looking Baseball Game that doesn't really stand out in any way, other than its, you know, nice-looking graphics. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And we will get to see four more of these during the life of the console. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Break In 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 August 10 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: [?] 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Naxat Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Our third P.C. Engine game {is} from Naxat (a.k.a. Taxan) who had previously released the, uh, great Pinball Game, "Alien Crush", as well as a Golf Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, we have a Pool Game from them, "Break In", featuring Simulation, Action, Technique. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Geez! Is this an instructional sex game? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Simulation is sort of a tournament mode, Action is just like one-off, uh, playing a game, and Technique is like a tutorial practice mode deal. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Break In" is [pretty] generous with the types of games you can play. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, you have, uh, Yotsudama (a four-ball game that's played on a table with no pockets and doesn't really resemble normal pool that much) and "Bowliards", which appears to be a, uh, (m... -- actually is misspelled here) -- is sort of a hybrid between bowling and billiards. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hmm! Yes, I would like some nice shiny oranges and a glass of... orange soda? ...or maybe a big glass of Gras Manier? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Man! We're gonna get fucked up on that Gras Manier, there. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Lots of options, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Choose singles versus doubles. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Who is controlled by computer and who is controlled by... 'Man'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Sorry, ladies! This is a man's game.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Pick a character (choose from either seven men characters or 'Woman'). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'Dragon'!? Come on! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This guy's hobby is Golf? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I'm surprised it's not... you know... Billiards. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Actually, I'm kidding; there are seven, uh, female characters as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hmm! I like Emmy's dumb <Eighties::'80s> fashion and, uh, Sophia's, sort of, adorable geek chic but really, uh, Sigrid (the boozy actress) seems like the coolest to me. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, picking a card determines who breaks. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, when you actually get ready to shoot a ba... -- shoot the ball, here, you have a great deal of control, much like the typical Golf Games of this era. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And you have this image ball concept (not something I've seen in Pool Games prior to this). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 C.P.U. players are generally decent but not <one-hundred percent::100%> perfect, which is a nice switch from the various Baseball Games we've seen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Franky's [pretty] cool, but I think that mustache is fake. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Like a lot of other P.C. Engine games, "Break In" has some [pretty] chill music. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, this is the Technique part. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (I'm trying to learn trick shots.) 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Good luck. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 We've [only] seen a few Pool Games throughout the 'Chron...' series. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I still kinda like Compile's nutty "Lunar Pool" game the best (which was on the N.E.S.). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But among, sort of, like, regular serious Pool Games, "Break In" is definitely one of the slickest. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 F-1 Dream 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 August 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Capcom 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: NEC Avenue 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Whoa-ho! Did I load up a FamiCom game by mistake? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 What is this? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, it's yet another Capcom Arcade port. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And we're not really getting top-tier Capcom stuff, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Mega Drive gets "Ghouls 'n Ghosts" and the P.C. Engine gets "F-<One::1> Dream". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's a bit of a story, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "F-<One::1> (uh) Dream" is one of those career-type Racing Games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Alright, so let's fire up some F-<One::1> Racing action. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Wait. What's going on, here? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 These are not F-<One::1> cars. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is apparently kind of a prologue to the main F-<One::1> Racing Game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your car is super lame (and I'm sure there's no way to win). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Anyway, the original "F-<One::1> Dream" was a <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988> Arcade game, which used the likenesses of real Formula One drivers in the intro. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a [pretty] basic top-down Racer. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I guess there was still, [like], some sort of demand for this kinda thing in the late <Eighties::'80s>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (I don't know why.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One funny touch was, if ya smacked into the guardrails near spectators, they all go running hysterically. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Right, so I'll fill ya in on the basics of "F-<One::1> Dream". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is one of those Racing Games where ya collect money for racing and then use it to buy upgrades for your car (which starts out super shitty). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 First, you actually need to hire guys to work on your car. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Here, I'm, uh, hiring a tire guy and an engine guy. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 After paying these dudes, I have enough money left to put some better tires on my car. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then it's off to the F-<One::1> race! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 (Well, this is technically the tr... uh -- time trial but the actual race is up next.) 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, you just sorta cruise around the track and, uh -- in order to qualify for the race. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However there's a couple [of] things about this type of game that drive me crazy (namely the controls). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I've seen this in, uh, other Japanese top-down Racing Games on the FamiCom but it drives me nuts here as well. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The controls are not from the perspective of the driver, but from the viewpoint of the game's camera. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Meaning that if you're pointed up and wanna turn right, you press Right on the Directional-Pad (which makes sense, so far). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But if you're headed facing down (towards the bottom of the screen) and you wanna turn the vehicle right, you press Left, because the vehicle's right is towards the left-hand side of the screen. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This tends to confuse me, since we usually think of, you know, driving from the driver's point of view. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Especially when I'm heading towards the bottom of the screen and drift towards the side of the road, trying to correct myself will usually result in me driving off the road, since it feels to me like the controls are reversed. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 You start bringing in money [pretty] quickly (even for doing poorly) and you will slowly be able to improve your vehicle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Among other things, if the car gets damaged too much, it will explode in a rather cool fashion and you'll get a Game Over. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Beyond that, there's really not that much to say about "F-<One::1> Dream". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We've already seen a lotta games like this already. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We saw a much more creative take on a career Racing Game last time, with Namco's "Final Lap Twin". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Quite frankly, the most distinguishing thing about "F-<One::1> Dream" is just how appallingly last-generation the graphics look. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Rock-On 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 August 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Manjyudo 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Big Club 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, after taking in that weird-looking box cover, you really should pause this and take a moment to read this batshit insane intro, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's about, uh, finding mysterious fortunes and "Busters" (uh, "the name..." for "...people we call... fortune hunters"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Their "historic journey" is to get "FISA" ("called legend by the people"). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Hmm. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The "one person..." who "...can make it real ... has got to be billionet and radical, physically and mentally". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And "Yes, you are the one!" 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One of the great things about doing a series like this is you find shit that doesn't seem like it has any reason to exist (for example, "Rock-On"). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This is the second game from publisher Big Club and developer Manjyudo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They had released a game in June called "Jinmu Denshō Yaksa" (covered in "Chronturbo ... <Four::4>") which took [a] character from a P.C.-<Eighty-Eight::88> game and stuffed him into a "Space Harrier" clone. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As far as I can tell, "Rock-On" is a completely original game. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a Shoot-'em-Up (and not a great one at that). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, uh, V.G. Den (a review site for the P.C. Engine and Super FamiCom games) calls it the worst Shoot-'em-Up for the console. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know if that's true, but damn, it sure ain't good. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If nothing else, ya get a lot of power-ups! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, this looks [pretty] boring. Huh? 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, I guess there's a couple things we can say about this. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 First of all, the power-up system is a little different. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can carry three different special weapons at once, though none of them display even the slightest amount of creativity. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There's the three-way shot, the laser (ya know, the one where ya shoot both directions vertically, one where ya shoot both directions horizontally). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Use the Start button to move between them but there's no Pause feature in the game, meaning ya have to switch weapons on the fly (unlike in "Side Arms") which is, you know, kind of a pain. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Rock-On" uses, kind of, like, a cute pudgy design style. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Your ship looks a little bit like Opa-Opa. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 One annoying factor here are these warps. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They actually send you back to the beginning of the level if you -- if you don't know what they are and accidentally go into one. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I don't know much about the developer, Manjyodo, except they made a handful of P.C. Engine games and were mostly involved in importing [and] distributing Arcade games. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 As of <Nineteen-Ninety-Eight::1998> their website was still up, but all it had was listings of arcade cabinets for sale, along with commercial boats (like, big boats). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, they were selling an <eleven-million-dollar::$11 million> cargo boat. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 There's really nothing interesting or exciting or creative, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 In fact, uh, this boss is ripped right out of "R-Type". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The nerve! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Instead of points, ya get money, though I never did see a shop or anything to spend the money in. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I love the way the interface [at] the bottom actually gets covered up by background objects. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 I haven't seen this happen in other games on the console, so I assume it's a problem with the game, itself, not the emulation. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, we're definitely scraping the bottom of the barrel, here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a real puzzler, this one is. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And I still have no idea why it's called 'Rock-On'. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ TurboGrafx-16 released in The United States ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Oh, hey! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 One important thing happened in August <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The <Turbo-Graphics-Sixteen::TurboGrafx-16> was released in the United States (purportedly debuting on August <Twenty-Ninth::29th>). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Though as was often the case, it was apparently a limited launch (just in New York and California). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, while Hudson was the most prolific publisher for the system in Japan, almost all the games here in the U.S. were released by N.E.C. themselves. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 With N.E.C.'s U.S. headquarters apparently being the (I'm sure very lovely) town of Wood Dale, Illinois. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The console itself was redesigned quite a bit and turned out quite a bit larger than the P.C. Engine. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Uh... It had a [pretty] decent selection of launch titles, actually. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Aside from, of course, "Keith Courage in Alpha Zones" which was the pack-in game, there was "R-Type", "Legendary Axe", uh, "Alien Crush", and "Dungeon Explorer". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Along with the ubiquitous Golf and Racing Games, "Power Golf" and "Victory Run", rounding it out was two Beat-'em-Ups, "Vigilante" and "China Warrior" (a.k.a. "The Kung Fu"), which was the first game released for the system in Japan. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, eight games, which was actually a [pretty] hardy, uh, launch lineup for back then. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Some sources say "Blazing Lazers" was a launch title. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, upon further inspection, this appears to be false. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Here's an ad from 'GamePro' in late <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989> (not as cool-looking as the Genesis ads). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The TurboBooster, by the way, was an add-on that allowed for a composite video output and stereo sound, instead of the standard R.F. connection. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The TurboC.D. is featured in the ad, even though that would actually not come out until later in <Nineteen-Ninety::1990>. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 As ya recall, the <Turbo-Graphics::TurboGrafx> came out, um, in the U.S. about, uh, two weeks after the Genesis. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, this was sort of like the first battle in the <sixteen::16>-bit wars, with the still somewhat mysterious Super FamiCom lurking somewhere in the wings in -- in the -- the future. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 'E.G.M.' did quite a bit of coverage on the new P.C. Engine, along with lots of Sega coverage as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 The Genesis was ten dollars cheaper than the <Turbo-Graphics::TurboGrafx> (a hundred [and] ninety instead of two hundred) and, uh, both were noticeably cheaper than either the N.E.S. or the Master System with inflation factored in. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 While Sega obviously overtook N.E.C. eventually, in late <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989> the <sixteen::16>-bit playing field appeared to be, uh, completely up for grabs. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair 🇯🇵 // Monster Lair 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 August 31 🇯🇵 // 1989 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Westone | Alfa 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Alright, our first game of August <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989> is the first C.D. game this episode: "Wonder Boy <Three::III>: Monster Lair" (or just plain "Monster Lair", as it was called in the U.S.), released by Hudson in Japan, naturally, and N.E.C. in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's nothing fancy, C.D.-wise, on this game (no anime intros or anything). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Instead, the C.D. is used just to supply some really radical music. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Monster Lair"'s design harkens back to the first two 'Wonder Boy' games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We have similar enemies, the island theme here has been seen before, you still need to collect fruit to stay alive, you can trip on rocks and lose health that way. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Like "Wonder Boy in Monster Land" it, sort of, ditches the 'jungle dude' get-up from "Wonder Boy" and instead gives him, like, armor and a shield. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The big twist? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Monster Lair" is basically a Shoot-'em-Up. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Your sword somehow fires projectiles, the screen scrolls automatically (as if you were in a Horizontal Shooter), and you find various special weapons that replace your peashooter. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's laid out like a Platformer in most spots, and then you'll actually find some sort of very basic Platforming jumping going on, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Darn! This is some sick music! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, after one level where you walk on the ground, you enter a giant skull, and then you are, uh, you get an airborne section with a boss battle at the end. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And these parts are like very simplistic Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's [only] one type of enemy and they come at you in relatively simple patterns. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The first boss is a big fish. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I love the way his scales are actually smaller fish that he shoots at you. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The enemies and boss always had some kind of connection to level that preceded it. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, there was a lot of water during the Platformer part of the episode and the enemies here are fish. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Wonder Boy <Three::III>..." has a Life Bar, but that seems a little deceptive. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, yeah sure, you die when it gets empty, but a lot of the perils in this game will kill you outright, even if you have quite a few bars left. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Certain things, uh, like you know falling off a cliff, make sense or being crushed by giant rocks. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Touching the boss will kill you, of course. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But also these not-particularly-dangerous-looking mole things will kill you in one hit. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Yet, touching some enemies [only] knocked on your Life Bar a notch. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's actually kind of odd. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, "Wonder Boy <Three::III>: Monster Lair" was originally an Arcade game from <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I've [delved] into the horrifyingly confusing history of the 'Wonder Boy' series before. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But, as a reminder, the original "Wonder Boy <Three::III>..." was developed by Westone, Sega released it as an Arcade game, and then Hudson ported to the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This should not be confused with the other "Wonder Boy <Three::III>: The Dragon's Trap" - the Master System game, which we actually covered not that long ago in 'Chronsega'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And which also got a P.C. Engine port in Japan, under the name (God help me) "Adventure Island", which was the name Hudson used for "Wonder Boy (<One::I>)" on the Nintendo Entertainment System in the U.S.. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The bottom line is that "Wonder Boy <Three::III>: Monster Lair" is, as far as I can remember, the [only] 'Wonder Boy' game Hudson released where they chose to use the name 'Wonder Boy'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's also one of the most perfect-looking Arcade ports we've seen, so far. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Many of these sprites look exactly the same in the Arcade and the -- the home -- P.C. Engine version. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The [only] thing that was lost was the multiple background layers, which the P.C. Engine didn't support, and it also removed the <Two::2>-Player option. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But, visually, the game looks perfect. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's hard to dislike "Monster Lair", simply because it's so nice-looking. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's a reasonably fun game, and has an amazing soundtrack, but it is [pretty] repetitive. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Every level has, like, the exact same half-Platformer/half-Shooter pattern - and neither style is particularly well developed. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's also [pretty] long (about <thirteen::13> levels, I think), so good luck having the perseverance to finish it. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 That's probably a bit too long for a game that really never deviates from the pattern set in the first level. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Should you finish the game, you'll learn that you were trying to defeat an alien invasion and retrieve your stolen armor from the aliens, which is something that you would never ever guess until you actually reached the end. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, we'll see this game again in 'Chronsega' for the Genesis. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 That game adds back in the multi-level scrolling, but sadly redraws all the sprites to look less cute. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Oh well. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Narazumono Sentō Butai Bloody Wolf 🇯🇵 // Bloody Wolf 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 September 1 🇯🇵 // 1990 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Data East 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: DECO 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Moving on to September, we have a game from Data East: "Narazumono Sentō Butai Bloody Wolf" (which means something like 'Rogue Combat Squadron: Bloody Wolf'). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In the U.S. it was released in <Nineteen-Ninety::1990>, under the shortened named "Bloody Wolf", which is actually what we call the original Arcade game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Ya start with selecting a player ({it} doesn't matter which one, really) and then enter in your code name. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, you might think that "Bloody Wolf" looks like a game designed for two players, based on the character select screen. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But, in fact, there is no <Two::2>-Player option in the home version. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The original Arcade game was, naturally, for two players. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Once again, the President's been kidnapped. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 {It's} interesting how this never happens in real life, but happens all the time in video games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Naturally, for a mission of this importance, they send in one guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Bloody Wolf" is very much in the style of "MERCS" or (to give an example of game we just recently saw) "Rambo <Three::III>" for the Genesis. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Hiding behind explosive barrels is a terrible idea, you guys. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There are various rooms you can enter, often containing some enemies, as well as hostages to rescue, and perhaps a power-up. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I just got the shotgun, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Hostages will also sometimes give you helpful items, like this key. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Bosses will appear at the end of each part. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Uh... Here's the first one: Shotgun Man. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Bloody Wolf" has some rather gibberish-y dialogue. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This annoying dude brings out his bulletproof buddies to form a barrier between you and him. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Well, I guess it's a semi-permeable barrier, since he can shoot through them, but you can't. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Rather than, uh, handing out tanks, "Bloody Wolf" lets you jump on motorcycles, which go really fast and can just tear through dudes. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The game's bosses show quite a bit of variety, unlike, say, "Wonder Boy <Three::III>...". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is, sort of, a Vertical Shoot-'em-Up style boss battle here, made more -- made more challenging by the fact that submarine blows up parts of the platform you're standing on. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The Arcade "Bloody Wolf" came out in <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988> and was [pretty] typical of these "Commando"/"MERCS"-type games of the time. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It feels a bit more of a quarter-muncher than the Console version. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It sort of feels a bit more frantic, whereas the P.C. Engine game feels kinda like a controlled experience. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Various minor changes have been made throughout the game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 One entirely new level was added on for the P.C. Engine port. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 For example, here's one of the changes: This boss doesn't have any bulletproof guys who run in front of him. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You just basically shoot him like you would a regular boss. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I suppose the, uh, P.C. Engine "Bloody Wolf" feels a bit more 'refined', somehow. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Bloody Wolf" is divided into several large scenes, which are a bit bigger than a normal video game level and contain multiple areas. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We get a bit of cutscenes and plot advancement between the levels. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Some of these bosses are colorful enough they could almost be, like, uh, straight out of "Metal Gear", like this flamethrower dude. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I think what makes "Bloody Wolf", uh, so playable is it doesn't really repeat itself and never spends too much of the time on using the same gimmick. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It keeps introducing new stuff. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Compare this to something like the Genesis "Rambo <Three::III>" game, where you're sorta spending all your time just, like, running around in these huge mage -- maze levels, shooting down the same enemies over and over again. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Bloody Wolf"'s shorter Action set pieces are obviously products of its Arcade roots. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But just like "Contra" on the N.E.S., "Bloody Wolf" feels like an acceptable Console game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's reasonably long, doesn't rely on tons of unfair deaths. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There are some things I didn't like about it. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But, for the most part, what I played was really great. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As we finally get to the location where the President is being held, we get this huge palace-like level. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You're then stripped of all your guns and grenades and are forced to fight a boss, using your knife [only]. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And then, of course, you rescue the President, which leads to almost, kind of, like, a little mini Escort Mission, though the President can't get shot. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And yes, you actually have to get out of here, with the President in tow, armed [only] with a knife. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Once you, uh, get to the pick-up point, then a big plot twist happens. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, you need to take the other character (you know, the one you didn't select at the beginning of the game) and rescue the first guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You know, I was actually liking the game, up to this point. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But some games will have, like, a roadblock or something that you simply can't get past (or you just don't have the patience to get past) and I actually ran into the roadblock, here. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There were a couple of special enemies you need to fight to get past this level (sort of like mini-bosses) and one of them involves another knife fight. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And this knife dude is *way* harder than the previous boss fight. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Just getting near the guy will cause you to take damage. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 He's way faster than you, and I could not figure out how to beat this dude. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Still, you know, you're probably smarter than me and you'll have no problem with this. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, by all means, give "Bloody Wolf" a try. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ordyne 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 September 8 🇯🇵 // 1990 February [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Namco 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Namco 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Wow, three games in a row that got U.S. releases. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is "Ordyne", published by Namco (or rather 'Namcot', in Japan). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Namco had been, uh, the most prolific third-party publisher for the P.C. Engine, so far. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is, uh, the ninth Namco game for the console, I think. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Namco is also the first third-party publisher to get involved with the P.C. Engine. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In fact, Namco and Hudson were the [only] two companies putting out P.C. Engine games for about the first year. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Right off the bat, that is one sneaky way to die, here. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Uh... Usually you don't expect to, like -- an enormous ship to just appear out of nowhere behind you in, like, the first <Twenty::20> seconds of the game, but, you know... 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Clearly, "Ordyne" is a Horizontal Shoot-'em-Up, like "Rock-On". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Um... You know, it's in the Cute mode, but this is quite a bit better than "Rock-On". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The object is to rescue your, you know, kidnapped girlfriend, of course (as per the intro sequence). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Certain enemies will fly in waves and drop items that, you know, sort of, "Gradius"-like if you shoot 'em all. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 However, they don't drop power-ups, but crystals, instead. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Crystals are spent in these, uh, little shops that appear midway through the level. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, it's kinda like, you know, "Fantasy Zone" and, you know, so many other Shoot-'em-Ups that have shops that we've seen. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Uh... Note, uh, Pac-Man's appearance in, there. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Actually, all the power-up icons are actually [pretty] insane-looking. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The 'Vulcan' is just a super-fast shot. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, um, in a cool twist, you have a brief encounter, mid-air, with the ship that you're chasing. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Uh... This ship will actually be the first boss, but -- so you're, sort of, served, like, a little preview, here, of that. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As I mentioned, this was released in the U.S. as well (published by N.E.C., of course). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, "Ordyne" was an Arcade game, and it's kind of a strange game to port to this console. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I'll discuss why in just a minute. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The thing about the special weapons in "Ordyne" is they are all very temporary and disappear when the timer runs out. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You see that little bar, um, under the weapon on the left-hand side there? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Your weapons disappear quite quickly, and you -- if you get shot while you have a special weapon, it will disappear, but you won't die. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, the special weapon also acts as, like, a one-hit shield (you know, while it lasts). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The 'After' is a powerful weapon that will be extremely helpful in taking out the first boss. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This guy will go down in a couple hits with the 'After' weapon. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Otherwise, it'll take a really long time to kill this guy with your regular peashooter. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Ordyne" is a bit more manageable in the length department, um, than "Monster Lair" is, with [only] seven levels, compared to about (I think) <thirteen::13> or so in "Monster Lair". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Earlier, I'd mentioned that "Ordyne" was kind of an odd choice for a port. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, this is the [only] console this was ported to... an... um -- though it -- of course, it eventually turned up on the Virtual Console. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The Arcade "Ordyne" was one of the first Namco games to use their new Namco System <Two::2> board, which was, uh, a [pretty] high-end board, at that time. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It had -- It ha... -- had all kinds of sprite zooming and rotating capabilities. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Not to be confused with the, uh, Super Nintendo's Mode <Seven::7>, which involved *background* rotation and scaling. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, "Ordyne"'s main appeal, you know, as an Arcade game, was all the cool sprite effects that were being used. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's tons of parallax scrolling, huge sprites, ... 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Check out how awesome this boss fight is! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The whole ship rotates and sinks when you destroy it. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's even a whole section built around sprite rotation. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's also a naked butterfly lady in there! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, the entire game is basically a showcase for Namco's new arcade board, which makes it odd that it was ported to a console that simply *cannot* replicate these fancy effects. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Here, it uses round obstructions, which move in a way to sorta give the illusion the whole thing is rotating. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 A decent enough solution, but, you know, it isn't quite the same thing that we saw in the Arcade game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Still, "Ordyne" looks [pretty] nice. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You know, it's a decent little Shooter with a good deal of variety in it. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The main thing is: I don't like those damn temporary weapons! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They're [pretty] expensive, and they disappear really fast! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But, you know, if that were not the case, I guess you wouldn't have much incentive to collect crystals. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Anyway, it's definitely a lot better than "Rock-On". 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Albatross 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 September 14 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Laser Soft 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Telenet Japan 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Right away, we've got another C.D.-ROM game, "Super Albatross", from Telenet (who earlier brought us "Valis <Two::II>"). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 {It's} got some [pretty] great music, there! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Ya actually see the Laser Soft logo everywhere on this game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Laser Soft being a subsidiary of Telenet that did a lot of C.D.-ROM games (hence the name '*Laser* Soft'). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They're generally listed as the developer, and Telenet is listed as the publisher on this. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Uh... Same with "Valis <Two::II>", actually. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In fact, "Super Albatross", despite being a Golf Game, almost seems kind of like a parody of "Valis <Two::II>". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We'll take a closer look at this a bit later. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But here's the game menu. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's, like, a main story mode, as well as a regular Golf Game for up to four players. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The P.C. Engine [only] comes with one controller, so the players need to pass around the controller when it's the next guy's turn. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I guess this makes sense. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And actually that's sorta the way that real Golf works - everybody takes turns. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Though, I guess if you wanted to mess up the guy who's supposed to go after you's game, you certainly could while you were still holding the controller. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, when you start the main story mode, you'll get this introductory cutscene. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And these are done in the exact same style as those of "Valis", right down to that green background. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This guy's mother is dying. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Oh, no! 🍇🍌


🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, I guess he goes out to make his name in the Golf world? 🍇🍌


🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This weird little dude is your trainer, I think. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The story mode basically has you competing with a group of increasingly ridiculous opponents. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Just like "Valis <Two::II>", you can see their stats like Height, Weight, and Power. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This music is *so* dramatic! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Super Albatross", as far as Golf Games go, is... just okay. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It has a [pretty] simple interface, compared to other contemporary Golf Games. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You get to choose clubs and stuff, but you can't adjust, like, the position of your feet, and there is no Power Meter. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Like, literally every Golf Game we've seen in the 'Chron...' series has used some kind of Power Meter, where you have to putt, uh -- press the button at the correct time to get a good swing in. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But here? No, you actually just hold down the button while you're swinging to increase the power. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, the actual Golf Game parts are not exactly terrible, though your ball can get stuck in the trees and [be] really hard to get out. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And the putting green doesn't really look that hot. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, after you've defeated an opponent on the golf course, you will get a cutscene and a new opponent appears. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Including some truly ridiculous foes. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's a cyborg, ... 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 ...a sexy lady wearing a goofy outfit... 🍇🍌


🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 {There} seems to be a lot of emo drama going on, here. 🍇🍌


🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Some [pretty] saxy music, though! 🍇🍌


🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇

🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But yes, this does play kind of like a parody of the overdramatic theatrics of the "Valis {<Two::II>}" cutscenes. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The final boss ends up just being a bald guy in a polo shirt. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, after all, I mean, this is just Golf. 🍇🍌

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 In -- In case you're wondering, 'What does the title "Super Albatross" mean?', well, an 'albatross' is simply a term for what we, in the, uh, U.S., call a 'double eagle' or 'three below par'. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Alright! So the game itself wasn't that great, but, uh, we'll just go [ahead] and end this section with the game's final cutscene. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Momotaro Dentetsu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 September 15 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Hudson game number three is "Super Momotaro Dentetsu". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 [Pretty] cool title screen. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And this music is downright epic! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And this nice little animated intro is [pretty] sweet as well. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Right, so for those of you who don't recall this from past episodes of 'Chrontendo', let me explain what this is. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Momotaro is the, uh, Peach Boy hero of Japanese legend. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 That's why, uh, there's peaches all over this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Anyway, Hudson had put out a "Dragon Quest"-like R.P.G. called "Momotaro Densetsu" (or 'Legend of Momotaro') for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I'm guessing that, uh, someone in the Hudson office cracked a joke one day, and from that was born "Momotaro Dentetsu" (or 'Momotaro's Electric Railway'). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This is the second 'Momotaro Dentetsu' game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The first came out in December of <Nineteen-Eighty-Eight::1988> and we covered it, back in, uh, "Chrontendo Episode <Thirty-Eight::38>". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 However, Hudson continued the 'Super Momotaro' numbering for a bit. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, the next game in the series was "Super Momotaro Dentetsu <Two::2>" and so on, before suddenly switching back to the plain 'Momotaro Dentetsu' in the PlayStation era (uh, starting with "Momotaro Dentetsu <Seven::7>"). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 A lot of changes were made to this game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Graphically, it has been made quite a bit more appealing. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The first game wasn't too [pretty] to look at. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 (I mean, it *was* a FamiCom game.) 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But, by comparison, Hudson just slathers on the animations, the little pop-up illustrations, mini cutscenes, ... 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's obvious that the first one sold [pretty] well, since quite a bit of effort was invested into this. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, let's be frank. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Unless you're reasonably literate in Japanese, you are never going to play this game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, I'll try to make this brief. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They've actually added a ton of stuff to this game, when compared to the first one. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Your basic menu has a few options: 'Dice', 'Card', and 'Help'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 'Dice' rolls the dice, obviously. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This allows you to move around the board. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The object, here, is to take control of the various, uh, train stations, of which there are apparently <seventy-seven::77> in this game, all based on real stations, I'm sure. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There are also cards that you can buy or get, um, which you can actually play from the main menu. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Here I got a, uh, hibernation card. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I think this is used to cause your -- the other player to lose a turn or two. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, basically, ya go around the board, getting money, cards, buying properties, and so on. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Beyond that, the game is somewhat complicated. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Um... There are seasons which cause various seasonal events to occur. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Factors can cause the amount of revenue from property to increase or decrease. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And some properties can actually lose money, I believe. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 All in all, "Super Momotaro Dentetsu" was a big step forward for the series, and created, sort of, the template for future entries. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Uh... And, while we can't really appreciate the finer points on this game, at least we can see how charming it feels. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jūōki 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 September 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Sega 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: NEC Avenue 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Here's a rather unusual one, right here. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Our third and last C.D.-ROM title today is "Jūōki" (or "Altered Beast", as we like to call it in this country). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And yes, it's a Sega game! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And one that was actually a [pretty] major release on Sega's own console. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, the unique thing here, that's not found in other versions, is the Story option. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's not too exciting, though. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's just an extended introduction with heavy narration. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's about maybe five minutes long or so. 🍇🍌


🎧🏮🍊🍓 [Japanese dialogue] 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's mostly just this constant narration over images from either the game or scanned from the game art, which appears on the box. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, it's not really that interesting, but it is an early example of something seen in a lot of P.C. Engine C.D. releases. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They'd put in some kind of, like, animated intro featuring voice samples, created specifically for the P.C. Engine version. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Rise from your grave!". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As for the game itself, you know, well, it's "Altered Beast". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Here's the odd thing. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 N.E.C. published two versions of "Altered Beast", this one - on C.D., and a week later, they put it on a HuCard. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 They're [pretty] similar, except the card version is missing the animated intro thing. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Also, the music is much better on the title screen... um, on the C.D. version. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Uh... Let's take a listen. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Also, the Card version is missing some voice samples. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Um... For example, like "Rise from your grave!". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, we can [pretty] much think of the C.D.-ROM version of "Altered Beast" as a very slightly enhanced version. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But the enhancements are so minimal that it ends up being on a tiny disc. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The C.D. version is [only] around, uh, <ninety-four::94> megabytes in size. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 That's less than a quarter of the size of "Monster Lair", and about one-ninth the size of "<Ease One::Ys I> & <Two::II>". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, it's kind of a shame that there's all this space on the C.D.-ROM, but they're [only] using a tiny fraction of it. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Anyway, the game itself isn't that great. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It looks quite a bit worse than the Genesis port. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's no multi-layer scrolling, for example, and the backgrounds don't look nearly as nice as they do on the Genesis ver... -- on the Genesis version, which was, you know, reasonably accurate to the Arcade version. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But worst of all, the game plays really terrible. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The controls are kind of stiff and, you know, "Altered Beast" is kind of a sluggish game to begin with. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And the janky controls on the P.C. Engine game really do it absolutely no favors. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As a result, the P.C. Engine version is just barely playable, at best. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I have no idea what company was actually responsible for porting this. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Sega's other P.C. Engine ports, such as "Space Harrier" and "Fantasy Zone", were handled by third-party developers. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But this one is actually quite a bit worse than those. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Artist Tool 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 September 29 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: NEC Home Electronics 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I believe the rarest game we're covering today (and maybe one of the rarest games on the P.C. Engine) is this one, here. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 From N.E.C., it's "Artist Tool". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And this is not really a game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's, uh, a piece of very basic drawing software (literally an artist tool, then). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This charming little animated intro sort of explains what it does. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Sort of like a very primitive version of "Mario Paint". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As you might have figured out, this was designed to be used with a small tablet-like accessory, called the 'Illust Booster'. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Additionally, N.E.C. released two other accessories: the Print Booster (which was, I guess, sort of a very basic printer) and something called the Photo Reader (which I'm guessing is some kind of scanner). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, all this shit is actually [pretty] damn rare. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I saw a couple copies of "Artist Tool" on eBay, for, like, <four-fifty - five-hundred dollars::$450 - $500>. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And the peripherals are [pretty] pricey too. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I saw a Print Booster for a couple hundred. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 {I have} no idea about the rest, though. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 {The} thing is, "Artist Tool" doesn't really have that many features. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, it is a *really* basic drawing tool. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Even by <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989> standards, this was sorta lame. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It actually came out a few months before Photoshop, just to give you, sort of, like, a point of reference. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Anyway, it's an intriguing oddity at best. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Double Dungeons 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Cross a Fear" ♪ from "Castlevania Rondo of Blood"

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released: 1989 September 29 🇯🇵 // 1990 July [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by: Masaya 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by: Masaya 🇯🇵 // NEC 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 One last game today, and the final game of September <Nineteen-Eighty-Nine::1989>, "Double Dungeons" (and, just so you know, it sucks). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Double Dungeons" is from N.C.S./Masaya. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Masaya, as you might recall, is just, sort of, like, the brand name that N.C.S. stuck on their video games. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Double Dungeons" is a Dungeon Crawler, in the most literal sense. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The first step is to choose your dungeon. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 (We'll go with number <One::01>, I suppose.) 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Uh... Choose a name, and then... we get a mission briefing. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, uh, we're gonna be finding some treasure! Okay! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, you'd think this is a port of a Japanese Computer game, based on the way it looks (with all, you know, like, that giant game logo taking up the entire bottom-right corner of the screen). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But, as far as I can tell, no; this is a completely original P.C. Engine game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Viewers of 'Chrontendo' will be reminded of that FamiCom Disk System game, "Deep Dungeons". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's a very old old-school style R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The entire thing takes place in a first-person dungeon. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, visually speaking, what you're seeing here right now will never change the entire game. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The game will never deviate from these gray walls/brown floors that we're looking at, here. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, on one hand, "Double Dungeons" is incredibly monotonous visually. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 On the other hand, these scrolling wall effects and turning around corners effects actually look quite nice (certainly better than what we've seen on the FamiCom Dungeon Crawlers). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, the name 'Double Dungeons' refers to the fact that it actually has a <Two::2>-Player mode. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 That -- That's -- The right half of the screen will be devoted to the second player. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 However, if you think this sounds cool, then just beware there are some bizarre choices the game makes that you might not like. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And you and your friend would have to be [pretty] bored to pick up this game and start playing it. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, you roam around killing a variety of slimes, spiders, bees, and so on - gradually gaining levels. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, on occasion, you'll get, like, a message which says, 'Think', which supposedly is, like, a cue to move backwards and perhaps avoid the monster's attack. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Though I'm not really sure if that actually does anything - or if it's just some kind of random meaningless message. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The object is simply to roam around and collect experience and gold. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 This guy, uh, the sorcerer, is sort of a mini-boss. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 He was originally gua... -- guarding a treasure chest, but (like every other monster) he respawns, so you can kill him over and over again. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And he seems to be the best source for grinding for experience on the first level. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You get a lot of cute little messages when you're fighting. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But they really just, sort of, appear randomly and don't seem to mean anything (other than the ones, of course, you know, telling you how much damage you did). 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You can spend your gold in the shop for better weapons and armor, or you can buy a health-restoring potions. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Enemies sometimes drop similar things, but there's really not much along the lines of loot in "Double Dungeons". 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Certain parts of the maze will contain a strong enemy, which acts kind of like a choke point. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Ah... For example, in the first dungeon, there's a single hallway, which leads to the southeast quadrant, which is blocked by a surprisingly strong enemy called a Marsh Snake. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 After him, there's another tough dude in the hallway - a Hawk. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Defeating him allows you to enter the last area, and (assuming that you have the key) you could enter the boss's room. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 One thing to realize is there's no, sort of, strategy to fighting; it's literally pressing the button over and over again. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 There's no magic spells; if your health gets low, you can use a healing item, but you have no visible stats, other than your level. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Obviously, uh, more expensive weapons do some more damage (I assume). 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But whenever I bought a new weapon, the effects weren't immediately obvious. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 After I bought the Short Sword, I was, uh, [pretty] much found myself still doing <one::1> Damage with most attacks. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Once you defeat the boss, you get this rather curious screen, which gives you the password input, <Number-One::NUMBER01>, and shows you the number <Two::'2'>. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You then get an epilogue, which basically explains that you killed the <quote-unquote mime::"mime"> and returned the treasure. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Then (this is where things get weird) you get returned back to the title screen, which takes you back to the Dungeon Select. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 You then get -- put in your name again, and you enter the next dungeon you choose - back at Level <One::1> with no gold, experience, or items. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Yes, you see, each dungeon is a completely independent game, unconnected to any of the others. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, now you're back to fighting slimes and spiders, just like you were. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And, of course, you need to once again save up and buy swords. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Now, each dungeon gets bigger and you encounter progressively stronger monsters. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, over the game, you'll basically end each dungeon at a higher level and with better armor. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But since this resets after each boss, you won't really, sort of, feel any sense of progress throughout the game because you lose everything once you defeat the boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, I guess you could simply play the last level if you want to see the game's ending. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But really, the first zillion levels don't do anything that you can't -- that you can't do in the last level. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 But the [only] thing preventing you from doing that is that it requires a password. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And you see, each level gives you one character of the password. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, playing through each level will give you the password to enter the final level. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, the [only] point for the ent... -- for the first <ninety-five-percent::95%> of the game is just basically getting a password for the last level. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As I mentioned, "Double Dungeon" has no sense of role-playing or strategy or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's literally just about grinding your way through a huge dungeon. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The [only] audience who would enjoy this would be, like, the folks who like to draw out big maps. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's basically a dungeon exploration game. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The maps are vital since there's really [pretty] much no visible -- visual cues as to where you are, when you're roaming around the dungeon. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And the dungeons get way too big to memorize. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The last few dungeons are just incredibly huge. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I'm estimating the final dungeon has somewhere between <four-hundred 'n' five-hundred::400 [and] 500> monsters in it. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, you'll need tons of graph paper to map this thing out. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 So, if you play these kind of games primarily for the enjoyment of, like, you know, slowly plotting out a huge map, and you love to do tons of repetitive grinding, then give this a shot. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Everyone else, I would recommend you stay away. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 5 Wrap Up ✨


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 And there we have it! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Kind of an odd assortment of games today. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 The Best Title released? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I'll say, uh, "Bloody Wolf". 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's certainly the most creative fully-formed game this time. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I mean, sure, it's an Arcade port, but I'd say the P.C. Engine port is actually an improvement on the original. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 As for the Worst Game? - Hard to say. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 "Rock-On" maybe? 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I like Shoot-'em-Ups, but this one is just... lame. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 It's so lame! 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Next up, we're gonna have a new 'Chrontendo', but when we do eventually return to 'Chronturbo', we'll reach early December. 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 I hope you like C.D.-ROM titles that aren't actually real video games, because we've got one of those coming up, as well as a Golf Game and (I believe) *two* Mahjong Games... in a row! 🍇

🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 We'll see how I hold out. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 On the other hand, we have a very cool "...Zelda..."-style game from Hudson. 🍇🍌


🤖🦦🤫🍊🍓 Anyway, we'll see ya then. 🍇🍌
