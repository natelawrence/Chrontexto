👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 27 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 1987 is it last coming to an end. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, it's been the biggest year ever for the FamiCom, with around 195 games released. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And we've got one more week worth of games left, including a huge one from (who else?) Konami. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So let's go ahead and get started. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 GeGeGe Kitaro 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! The sun shines on a bright new episode of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we are December 22nd for the last few games of 1987. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Our first title is "GeGeGe no Kitaro 2" from Bandai. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Let me start out by saying this is a [pretty] cool opening sequence. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know who developed this game, but so far so good. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "GeGeGe no Kitaro [2]" is, of course, the long-running manga and anime series about a Yokai, which is a particular kind of Japanese ghost. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The series is quite popular in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might remember we saw the very first guitar game from "Chrontendo Episode 8". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That was one of the earliest post-"...Mario..." side-scrollers for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was a [pretty] basic game - sort of, run around, and choose different levels, and shoot stuff. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But naturally, things have changed in the last year and a half and the simple Platformer games are no longer in vogue. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So it turns out the second turtle game is, in fact, a "...Zelda"-esque R.P.G.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Seriously, what else would you expect? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now we have an unofficial English translation patch, which is quite good and one of the people involved also translated the "Middleton saga". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's great the pokes are working to make these games accessible to more people. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I called this an R.P.G. but basically it -- it's probably influenced as much by "...Zelda" as by "Dragon Quest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The battles are turn-based and they're surprisingly fully-animated! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kitaro will run forward and attack enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And when it's best we avoid the maze attack you'll see him dart to the side. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 However the R.P.G. elements have been simplified quite a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You do get Experience Points, you Level Up and learn magic, you will have attack and defense stats, but there is no money or shops involved. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are items but no equipable weapons or armor, exactly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Healing items are dropped by enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So you don't worry about inventory or anything like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One of the first things you find is Toros house there, you can rest and replenish your health for free. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There aren't any real villages or anything and not much in terms of N.P.C.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so I've just Leveled Up and obtained the hare noodle spell, which is simply a more powerful attack that uses Magic Points. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll go ahead and use it against this guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now one annoying thing: Kitaro seems somewhat padded because you actually Level Up very slowly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most enemies will grant you a measly One experience point. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even tougher enemies you face later don't really get much more experience. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here we're about to find the first castle was the first boss was found. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It means are tackled, by the way, one at a time, meaning they do encounter a group you'll battle each one separately one after the other. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yes, and I hate this you often both fight enemies and having escaped right before you defeat them - robbing you of some experience. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 These guys were, sort of, tough yet you still [only] get one experience point for each one you defeat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Don't they know that's against R.P.G. rules? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tougher enemies are supposed to give more experience! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Combat (even against the bosses) is quite simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You really just need to hit them with your strongest attack over and over. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Ah! There's the first boss, right there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If necessary, you can use a healing item. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Either you've Leveled Up enough to defeat the boss or you're not; there's really not much in strategy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This guy will be able to gigantic 10 Experience Points, as well as an item that supposedly increases your attack. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Just like in "Dragon Quest (I)" you have to use torches to see your way around dungeons. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This isn't really quite a dungeon as much as a tunnel to move from one area to the next. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One weird thing: When you're on the overworld, you'll encounter these weird force fields that prevent you from passing the certain areas. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game calls them Yokai storms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When you first encounter a Yokai stone, it looks like a glitch, as the screen like flashes a very irritating fashion. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The video can't actually capture it quickly flashing effects tend to get lost in videos. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But when you saw me walk around like in the black screen there a second ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's the pattern you see flashing on and off very quickly, while playing the game in this area. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I just got the second-party member. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though they don't really function like regular party members - more like magic spells; you can use them during battle and they have special abilities. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now it turns out that the tune was caused by floating rock. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Defeating it will then, sort of, lie to access new areas you couldn't get to earlier because of the storm. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually for that the game you will travel around Japan and even to Korea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "...Kitaro 2" is not really a bad game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's pleasantly competent for a "...Zelda"/"Dragon Quest" mash-up produced by Bandai. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's some things I don't like (such as slow experience gathering and the fact that it's difficult to find your way around on the overworld). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I was expecting much worse! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Piccari Games 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Jesus! It's sequel-mania, here on 'Chrontendo'! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 From Namco, we have "Pro Yakou "Family Stadium" '87", which is obviously a sequel to "Pro Yakou "Family Stadium" from December 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That game was released in the U.S. by Tengen as "RBI Baseball" in 1988, one of the few licensed titles from Tengen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, much like the first 'Family Stadium' game, you select from several vaguely described Japanese teams. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though everything here is supposedly based on real team players and each player has their own distinct stats. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can play against the Computer, against other Person, or enter the Watch Mode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those of you who have played "RBI Baseball" or remember "Chrontendo Episode 13", where we played the first game, will say, this looks exactly like that game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's because "Family Stadium '87" is a slightly updated version of that first game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The graphics, gameplay, ...all that is virtually exactly the same! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A very few minor changes have been made. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (There are new teams, for example.) 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is really a revision of the first game rather than a brand new title. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Thankfully, these weren't quite full price games, the sticker price was 3900 yen, as opposed to 5300 or 5500 most games cost back then. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But either way, Madden NFL definitely would not meant to practice releasing similar games each year. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, in case you're wondering, was this game released in the U.S.? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, no, not really. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Tengan did release an "RBI Baseball 2", in 1990 I think, but this seems to have been developed internally. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was definitely not the same game as "Pro Yakyou '87". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, uh, some graphics were carried over from the first "RBI Baseball" (like the Baseball diamond background) so you can definitely see some similarities. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But 'Family Stadium' and 'RBI Baseball' became two different series after the first game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game was very successful in Japan. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Both of the first two games made that 'Famitsu Top 100' list from last episode. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One interesting thing (kind of a little bug, I suppose) - I noticed it was possible to, sort of, spam the Computer's batters by throwing lots of knuckle balls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They frequently strike out on knuckle balls, for some reason. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, there you have it. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Good going, Namco! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess we'll see the same game again in 1988. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Metal Gear 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 22 🇯🇵 // 1988 June [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here we go! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last big game of 1987 - the one that kicked off the series still going strong today, the original "Metal Gear", released by Konami in Japan, as seen on the title screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., "Metal Gear" was released in 1988 by Ultra, with this slightly different title screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And in Europe, it was released by Palcom - but more about that later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this is not really the original "Metal Gear"! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, the familiar N.E.S. version was a port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The original "Metal Gear" was released for the M.S.X. 2 computers in July of 1987. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A number of changes were made. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So we're going to take an unusual step here by examining both versions together. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the M.S.X. version, it sports better graphics, for one and also a completely different beginning. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Solid Snake infiltrates Outer Heaven via water, armed with [only] a pack of cigarettes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 (How do they keep dry, I wonder?). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Metal Gear" has a lot of dialogue, in the form of radio transmissions between Snake and Big boss and other operatives. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Big boss gives you mission briefings, tips, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Right away, he advises you not to let the guards see ya. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Metal Gear" is what you call a Stealth Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can attack guards, but if you cross their line of sight, the alert is sounded and more guards rush in and you may get killed very quickly. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Metal Gear" was created by a young game designer, named Hideo Kojima. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He was responsible for the M.S.X. version, but the FamiCom port was handled by a completely different team at Konami, who altered Kojima's game in several ways. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The FamiComm game (seen here) begins with Snake and three other guys parachuting into the jungle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Snake will then need to cross several screens, before reaching Outer Heaven. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The English text in the N... -- N.E.S. version is notoriously bad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'I fell asleep' being, sort of, one of the classic examples of bad game translation. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This new introductory sequence is not really as well constructed as the rest of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, you have to bypass some dogs, who will always wake up when you go by, and at certain moment it's virtually impossible to avoid getting shot by the guards. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll need to scrounge around for rations and key cards, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will also have to do a bit of traveling around in these trucks. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's one annoyance; when ya exit this truck, there's a guard standing right outside - and he's [pretty] much impossible to avoid, as he rushes right towards you. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, while not exactly bad, this rather inartfully designed beginning sets the FamiCom "Metal Gear" off on kind of a bad foot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you enter in the front door of Outer Heaven, the two versions become almost identical for a while. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know - funny, we see all these tanks and vehicles inside [of] Outer Heaven, but never a door big enough to actually get a tank to pass through. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As mentioned, "Metal Gear" has you avoiding enemies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This might be the first widely popular Stealth Game but other games existed before this one. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the very first being "Castle Wolfenstein" (the original "Castle Wolfenstein") an Apple II game from 1981, in which you need to escape from a castle while avoiding detection by Nazis. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though Kojima changed the setting to one a bit more influenced by American action movies, such as "Escape from New York" and "The Terminator". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, seen side by side for the millionth time, is the cover art from "Metal Gear" and this photo of Kyle Reese from "The Terminator". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, Snake's appearance has changed a bit since then. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Going back to the M.S.X. game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's another array that's different. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The clearing inside the base where you find some trucks and the first key card. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Key cards are a vital part of this game virtually every door is locked and requires a certain key card to open. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This gives "Metal Gear" a certain "Metroid" feel. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You find locked doors that can't be opened until you come back later with the right card. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Also crucial: rescuing P.O.W.s held inside Outer Heaven. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from giving out plot details, the P.O.W.s will increase your rank - which will, in turn, increase your Life Bar and the amount of rations and ammo you can carry. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe that you actually need to be at Rank 4, in order to finish the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there are a lot of items to carry in "Metal Gear", most of which are mandatory for certain areas. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The gas mask, for example, is required to cross gas-filled rooms. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also need a compass, bombs, an oxygen tank, and various other inventory items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Metal Gear" is notable for the sheer amount of weapons and gear you have to acquire. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Big boss rather conveniently forgets to tell you several rather important things in this game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another very cool item is guidable missiles - needed, for example, to take out the control panels on electric floors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These things are very useful, actually. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe that Big boss forgets to tell you about the electric floors, as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And also in this game, we have the debut of that "Metal Gear" favorite, the cardboard box. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Good thing everyone in Outer Heaven is really stupid. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the box is actually good when you're trying to avoid getting seen by a video camera as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Lines of sight are very important in this game, you can often stand right next to an enemy without being detected, as long as you are not directly in front of them. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there is another video game cliche that makes, sort of, an early appearance, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At a certain point, you will automatically get captured and all your equipment is taken away. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You know, despite being one of the world's greatest super spies, Snake tends to get captured a lot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As it turns out, you had reached, sort of, a dead end at this point and getting captured rather conveniently takes you to another part of the base, which you wouldn't otherwise be able to reach. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Since "Metal Gear"s from 1987, naturally you'll escape from your prison cell by finding the hidden door. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you've escaped, you'll come across the first boss, a guy called Shoot Gunner. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This looks hopeless, but it turns out all your weapon supplies are stashed in a nearby unlocked room. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If I were a video game bad guy and I captured the hero, I'd immediately have all this stuff tossed into the incinerator. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bosses in "Metal Gear" are a little odd. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They often seem difficult at first glance, but actually are very simple to defeat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 With, uh, Shoot Gunner, for example, you can just hide behind the crates and fire missiles at him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The bosses tend to be a little disappointing, as they require virtually no skill to defeat. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One difference in the, uh, layout of the M.S.X. and the [NES] version is this screen, right here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You actually have to, sort of, run through this little maze, avoid dogs, and blow holes in walls. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the N.E.S. version, it's just regular standard rooms. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, eventually we'll make our way to the roof and cross this treacherous bridge. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 At this point in the N.E.S. game, you will find Twin Shot (two brothers with machine guns). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Again, they're very simple; you can take them out in space standing in the right spot and tossing grenades at 'em. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing about the -- the N.E.S. version - it's a lot easier than the M.S.X. game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The guards in the N.E.S. game are much slower and, uh, less aggressive. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Getting spotted in the M.S.X. version will r... -- usually result in you taking a whole lot of bullets. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These jetpack guys, for example, they are all over you in the M.S.X. game, but [pretty], uh, much harmless in the FamiCom game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And instead of Twin Shot, the original boss here was a HIND-D helicopter (maybe inspired by the movie "Rambo"?). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As always, this guy turns out to be a cakewalk. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After defeating him, you need to use a parachute to jump off the roof and land in the yard to get Key 4. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's really nothing like this part in the N.E.S. version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Keycard forest found in a truck outside the compound. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can actually obtain it at the very beginning of the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And of course, we cannot discuss the two "Metal Gear"s without mentioning one tiny little fact. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The console port is inferior in almost every single way to the original. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The M.S.X. game obviously features much better graphics. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The N.E.S. also suffers, um, from some rather ugly colors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The better visual and music gives the M.S.X. release, uh, a lot more atmosphere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You also don't have to go through menus to bring up weapons and items. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It can be, you know, just one keystroke. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's a major change in the N.E.S. game, which we'll see a little bit later. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In either version, "Metal Gear" features more of a plot than most other video games at this time. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game does start messing with you - like Big boss advises, uh, you to do some other stupid things - like getting into the truck that he tells you to will actually take you back to the beginning of the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And later on, he even commands you to abort the mission. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The M.S.X. version goes even so far as to, kind of, break the fourth wall at one point when Big boss tells you to turn off your M.S.X.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Kojima was really, sort of, pulling weird stuff like this, even in his very first game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So going back to the plot, once you found Gray Fox, he'll point you in the direction of the scientist who actually invented Metal Gear. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will then need to move on to another building behind the main compound, and find the scientist's kidnapped daughter, and, uh, cross a scorpion-filled desert, and fight two androids (called Arnolds!) as well as a boomerang-wielding nutso, called Coward Duck, who has the Final Key card. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, "Metal Gear" falls into a particular category of Konami games - that would be, sort of, the top-down flip screen Action Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, see also "King Kong II", "Love Warrior Nicole", and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It does change the formula a bit, with its heavy dialogue, its emphasis on stealth, plot twists, and "Metroid"-like level design. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The whole game is actually just to one large level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's perhaps the most hated part of the game right there - those awful booby traps in the floor. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually, you'll find another Fox Hound agent and discover that, yes, Big boss is a traitor, and he's the one actually behind Outer Heaven and Metal Gear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And finally, you face Metal Gear itself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to blow it up by, uh, attaching 16 explosives to its feet in a particular order. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then, just like "Metroid", you've gotta make a mad dash to the exit, before the whole base blows up. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now here comes the most baffling change in The console version. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the FamiCom game you blow up, not Metal Gear, but actually a giant computer. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, Metal Gear is missing from the game "Metal Gear". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What was the reasoning behind that decision? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Who knows? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then, 'Surprise!', you must defeat Big boss before you can escape. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once again, the difficulty has been toned down quite a bit for the FamiCom. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Actually, everything has, sort of, been dumbed-down in the FamiCom game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even the ending is a little lame. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You need to choose between three exits. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the M.S.X. game there are three ladders (two of which lead to a dead end). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the FamiCom version, well, you know, it's odd; there's a three elevators but the wrong two simply keep ascending up and up indefinitely until the timer runs out and you die. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This makes really no sense at all. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, how can one elevator have a shorter path to the surface? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now while the M.S.X. game is better, it's certainly not perfect, by any means. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, having to constantly try out every single key card, whenever you want to open a door, gets real tiring real quickly. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's easy to get lost in Outer Heaven. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 A map would have been nice. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the console version is still very well-designed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's inventive and it's still a fun game; it's just not as good as the original. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the final cutscene in the M.S.X. version is super cool! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems like every Konami game ends like this - the base blows up. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this case, Outer Heaven actually blows up twice. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After "Metal Gear" Kojima mostly stuck with designing games for the M.S.X.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 His next project be a very interesting little Adventure Game, called "Snatcher". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, finally, in 1990, a sequel for "Metal Gear" for the M.S.X., called "Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake", would come out. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this game is really a major step forward over "Metal Gear". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Metal Gear 2..." is really a [pretty] fantastic-looking game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [It] plays a lot like a 2D version of "Metal Gear Solid"! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it has some great features, like an in-game map! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can actually play both M.S.X. games in the release of "Metal Gear Solid 3", known as "Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence" for the PlayStation 2. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the U.S., Konami released "Metal Gear" as the first game on its Ultra label. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo's licensing agreement for the N.E.S., in the United States, allowed a publisher [only] five games a year, but a special exception was made for Konami, which allowed them to release another five games, under the Ultra name. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Sadly, "Metal Gear 2..." was never ported to the console and a rather inferior sequel, called "Snake's Revenge" was, uh, created for the U.S. market, with no input from kijima. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, 1987 has been a fantastic year for Konami and "Metal Gear" is the cherry on top! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And well, we'll actually see their first game of 1988, later this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Magnum Kiki Ippatsu: Empire City - 1931 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 25 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Seibu Kaihatsu 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toshiba EMI 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Something we don't see too much of nowadays is a straightforward Arcade port. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here's "Magnum Kiki Ippatsu: Empire City - 1931", from Toshiba, EMI. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 'MAGNUM Kiki Ippatsu' might mean something like 'Magnum in the Nick of Time'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In case you're wondering, that secret - that's your password, [only] four letters! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Empire City looks and plays like a Light Gun game, but it isn't. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Essentially it's a Light Gun Game that uses the D-Pad instead. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Arcade game was released in 1986 and goes by the name simply of, uh, "Empire City: 1931" was created by Seibu Kaihatsu, who are mostly known for their series of 'Raiden' Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was distributed by Taito (and Romstar in the U.S.). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom version never had a U.S. release. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, like so many other Japanese titles, it was considered. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 An ad for "Rambo" in the July issue of 'Nintendo Fun Club News' announces it as 'Coming Soon', along with "Airwolf" and something called "WWF Superstars", which presumably was the game released is "WWF Wrestlemania". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It also is mentioned in the Game Pak Round-up in the next issue of 'Nintendo Power'. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so, about the game itself. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it's a decent entry in the Shoot Gangsters genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We've already seen several games like this; "Hogan's Alley" had very similar sequence. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Gangster Town" for the Sega Master System was another very similar idea, though that game was much more frantically paced. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here, gangsters will appear in doorways and windows... and, on occasion, one will appear off-screen and start shooting at you while running. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You will need to hurry up and find him and shoot him before he takes you out. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Everything is reasonably well illustrated. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The gangsters are stylishly drawn and assume dramatic poses when shot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are a limited number of levels and they repeat. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have to play the same levels over and over again to finish the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though, there's a weird thing! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Superman suddenly appears (a rather bizarre coincidence, because you also have the "Superman" game this episode). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, all in all, not a bad game - [it] might have made more sense as a Light Gun Game, but the D-Pad works reasonably well. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Attack Animal Gakuen 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 26 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Scitron & Art 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And after that, let's switch gears a bit to this piece of junk, "Attack Animal Gakuen" (or 'Animal Attack Academy'). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Look familiar? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, this is a "Space Harrier" clone, or maybe a "3D WorldRunner" clone - or some combination, most likely. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game is from Pony Canyon and was apparently built by Citron and Art. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Citron being a record label specialized in video game soundtracks; I guess they got development, uh, for a little while. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'll admit the music is catchy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But the game... well, it's a lame "Space Harrier" clone with a wacky theme. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You see, you're a schoolgirl in a sailor outfit (who can fly) and you are battling animals which have turned against humanity... I think. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, they're very hard-to-hit in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And they'll collide these sooner than you think (once they've reached about three quarters of the screen depth towards you) so be careful! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the first boss was apparently... a ma... -- machine-gun-toting koala? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You might think this sounds, sort of, cool, but really it's not. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This game would be an example of the typical Japanese 'wacky' game design. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 While some excellent games have been made in the style (think of "Parodius") it does, more often, seem to be used to try to disguise a lack of good gameplay. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Low budget titles like this will, you know, sort of, lack anything to distinguish the game in terms of quality, so they'll throw in some cactuses with hats to distract gamers. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So if you're looking for a dull goofy "Space Harrier" clone, "Attack Animal Gakuen" is your game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Superman 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 26 🇯🇵 // 1988 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Kemco 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is a little-loved licensed title from Kemco, "Superman", based on... well, 'Superman'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note the music playing here and the credit to First Star. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Superman looks very young and very pissed-off in this game, as he should be. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kemco naturally released "Superman" in the U.S., but with different music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Does this sound, sort of, familiar? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it should be. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We heard it just a few episodes ago, in the Kemco R.P.G. "indoor no Ikari". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Japanese version used a version of the, uh, John Williams Superman Theme from the "Superman" movie. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I assume Kemco didn't want or couldn't get the rights to the music for the U.S. release. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some graphical changes were made as well. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Superman sprite as a smaller head and a less furious facial expression. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and what about the American way? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, dear God! That is one freaky-looking Statue of Liberty. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The statue actually speaks to Superman? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Yeah, this game is nothing less than good old-fashioned kusoge (delivered to Western gamers, for a change). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Superman, I guess falls into the category of a side-scrolling Action Adventure Game with very light R.P.G. elements. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though that description makes it sound better than it really is. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Granted, Kemco's original titles aren't really known for their high-quality, but their production values here are surprisingly bad! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The other characters and various N.P.C.s are really ugly-looking (even for a 1987 game)! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And why does the background go black whenever any text appears, there had to be a better solution to putting text into the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, one nice thing about the game is there is actually a handy map screen. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Superman's game world consists of several long horizontal levels connected by an underground passage or subway line. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, Superman is supposedly a crime fighter yet his hometown Metropolis is depicted as being probably the most violent crime-filled city in human history (with the exception of the cities in Towa Chiki's "Sherlock Holmes..." game). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You literally cannot step out of the Daily Planet building and onto the street without gangsters shooting at you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Hell! They start shooting at you, even when you're still dressed as Clark Kent. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You would think the local presence of Superman would deter crime just a little bit, but no, it seems that gangsters have completely taken over the city. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There is a logical reason for this, however. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In this game, Superman is really not that super. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He can be killed by bullets, can't fly very well, and it takes about three punches to knock out a normal human. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The player's goal, here, is to follow the leads given to you by the N.P.C.s, which usually involves entering a certain building. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The majority of gameplay involves walking (yes, walking) from one location to the other. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Constantly walking back and forth over the same streets makes this a [pretty] monotonous game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Those little things that pop out of enemies will refill your superpower (that is your Health) except the red or green ones; those are kryptonite. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The other icons (like the one I caught a second ago, right there) those are actually your superpowers, which are confusingly called 'Item Power' in the game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These operate just like magic spells in most R.P.G.s. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Superman has very limited flying abilities but if your F... -- Flight Meter is full enough, you can fly to the nearby locations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is done by accessing the map. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you can't just fly anywhere, so most of the time to men travels on-foot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, here is Zaora, the first boss; I was using my Heat Vision a bit against her. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Superman" doesn't exactly contain great boss battles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, I know that video game localization was a relatively new concept, at the time, but, uh, this game does have a lot of weird issues. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like, seriously, 'Daily Planets'? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And 'Superman defeats [the] Zod Gang.'? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They are the Final bosses in the game, not the boss I just defeated! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Did [Kemco] U.S.A. not have a QA department? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unlike, say, 'Batman', 'Superman' has not had a very successful career in video games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this one right here is not the first 'Superman' game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That honor belongs to Atari's "Superman" from 1978. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Atari game (while quite dated-looking today) was, in fact, extremely innovative on a number of levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Aside from being the first game based on a licensed property. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There was also a Computer Game published by First Star (the same guys did "Spy vs. Spy"). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Kemco apparently had to get the rights for a 'Superman' game from them, despite this not being a part of that game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game is really not very faithful to the original conception of Superman. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, like, random N.P.C.s will actually insult you and threaten you on the streets. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That would be completely insane! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And to get around town more quickly, you take... the subway? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really, no wonder no one's scared of this guy! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, look how short he was in that subway scene! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why didn't they make the other figures the same, uh, scale as Superman? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, in Part 2 Superman is investigating a stock market crash, engineered by a Chinese gang. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here he's using his super breath to put out fires. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I just got a..., sort of, a power-up, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And you really must have balls of steel to insult Superman's costume to his face, like this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, while the controls and combat are very simple, the game has some weird ideas about hit detection, as I'm sure you've noticed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can punch an enemy from some distance. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, you actually have to do that if you don't want to, uh, take any damage. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Superman" is definitely not the worst game on the system, but it is quite bad. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And its, sort of, reckless handling of the 'Superman' mythos is [pretty] amusing. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose it's not nearly the disaster of, uh, "Superman 64". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, I'm sure it's difficult to make a game about a guy who's invincible, but Kemco's solution (turning Superman into, sort of, a wuss) is probably not the best idea. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Trainer: Totsugeki! Fuun Takeshijou 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 December 28 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So here we are - the last Japanese game of 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's another 'Family Trainer' game from Bandai! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a weird one, because it's the first 'Family Trainer' game to be based on an existing property (namely the 'Takeshi's Castle' T.V. show, which ran from 1986 to 1989, in Japan). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This was one of those crazy and dangerous-looking, uh Game Shows that Japan was infamous for, back then. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Contestants had to do a number of difficult physical challenges that usually into them falling into a water tank. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The idea was to storm the castle, which belonged none other than Takeshi Kitano himself. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So there are now two Takeshi Kitano games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first one being Taito's infamous "Takeshi no Chousenjou". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, many of you in the U.S. will recognize this as being the show that the 'Most Extreme Elimination Challenge' was based on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are several short challenges, based on events from the original show. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Most are based on running and jumping on the mat and your score on how quickly you complete them. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some of these are actually a bit difficult to figure out - like this one, for example; I couldn't keep from falling off the bridge. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Something very interesting about the game; it was built by Human (who did all those other 'Family Trainer' games). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, if you've ever wondered as to how long the development cycle was for FamiCom games, back then, well, it was actually sometimes very short. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In an interview with Toshi Akashi, formerly of Human (or rather Sonata, as it was actually called, back in 1987) was published on the Game Developers Research Institute not that long ago, in which Akashi states that the game was developed in one month. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We now think of games as taking at least a year or two to make, so the fact this was programmed in one month is [pretty] amazing! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the eighth 'Family Trainer' game, and if you're getting sick of them, well rejoice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's [only] a few more and it's actually going to be quite a while before we see the next one, so the series is very clearly winding down. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Densetsu no Kishi: Elrond 🇯🇵 // Wizards and Warriors 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 July 15 🇯🇵 // 1987 December [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Rare 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 // Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Before we close out 1987, we have one last straggler - a U.S. released from Acclaim that came out sometime in December. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh how cute! It's got a high score screen. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And look at that; the game was developed by Rare. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the second N.E.S. game by Rare, and incidentally the first original N.E.S. title from Acclaim. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, "Wizards & Warriors" might be the first completely Western-originated N.E.S. game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I don't know LJN's "Gotcha" game was developed by a Japanese company, but "Jaws" and "Karate Kid" were, so it's likely "Gotcha" was too. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So "Wizards & Warriors" has some big shoes to fill. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 How does it do? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, opinions on this game are mixed. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Boy! Someone chopped down a lot of trees! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I think they may have chopped them down, closer to the ground, as well. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Of course, that's just one of the many things that make no sense. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Like that Eagle that just, sort of, sits on a tree stump shooting fireballs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I mean, come on! It's a bird! It should be flying, right? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, here's the story. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You're a knight, out to rescue some kidnapped Princesses. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you can't just go directly to [???] castle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No, you need to tunnel underneath the ground and come out on the other side of the castle! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But at various points you're blocked by another knight who demands 100 jewels to let you pass! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, your knight needs to jump around and collect 100 jewels in every level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first level (the forest level) has you jumping on tree tops and looking inside hollow tree trunks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, aside from jewels, you'll wanna grab any keys you find. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This will like open up a chest the same color, um, except that you don't actually use the keys to unlock chests. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No. If you find a blue key, and you come [across] a blue chest, the chest will already be unlocked and open. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's almost kinda like finding the blue key automatically opens all the chests by remote control. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now one thing: This game actually come out in Japan, with a slightly different title screen, under the name "Densetsu no Kishi: Elrond", but some changes were made. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Namely, where's all the enemies? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, they removed the enemies except the ones that are inside the tree trunks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, sort of, the display was changed as well, a bit. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe they figured Japanese gamers would be somewhat irritated by the placement, which tends to have a lot of little flying enemies coming at you completely unexpected random angles. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The sword you start out with is [pretty] much worthless so it's a good idea to, sort of, pick up some better weapons by looking in the chests. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so once you've got enough jewels, go to the Red Knight and he'll let ya pass. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But you know what? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 He didn't actually take any of the jewels! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I still have like 145 jewels after I went past the Red Knight. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Why do you demand 100 jewels and then let me pass without taking any? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, at any rate, at this point, we drop down to the trunk and meet the first boss. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and getting that, uh, Dagger of Throwing will be quite helpful for this boss. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 A few things about "Wizards & Warriors" - Well, it's an ugly game; that's for sure! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The color scheme is certainly, uh, worse than most N.E.S. games of this era. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rare seems to have a real fondness for baby blue, red, light purple, and Pepto-Bismol pink. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So many enemies (like even the eagles and spiders) are pink. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Rare doesn't seem to realize you could actually make things more than one color. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 All those years of working on the Spectrums must be responsible. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh yeah, and I love the fact that, like, we -- (as you saw a second ago) when you find your Princess, they're all tied up in in their underwear. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, from here on you move out to underground cave level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And after this there's another cave level, and then two more cave levels, and then... a forest level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Then you move on to the castle. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so this is, sort of, a terrible game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But one other thing - what's with the name? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 [The] box art depicts, like, an actual Warrior dude, and the bad guy is a Wizard. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But 'Wizards & Warriors' is an inappropriate name for a game that's about a knight. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that's, sort of, a Rare tradition, I guess. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Sabrewulf" didn't really seem to be about a wolf or a saber. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Knight Lore", on the other hand, is about a werewolf but is short on knights. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game has a knight but not too many wizards or warriors. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rare has some rather odd naming conventions. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably the best thing about this game is the music from David Wise. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This must have sold well, as there were two sequels, but, uh, one gets to feeling Rare hasn't quite gotten the hang of making N.E.S. games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to 1988 ✨


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We are finally at January 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Obviously the release schedule slows down this early in the year, but we still got some interesting stuff going on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 If anything, 1998 is even bigger than 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll see the biggest-selling standalone title ever for the system, as well as the game that ranks as the #2 bestseller for the FamiCom in Japan. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In the United States 1988 was the year that the N.E.S. went from being a very successful video game console to a cultural phenomenon, with the early sales reaching the billion dollar mark. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it all begins rather humbly. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Family Circuit 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 January 06 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Game Studio 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Didn't we just see "Family Stadium '87"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And now it's another entry in Namco's 'Family Sports' series. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But this time it's "Family Circuit" - a Racing Game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though I did like Namco's spiffy little intro there a second ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They kick off from 1988 with a splash. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Note Game Studio's name in the credits. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As is expected, various menu options let you choose the type of race, type of car, even the car's color scheme! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can also adjust various functional elements of the car - acceleration, handling, and so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's interesting to [observe] that a lot of menus and options are slowly becoming standard for such things as Racing Games (as in Taito's "...Grand Prix" from last episode). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, unlike "Taito Grand Prix", this is a top-down Racing Game - sorta like Nintendo's "FamiCom Grand Prix F1 Race" from October 1987. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game must hold the record for 'least convincing depiction of crowd spectators'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's really not how you're supposed to do it, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Family Stadium", uh, has, sort of, a "Pole Position"-like qualifying Time Trial. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you do well, you get a better starting position. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And the handling does take some getting used to, as I discovered there just a moment ago. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is the simplest track and they're all named after real locations. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I believe the final track is Daytona. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though I'm not sure if the tracks are actually based on the real race tracks. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You don't normally see that sort of, like, uh, lifelike detail in a Racing Game from 1988. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Developer Game Studio is, of course, Masanobu Endô's company. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Last episode, we saw their version of "Wizardry". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, they must have been [pretty] busy around this time! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, this is certainly not a bad game, by any means. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not terribly fond of top-down Racing Games, but the sheer amount of customization [???] gives this a bit of an edge over similar games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oddly, there have been a lot of Racing Games for the FamiCom, but they're almost never released, in the U.S.. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really sure why. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Next month, Nintendo released a top-down Racing Game in the U.S. [only]. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So I suppose that Japan and the U.S. were considered to have different tastes in Racing Games, or something like that. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I'd say that in terms of, sort of, general gameplay, I actually prefer this over the Nintendo top-down Racing Game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And if you actually win, of course, you get to stand around, uh, throwing bottles of champagne everywhere. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There have been a lot of Racing Games lately! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We're actually gonna see one next episode and then the episode after that, as well. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Satsui no Kaiso: Power Soft Satsujin Jiken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 January 07 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Hyperware 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by HAL Laboratory 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, we just started 1988 and already we've got another Murder Mystery Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This is "Satsui no Kaiso: powersoft Satsujin Jiken" - published by HAL and apparently developed by a little-known company called Hyperware. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What does the title mean, exactly? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, I'm not quite sure. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Though Google mysteriously translates it as "Hierarchy of the Night", though I'm really not quite sure about that. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game seems a lot like any other Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You have your menu-based commands that you access with a D-Pad. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Is this genre already becoming a little bit stagnant? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So far, Nintendo seems to be the [only] one that's really trying to shake it up a bit, with games like the "Nakayama Miho..." one or "...Shin Onigashima". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise, they all seem to start with a dead body being found, and you look for clues, ask questions... 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It seems like there was much more variety and innovation in the U.S. computer Adventure Game genre around the same time. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As it turns out, we do have a very different type of console Adventure Game, later this episode, so I shouldn't really complain too much. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I just don't think these Murder Mystery Games will abate anytime soon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Even Nintendo will jump on that particular bandwagon a little bit later in the year. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Konami Wai Wai World 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 January 14 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Konami begins 1988 with something we'd never quite seen before - a crazy little mash-up of different Konami games, called "Wai Wai World"? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I suppose this is, sort of, an early form of fanservice. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Various Konami characters come together for a non-canonical adventure. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 That's Dr. Cinnamon from 'TwinBee'. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game also features Konami Man. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Dr. Simon just happens to have a female Android who wears bikini. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now really, Dr. Cinnamon! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Come on! We all know what you had in mind when you built Konami Lady. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So Konami Man and Konami Lady, uh, will go out and find various missing heroes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bay door #1 will take you to Dr. Cinnamon, who will heal ya, in between levels. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bay door #3 can't be opened yet. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And door #2 is where you choose your first level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each of the six levels are based on a Konami game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yep! "Wai Wai World" has a very similar layout to "Mega Man" (or so it seems). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You actually can't do levels of just any order. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Certain characters are required to get through -- all the way through certain levels. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll start with a "Castlevania" level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Interestingly, the game that this, sort of, most resembles is "Castlevania". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The levels are laid out much like "Castlevania" levels (horizontal scrolling with lots of staircases). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The goal of each level is to rescue a kidnapped character (Simon Belmont in this case). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The other characters are Mikey from "...Goonies", Ganbare Goemon, King Kong, Fuma from "Getsufu Maden" and a Moai Head (no Solid Snake, I'm afraid). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 You'll occasionally come across that thing, like the flashing box we saw a moment ago. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Can't obtain those sorts of things yet; [only] Goemon can open those particular boxes. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You often have to return to the later levels to get Special Weapons and whatnot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Levels generally have a boss of some sort; that guy is [pretty] easy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you obtain the key, you can rescue the level's hero. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Simon uncharacteristically jumps up and down when you free him. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing about "Wai Wai World": it makes no attempt to integrate the story into the narratives of the various characters (or really make any sense whatsoever). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Nor is there any, sort of, characterization involved. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 No one other than Dr. Cinnamon actually says anything. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Wai Wai World" is really just a standard Action Game, but instead of changing weapons, your entire sprite changes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Dracula, for example, as seen there, is not a boss; he's simply a difficult enemy who appears, here. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If you defeat him, he'll reappear, but Dracula has nothing to do with the game's plot. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing "Wai Wai World" does have is gambling! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Some levels have buildings you can duck into for a quick dice rule or pull of a slot machine handle. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Gambling minigames seem to be becoming, sort of, common in Japanese titles (for example, "Dragon Quest", "Doki Doki Panic" and "Bio Senshi Dan"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This next level is Japanese-themed and you are rescuing Ganbare Goemon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Each character has a different Special Weapon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, I found Simon's cross, up -- up there at the top, underneath his character portrait. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now Goemon has a very short range attack, but is very fast. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Enemies freeze for a sec when you hit 'em. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And 'Goemon's attack is fast enough tjat you can keep hitting them very, very quickly before they unfreeze. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So he's actually very useful. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, by the way, the heart refills that you see actually refill your health in this game, unlike in "Castlevania". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rockets are what refill your Special Weapons. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As I said earlier, the sense of freedom To get one being asked to level is a little deceptive; you can't just start on a level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Certain characters are required to pass certain parts each level. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here is hell, by the way (the level where you find Fuma). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The Pirate Ship is where you find Mikey, and he's small enough to fit in areas other turkers can't reach. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And incidently the cityscape is King Kong's level. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And Easter Island is where you find the Moai head. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's also a Vertical Shoot-'em-Up sequence where you play as TwinBee or Vic Viper. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So the thing about "Wai Wai World": It sounds more fun than it actually is. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The gameplay is [pretty] average. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It's a bit of a shame, since it takes characters from a number of interesting g... -- games and puts them into what's really just a typical Platform-type game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, there are some things I actually sort of, you know, do not like. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, [in] the final level (which is, sort of, like, a Science-Fiction-themed level) there's all these bop -- blob things that attach themselves to you, and then you can't get them off, and they just slowly drain health. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And every single jump, it seems, is spaced so that if you're not right on the very edge of the platform, you won't quite make the next platform. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The graphics are okay, nothing too special. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One cool thing is the way that, om, when you change your characters, the music changes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Here's the Final boss, by the way; he's a little boring. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then we get the "Metroid"-style timer before the base blows up (uh, just like in "Metal Gear", I guess). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was a bit disappointed, but I'm glad Konami is filling its oats, so to speak. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It must have felt confident in gamers' awareness of the Konami brand to even release a game like this. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Oh, by the way, this is a translated version that sort of mangled the, uh, closing credits, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later in 1988, Konami would have a game called "Parodius", which had a very similar idea, but ultimately ended up being a much more successful series. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 SD Gundam World - Gachapon Senshi Scramble Wars 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 January 20 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Human 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Before we get into January, officially, let's cover one last thing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There seems to be some confusion over the release date of this game, "SD Gundam World: Gachapon Senshi Scramble Wars". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The list of F.D.S. games on the Japanese Wikipedia says January 20th 1988. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But another page says November 20th 1987. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And some U.S. sources say November 22nd. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 One explanation seems to be that November was the boxed retail release and January was the FamiCom Disk Reader System release. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Anyway, this is the second Gundam game we've seen - the first 'SD Gundam' game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Probably a lot of you already know this, but Bandai released a whole series of toys, cartoons, comics, and games based on 'SD Gundam' (cute Super-Deformed versions of the 'Gundam' mechs). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Crazy! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first 'Gundam' game was, sort of, Action based affair, but 'SD Gundam' is a turn-based Strategy Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 What!? Seriously? 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The first thing you do is choose one of many scenarios down on the main menu. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 When the game starts, we dig into the map screen and begin playing. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this is the first Strategy-type game on the FamiCom but the genre has been around for quite a while! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 War Games were some of the very first Computer Games released. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, "Empire", uh, has existed in many forms - and this is one of the, uh, sort of, prototypical 'Explore, Build Armies, Conquer Cities, and Fight'-type games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 These sorts of games would later be known as 4X Games. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another such example, this time from 1984, is "Incunabula". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Generally speaking, these games have you moving units around on a map, allocating resources to build more units, and then engaging in turn-based combat with other armies. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Games like this really started blossoming in the mid to late '80s, and then, kind of, took over from, there. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another such title was E.A.'s "Lords of Conquest". 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now this type of game would eventually find its way, uh, to Japan, where it [became] quite popular, for a while. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game that really kicked off this trend in Japan was from Koei and it was called "Romance of The Three Kingdoms", released on the M.S.X. in 1986. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this was the first of a long, long running series of Strategy Games, based around Chinese history. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The object here is to manage your empire and defeat the opposing warlords, in order to unite China. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 We'll see a, uh, of course console ports of this in the near future. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, compared to such games, 'SD Gundam' is [pretty] simple. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Use your D-Pad to select your Gundam dude, then you move him. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It'll tell you how many spaces you have to move this particular guy. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Your first order of business is to, sort of, take over the nearby cities and space stations; this will start some cash rolling in. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can move up to three guys per turn, and then the CPUs turn. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One issue with "SD Gundam": The C.P.U. takes a damn long time to move. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Alright, so the computer is thinking right now. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You, sort of, see all the activity goin' on, in the lower right-hand side, there. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It'll take a moment to calculate this move. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, once it's done thinking, it'll take the cursor to the unit it wants to move and then move it... and it'll start thinking again, and so on. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And this seriously slows down the game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Uh... For those of you used to playing "Civilization" or [something] like that (kind of, you know, everything, kind of, shoots by at quick speed), you'll really be banging your head against the wall, waiting for the computer to move. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, at some point you'll come into a conflict with the enemy and battle will ensue. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But rather than, sort of, like, in the usual, you know, random damage inflicted by most such games, you actually need to fight it out in Action scenes. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Yes, you see your little robots run around shooting each other, until someone's Health Bar is depleted. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You both have laser guns and a lightsaber-like melee weapon. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately, these sequences are not very well executed and tend to add a bit of length to the game. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Another important feature: You need to build more mechs. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Because I defeated the Computer's robot, I was able to take over that particular Space Station. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Once you've got money coming in, you'll need to start building more Gundams. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather, they're produced from these giant Gachapon machines. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Gachapons are capsule toys, which come out of vending machines (quite popular in Japan). 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are tons of automated video game inspired gachapon toys available. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, despite some issues, "SD Gundam" is not really a bad game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Bandai's two main developers were Tose and Human. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 They went for Human for this one, which is probably a good idea. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, while there... were far better, sort of, Military, uh, turn-based Strategy Games released on consoles, in the near future ("Military Madness" for the TurboGrafx [comes] to mind), this is really not a bad start to the wave of FamiCom Strategy Games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ice Hockey 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 January 21 🇯🇵 // 1988 March [?] 🇺🇸 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Nintendo | Pax Softnica 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Despite a decrease in the quantity and quality of F.D.S. games, Nintendo is still continuing to support the system. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here's the next in Nintendo's long line of F.D.S. Sports Games (and one that Western gamers will probably remember quite fondly), "Ice Hockey". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 They decided to change up the selection screen a bit, this time; it's not exactly the same screen as found in "Volleyball". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Now, if you played this game, you know its stroke of genius. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Rather than getting you a team of identical players (like [pretty] much every other Sports Game, up until now) there are three distinct types - Lanky, Fatso, and Peewee. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You can choose any combination of types you want. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I've gone with two Fatsos, one Lanky, and one Peewee. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 The concept almost seems borrowed from "Doki Doki Panic" (a.k.a. "Super Mario Bros. 2") the way each character has a different combination of speed and strength. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, Fatso is the strong but slow guy, Lanky is the fast but weak guy and Peewee is the regular guy. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Fatsos are best for scoring goals, since their shot's [pretty] fast, and they can usually knock over the other two types. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And here, by the way, is the U.S. version, which was released [pretty] quickly after the Japanese disk, with some minor changes, such as the teams. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Ice Hockey" was co-developed by Nintendo and Pax Softnica. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And it's really sorta what 8-bit Sports Games should be like - fast, fun, and doesn't really try too hard to recreate the actual sport of Hockey. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 There's really not too much to say about this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The game sorta speaks for itself, I think. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 But I will make it a little announcement. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 After this, Nintendo seems to go through, sort of, a dry spell as a developer! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 The last couple years we saw "Super Mario Bros.", two '...Zelda' games, "Metroid", "Kid Icarus", "Punch-Out", and a few others. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, over the next couple years, there's [only] gonna be one major Nintendo-developed game that Western gamers are gonna be familiar with. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And that game is huge! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But... other than that, Nintendo is going to focus on the Japanese market. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As for its U.S. games, Nintendo mostly decides to turn to outside developers! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 So, expect the number of familiar games from Nintendo to slow to a trickle, after this one. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sukeban Deka III 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 January 22 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bear's 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toei 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 As far as kusoge-type games go, "Superman" was [pretty] bad, but it is an absolute masterpiece compared to "Sukeban Deka III", from the unstoppable team of Toei and Shouei System (a.k.a. Bears - the same guys who brought you "Hokuto no Ken"). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Does this superband deca sound familiar? 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, it should. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was a long-running T.V. show involving High School girls fighting crime, usually with a special weaponized yo-yo. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 "Chronsega Episode Three" featured "Sukeban Deka II" - a game based on the second T.V. show. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Not a good game, but much worse is "Sukeban Deka III", based on the third run of the T.V. show. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 I guess they had to switch out the cast members on a regular basis when they got a little too old. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 So this game is about as good as the first "Hokuto no Ken" game - meaning that it's terrible. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 If ya die, you start the whole level all over again with a different girl. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 There are three main characters, each with their own weapon. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 After a while of battling cheerleaders (or whoever the... -- these enemies are supposed to be), your character will get stuck for about one second, and then ninjas start coming out (or something). 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Really, there's no reason to play this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Later on, there are some side-scrolling sequences in caves and whatnot. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 But, uh, I don't think [we] need to pursue this any further. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ripple Island 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1988 January 23 🇯🇵 
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tokai Engineering 
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing I do like about this game is the music. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Surprisingly good intro music from Sunsoft - a company which, so far, has been releasing mostly crap. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, we use the name Tokai engineering in the credits, who were involved in some of Sunsoft's better games. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Certainly "Ripple Island" is much slicker than "Nazoler Land". 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 I was just lamenting the fact that so many Japanese Adventure Games are based on the same old Murder Mystery genre. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And then along comes this game! 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Granted, the plot is not exactly fresh (a Princess has been kidnapped) but hey! "Ripple Island"'s charming little fairy book setting is a serious change of scenery. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 And there's a lot of cute animals in this game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It frequently seems these animals are blocking your path or something and need to go fetch a barrier (something like that) to get 'em to move. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 From what it appears, the inhabitants of "Ripple Island" are small people - about the same size as the animals. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 One thing: The name "Ripple Island" does make sense, but for some reason this name is often transliterated as a 'Lipple Island' which is rather silly sounding. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 And, I suppose if you quickly glance at the title a list of games, you might think it reads 'Nipple Island', which would more likely be a game for the P.C.-88. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, here we go. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For example, this badger is standing, blocking your way. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Gameplay-wise "Ripple Island" is really nothing new. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 You've, sort of, got your standard Adventure Game icons there - 'Move', 'Look', 'Talk', 'Pick up', 'Inventory', 'Push and Pull', [and] so on. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 This game has been mocked for being, sort of, baffling-looking and involving kind of scenes where you simply wander around in the grass a lot, looking for something, but I'd say it's actually a [pretty] decent Adventure Game. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 It was popular enough to at least get a cell phone remake, recently. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Eventually you'll make your way to the castle and meet the King, who will sorta lay out some of the plot details to you. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 For some reason, almost all these Japanese games, at some point, have you talkin' to a King. 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 Well, anyway, the really important thing here, I suppose, is that we finally appear to be getting something of decent quality from Sunsoft. 🍇

🤖🍪🍊🍓 Maybe there's hope for these guys next! 🍇🍌


🤖🍪🍊🍓 In fact, a little bit later in this year, we're gonna be seeing perhaps... the first really, sort of, great Sunsoft games that we all know about, namely "Master Blaster". 🍇🍌
