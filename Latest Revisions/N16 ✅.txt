👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 16 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 And *finally*, we are *back* with the long, long, long overdue "...Episode 16" of '*Chrontendo*'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sorry, we were away [for] so *long*, [but] sometimes these things [just] happen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It'll never happen again, I promise. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 At *any* [rate], once again, we have another 15 games [for] the *FamiCom*, [released mostly] in March *1987*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, [not] all is [sweetness and light] this episode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, we're moving through an unusually grim patch this time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'll] even be so bold [as to] say that March 27th is perhaps *the* worst day [for] the FamiCom we've seen *so* far, with *four* really horrible re... -- games being *released* all at *once*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In [fact], this whole *episode* [is loaded with crappy games]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But], it's okay because we've [got some] good games [as] well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, [before] we [get into] all [that, *we're* just] gonna [step] back for a sec [and] do, [sort of, a little] wrap up of the *world* of video games [at] this [particular point in] time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [What] follows is [just] a [little summary] of *what's* been goin' on [from around 1984 to 1987]. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌟 World of Video Games at this Point in Time Round-Up ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Since* 1986, was such [an important] year [for] the *FamiCom*, I'd [*like* to] step back a [bit and] take a look [at] the bigger [picture] of video gaming [*around*] this time *in* the mid-*1980s*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Then*, as now, there were *three* major places you [could] *play* [video] games: on *consoles*, in *arcades*, and on *home* computers. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# The Personal Computer in the U.S. 1985 - 1987 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 After the Video Game Crash of 1983 [to 1984], personal [computers] became *the* primary platform [for playing *video*] games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The Commodore 64 was the [biggest] selling home [computer] in the *U.S.* (and, I believe, the *world*) but *Apple*, [I.B.M., and] *Atari all* had *some* success [with] their own [computers]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Starting in] the [late] 1970s, *small Computer* Game companies began [springing] up (especially [in] *California*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*And*] by the mid-1980s, [many were releasing] games [that] were selling [hundreds] of [thousands] of *copies*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The main advantage over *console* games was the *format*: cheap [and] readily [available] *floppy* disks, as [opposed to] the more [expensive and difficult to] make [*cartridges*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Literally] *anyone* [could produce] a [*Computer*] Game, and during the [1980s thousands] of [titles] were [released for] P.C.s. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some [of] these companies [we're] already *familiar with*, [such as] *Brøderbund*, who [released] some huge hits like "Lode Runner", 'Prince of Persia', [and] "*MYST*" in the early '80s [and the] early *'90s*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 E.A. was a U.S. software publisher, that [had] become *hugely* [successful with] its R.P.G.s, such [as] 'Bard's Tale', and innovative [titles] like "*M.U.L.E.*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They were known [at] the *time* for their deluxe packaging, uh, *game* boxes [that looked], sorta, like *L.P.* covers, [and] promoting the actual game designers' names. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In [*1987*], they would release their, uh, first internally [*developed*] game, "[Skate or] *Die*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And in 1990, they would begin publishing games for home consoles, eventually becoming one [of] the *biggest* and [somewhat] *controversial* [video] game [publishers in] the *world*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Meanwhile, Sierra* Entertainment (another California-[based] Computer Game giant) had been [releasing] a series of very [popular Graphical *Adventure*] Games such as the 'King's [Quest]' series, "*Space* Quest", and (starting in 1987) 'Leisure [Suit] Larry'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ironically], they [*also*] achieved a *huge* [hit with] a [port], uh, of a *Japanese* [Computer] Game, "*Thexder*", [which had] previously [been released to the] *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] they [*dominated*] the [Adventure] Game market [until] the arrival of *LucasArts* in 1987. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Some* P.C. game companies were more known [for] *Action* [titles], such [as] Epyx with their "[Jumpman]" and '[Impossible] *Mission*' games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *They* [would] go [out of] business [before] *too* long, [but not before releasing] their [endlessly] ported "Winter Games", "Summer Games" [and] 'California Games' series. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Still active were *older* companies such [as] *Activision, [as] well* [as] the Activision *spin-off* company *Accolade*, the infamous Accolade spin-off company *Acclaim* (which [would be] founded [in *1987*]) and *another* Activision spin-off, *Absolute*, (which [was] formed in [*1986*]). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *In* the *U.K.* (where such computers as the Z.X. Spectrum [and] the Amstrad C.P.C. [dominated the video] game field) *several* [British video] game [developers started] up such [as] CodeMasters, *Ocean* Software (known [for] their T.V. [and] movie, tie-in games"), U.S. Gold, [and], of course, *Rareware*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Most* of] these companies *would* eventually release titles *for* the U.S. [console *market*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In [*1986*], a French Computer Game [publisher], *Ubisoft*, [opened] its [doors, and] *another* French company, *Infogrames*, began achieving *some* success. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Infogrames would *eventually* become [an] industry *giant*, buying [*countless*] other *smaller* companies [and eventually acquiring] the name [and intellectual] property of Atari themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The thing [about] *all* these companies is while they *began* making games *for* personal computers (which [at] the time were *usually* very much [*different* than] Arcade Games [or] *console* games) the [success of] Nintendo [started] a *chain* of *events* resulting in them becoming major players in the western console *market*. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# The Personal Computer in Japan 1985 - 1987 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 In *Japan*, the *computer* scene [and] the home *console* scene were *much* more closely *linked*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 A *number* [of computer] systems *had* entered the [*market*] by [the mid-'80s] (the P.C.-[88, the] FM-7, [but *most successfully*], the M.S.X.). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The M.S.X. was [not] a computer *manufacturer*, [but] *rather* a [computer] *standard* [introduced] by *Microsoft* [of] all people. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [it was perhaps] equivalent to the se... -- say the P.C. standard [which dominates] the market [*today*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Many big *electronics* companies [produced] M.S.X. *computers*: Toshiba, Sony, Samsung, Philips, Yamaha, [and] *so* on. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There *was [quite] a* [bit of] *crossover* between M.S.X. [*and*] the FamiCom - [with] many [publishers {and} developers releasing titles for] *both* ([for example], Konami, Hudson, Square, Enix, [*and] others*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Around*] this time, we see many Japanese [*Computer*] Game companies jumping on board [*with*] Nintendo [*and* releasing] games [*for*] the FamiCom *or* the F.D.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In [*1986*], the [M.S.X.] *2* was [released], which had improved gaming [capabilities]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the most *famous* M.S.X. game was "Metal Gear", [released in *1987*] by *Konami* [and *ported*] a [little bit later to] the [FamiCom]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [*throughout*] the mid-1980s, the M.S.X. remained Nintendo's *prime* [competitor] in the [video game field]. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Video Games in the Arcades 1985 - 1987 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 While *Arcade* Games [weren't *quite*] the phenomenon [that] they were [in] the *early '80s*, [they] were still a major [part of] the [video] game *industry*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The years [1985] through [1987] saw [*quite a] revolution* in *Arcade* Games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Older game manufacturers [released] newer [and] improved *hardware* [such as] Sega's System *16* board or the Namco System 1 [and] *2*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Meanwhile], younger* companies such [as] Capcom, [and] *S.N.K.* [had] emerged [to challenge the] older *giants*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *Racing* Games, the old top-*down* view was slowly being phased out in favor of the [first]-*person* view [with] the emergence of more convincing 3D *effects* in games like "Konami GT" or Sega's "Hang-On" [and] "*OutRun*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Shoot*]-'em-Ups (one [of] the longest-*lived* Arcade genres) [got] a new lease on life [with] such [innovative titles as] "Gradius", Capcom's "1941..." [and] "1942", "...Side Arms", [and] [1987's] "*R*-[Type]" from *Irem* [and] "Twin *Cobra*" [from] *Toaplan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Taito*] continued {to} develop more old-school style *games* with hits like "Arkanoid" [and] "Bubble *Bobble*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And *Atari* [brought] four player Action into arcades in a big way with "[*Gauntlet*]". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Emerging* genres were [beginning to *develop*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For [example], the [*Beat*]-'em-Up with Technos' "*Renegade*" [and] "Double *Dragon*" [from 1986 and *1987*, respectively]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Run*-'n'-Gun first [got its] start with "*Commando*" in [*1985* and was] *fully [formed]* by the [release] of Konami's "*Contra*" [in *1987*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The one [on] one [*Fighter*] was slowly making some *progress* with Capcom's [first "*Street Fighter]" game coming [out in 1987 as] *well*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the side-scrolling [*Platformer] continued* [to] make its presence known [with] Sega's 'Wonder Boy' games [and] "Shinobi" as well [as] Capcom [releases like "Ghosts] 'n Goblins" [and 1987's] "Bionic Comman... -- *Commando*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Most [of] the big Arcade *hits would* be [ported] to the FamiCom, *or* [Nintendo Entertainment] *System*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *Arcade* hardware [had *advanced*] {to} the [point] where a *four* year old *system like the [FamiCom]* could [not accurately reproduce] Arcade *Games*. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Video Games Consoles 1985 - 1987 ✨


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [1986] saw the FamiCom's focus change [from] Arcade ports *to* original [*titles*], [with both] established Arcade *companies* [and] newer publishers [developing titles] especially [for] the *FamiCom*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [We] will continue [to] *see* Arcade ports, ports of Japanese Computer Games, [and] even the odd *U.S.* [computer port] account for a [*pretty*] good percentage of [releases], however. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But *undoubtedly*] the [biggest development] *for* the FamiCom is the success of the N.E.S. in the [United] *States*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Test [marketed] in [New] York *City* in [late] *1985*, the system was [released] nationwide in [*1986*, and] was [a] substantial hit, becoming a must-have [Christmas item and] *selling* [about] a million copies [that] *year*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One big [landmark] in [*1987*] was more *games*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As ya [might] recall, *Nintendo launched* the system with 18 [*titles*] (*two* [of] which were [licensed from] *Irem*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Throughout *1986*, Nintendo released] seven *more* [titles, (mostly] back catalogue games, like "Donkey Kong 3" [and] "*Popeye*"). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But *fall* of '86 saw the first [handful of titles from] third-party publishers (namely Bandai, [Data] East, [and] *Capcom*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Still* by the year's end the [Nintendo Entertainment] System [had] *barely* over 30 games [*available*] (*many* of which [had] been [out in] *Japan* [for] a couple {of} *years*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*1987*] saw the [number] of games increased [to almost] *100* with many more publishers releasing [*titles*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Konami was quick to release "Gradius", "Track & Field", and "Rush'n' Attack", and even "*Castlevania*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Data East* [released] a couple more titles, uh, in mid year of 1987. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 S.N.K. released "Ikari *Warriors*" in May. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Tecmo*] debuted with "*Rygar*" in July, and [*Taito*] with "Elevator Action", "...Legend of Kage", [and] "Arkanoid" in *August*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Nintendo released a few *additional* titles in *March* before [finally bringing out] the *big guns*: "...*Zelda*" in July [and] "*Metroid*" [and] "Kid *Icarus*" in *August*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "...Zelda" was a huge *hit* in the U.S. [and] established the FamiCom as (even more firmly) the number one *console*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *[second] half* of 1987, uh, saw the N.E.S. debuts from Sunsoft, Irem, and F.C.I.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Major players *missing* were *Hudson*, *Jaleco*, [and most] famously Namco (who wouldn't release an N.E.S. [title] *themselves* [until] the very end [of] the system's lifespan). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Finally*, late 1987 saw a few non-Japanese companies release their first games for the Nintendo: Brøderbund, Rare, Activision, Atari (under their Tengen imprint). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And unfortunately, [1987] sees the birth of U.S.-based low *quality* publishers such as Acclaim and L.J.N.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The sudden popularity of video game consoles caused a few [of] the companies [to] throw their [hat into] the *ring, even* though *Nintendo* still ended up [with about 90% of] the *market*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There are several *now-forgotten consoles* (such as the Tomy Pyuuta Jr., or the Gakken Compact *Vision*) but [only] *two* companies had any success at all: *Atari* [and] *Sega*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *Atari* [2600] was *technically* [still] *around* with a few new releases trickling [*out*, if] you [can believe] *that*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [in] June [1986] Atari dusted off a never-[released] system from [*1984* and put it] on the [market] as the Atari [*7800*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, the lack of third-[party *support*] helped kill [the] *system*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, simply put, the 7800 mostly [featured ports] of [already available] *games* [and] didn't [really] have any *killer app* type titles [such as] "[Super] *Mario* Bros.". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Sega*, released the S.G. [1000] Mark III in *Japan* in [*1985* and] had a redesigned version on the U.S. [market] by Christmas [of *1986*] as the Sega *Master System* (*presumably* to [compete] with the ...int... -- Nintendo's N.E.S.). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] *technically [superior* to] the N.E.S., the *Master* [System] never [really] took *off* in the U.S. *or* Japan. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was due to, once again, the fact that the third-party developers were locked into [restrictive] *contracts* with *Nintendo*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] a lack of a system selling game, poor marketing, and it was *probably* in the *U.S.* the worst game packaging for ady -- any video game console *ever*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 '*Chrontendo*' [has] *now* launched a *new* series, '*Chronsega*', which will *play* through the releases *for* the Master System. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The first [two] *episodes* covering [*1985*] through early [*1987*] are [already available]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, [1987 begins with] Nintendo [continuing to] dominate the *Japanese* market, as well as reinvigorating the console scene in the [United] States as *well*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, *some* change was [definitely] in the air. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hudson Soft, who'd [been releasing] a [lot] of games *for* the FamiCom, was [developing] a [brand] new video game chip system, the C 62. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This chip was [*superior* to] the ones [found inside] the FamiCom, *or* the Sega *Master* System [and] would help usher in a new era of home video games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But *that* is] a story *for* another time. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Law of the West 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 06 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Accolade
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *This* episode of 'Chrontendo' is, [sort of], a *weird* one, so it's [fitting that] we [start with, sort] of, a *weird game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Pony Canyon's "Law of the *West*" is a [port] of the 1985 Commodore *64* game, *originally* [developed] by Accolade. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Not much has been *changed* other [than] the dialogue being translated [into] *Japanese*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Law of the West" could *probably* be classified as a Text Adventure Game with animated illustrations at the top. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You play the game by [selecting] one of [several] responses to each question [asked]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Certain *responses* will give you *positive* results and others will give you *negative* results. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 After the character walks *away*, your score is tallied up. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *other* than just selecting answers [to] *questions*, there *is* a *little* [bit] of gameplay involved. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If [you] move the [selection], uh, *all* the way up to the *top*, you'll draw [your] gun [and] then you [can] use the D-Pad [to] move [around the] *gun* sight. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once a *level*, some dude dressed up like Tom *Wolfe* appears in the background [and] you [can shoot him for] bonus points. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There are a few other things in the game [as] well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If your conversation with a doctor goes well (like [it] has *here*) he'll *heal* you [if ya get] *shot*, rather [than] the game simply ending when a character guns [you] *down*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And *incidentally*], if [your] conversation goes *really* bad, some characters will [shoot] you - and if you are feeling [sort] of *ruthless*, you [can] simply gun them down as *well*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *By* a strange [little] coincidence "*Law* [of] the West", [*sort] of*, resembles Kemco's "...*Time* Stranger" released [late 1986 and] coupled -- *covered* a couple episodes ago. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Both were, [sort] of, [dialogue]-based *Adventure* Games, *though*, of course, the [original version of] "Law [of] the West" definitely predates the *Kemco* game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There I've just, uh, [shot] down the character instead of conversing with *him*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the original Commodore 64 game *has* its *fans* [and it's *probably*] the -- [that] version [to] *try*, as, uh, [most of] the games entertainment value *comes from* the sometimes rather amusing dialogue. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, [as] you [can] see, [I've actually] been *shot* by picking the wrong responses [for that particular] *character*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I *guess* in a *strange* way, though, "*Law* [of] the West" *does*, [sort of], act as a distant ancestor to the [countless] Japanese, uh, Visual Novel-type games (where basically you have an [animated] sequence, [and] then you choose dialogue options, [and] then, [sort] of, move forward [*that*] way). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Quite*] a *few* of these things were released over the years, uh, *in Japan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In [*1987*], however, "Law [of] the West" was a [bit] of [an] oddity. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Tobidase Daisakusen 🇯🇵 // 3D Worldrunner 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 12 🇯🇵 // 1987 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Square
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by DOG 🇯🇵 // Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On the *F.D.S.*, it's another [release] from *D.O.G.*, which (as you [might] *recall*) is [an imprint from] *Square* - which was [created specifically to release] *F.D.S.* games [developed] *by* Square [and] other [independent] developers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the third D.O.G. game *released*: "Tobidase Daisakusen" ('Daisakusen' meaning 'Big Battle'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Most] *notably*, the [*creative*] team [*behind*] this game is Hironobu *Sakaguchi*, [Nobuo] *Uematsu*, [and] programmer [Nasir] Gebelli. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These guys [would *later*] go on [to] make "Rad *Racer*" [and] 'Final [Fantasy]' - *games* which I *believe* were perhaps [slightly] more [successful than] *this* one. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once ya [get past] the various loading screens [and introductions and] the game *proper* [actually] *starts*, you [will] see [that] "Tobidase Daisakusen" *is*... a [pretty] [blatant] *rip-off* of Sega's "*Space* Harrier." 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Space *Harrier*" was [released to] arcades in [*1985* and] was [one of] the [earliest] games to convincingly simulate 3D, using Sega's Super Scaler *technology*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 While Square's game [doesn't] look nearly as nice [as] "Space *Harrier*", it's [*pretty] impressive* from a *technical* standpoint. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Several FamiCom *games* ([most notably], uh, *Racing* Games) did employ some pseudo-3D [*effects*, but] there was nothing [out] there [at] the time [that did] {it} *quite* [as] well [as] *this* game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *actual* gameplay is a [little different than] "Space Harrier". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your character [can't] *fly* ([only] jump), and *infrequently* acquire some [sort] of weapon. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] also power-ups hidden in the *columns* [that sometimes] *appear*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One of them is a *mushroom*, which (unlike "[Super] *Mario* Bros.") [will] actually, uh, *kill* you if you [get it]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [However], *some* parts, uh, such [as], the, uh, end of level bosses here are *ripped* off *[pretty]* much [directly from] "*Space* Harrier". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As ya [might recall, that] game [also] featured a boss [that] was, [sort] of, a *dragon* made [out] of *several* sprites connected [together]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *This game* [actually got] a *[pretty] quick* release on the American *N.E.S.*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Later in 1987 it got] a U.S. release by *Acclaim* as "3D *WorldRunner*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game certainly shows off the *power* of the Nintendo Entertainment *System*, uh, [but] I *really* wish [that] more thought [and originality] was put [into] the game *itself*, rather than [just] into the [*technical* aspects]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Though*, [if] nothing else, "Tobidase Daisakusen" is [definitely a] step in the [right] direction [for] Square. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 City Adventure Touch: Mystery of Triangle 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 14 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Compile
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toho 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, our big [disappointment] *this episode* is "City [Adventure] *Touch*: Mystery of *Triangle*", which (as the credits *note*) was [developed] by *Compile*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Compile* is [*noted*] for some high-[quality] *releases* for companies [that] usually [don't *produce*] high-[quality] *releases* *so I had* [somewhat] high expectations going *in*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As [it] turns [*out*], this game is *based on* (surprise, surprise!) a popular *manga* series by Mitsuru Adachi, which was *also* made into an *anime* [around] this time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 '*Touch*' was, [sort] of, a teenage soap opera [comic] based around High School *Baseball*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you're thinking, 'Hey, this sounds like [kind] of a weird idea for a *FamiCom* game,' well, I *guess* you [are in agreement] with the *makers* of the "...Touch..." *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Because [*what] this* actually is is an Action-Adventure proto [*Beat*]-'em-Up, which *really* has nothing [to] do [with] the original [comic] book *series*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *main characters* [of] the *comic*, Kazuya, Tetsuya, and *Manami*, *stroll* [around] town [fighting] these [little *elves* as] well as robots, tiny tanks, [and] so on, [and] *so* forth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] enter shops [and] buy some basic [*items*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, [at] some point, you [can] even, [sort] of, power-up [sort of] where you [can] throw *baseballs* as opposed [to just] *punching* everything. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *The game* seems [to] resemble Konami's earlier "Ganbare *Goemon*!..." game, though [it *really* doesn't] seem [to] make any *sense*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, the [comic book] was a more [or] less [realistic] (or [realistic] in terms of, you know, Japanese soap opera, *comic* books) look at *high* schoolers, so the *weird*, [sort] of, uh, Science-Fiction bizarre elements [don't] really seem [to] make any *sense* [in] the context of [what] this is *about*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [*actually*] control *two* characters [at] once (the twin *brothers*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They move in *unison* [and] punch [at] the same *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] see, they have Health Bars there, up in the upper right [and] upper left *corner*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] *really* a [bit of] a shame [that] Compile developed [such an] inferior [title] in *this*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *seems* [to] be [mocked in] Japan for having no relation [to] the original *comic* series. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] *normally* Compile's work is very good *technically* speaking, *this game really not so much* so. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's [*quite*] a [bit] of sprite flicker on this thing [from] time to *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, in the [*past*] Compile have been able [to do] games like "*Zanac*", which had *tons* of sprites [and] almost no flicker [at] all. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "City Adventure Touch..." was actually [published] by *Toho* - the major Japanese movie [and] *T.V.* studio. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the *U.S.*, they're known primarily for their Godzilla movies [as] well as other [giant] *monster* movies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *in* Japan, they're a mainstream media *company* [that] makes all *kinds* of movies - as well [as] other things like anime series. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I believe they [actually] made the '*Touch*' anime series, which is why they [put out this] *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] for their [first] FamiCom game, they [were definitely not] off to a good start. 🍇🍌

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 17 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?]
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Victor Musical Industries 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Pay attention [to] this opening *scene* here because this is the best part [of] the whole *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, these guys [are] awesome. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Yes*, this is "Hana no Star *Kaidou*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this is a another horrible, horrible *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though ya *really* have to [admire] anyone who can walk [around] wearing hot pink *shoes* like that. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, this is courtesy of *Victor* (the music *company*) and developed by... Lord knows who (I'm sure they [don't] wanna take *credit* [on] this). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *in this game*, you play these two musicians who... well... jump around over, uh, motorcyclists [and] other *people* - in [front] of what appear [to] be *McDonald's*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, there's [some] basic *platforming*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 They are attacked by, uh, *enemies* (which *mostly* seem to be [just, sort] of, regular *people*), uh, which they [can eliminate] by firing [little] musical *notes* at [them]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [*will* admit] the, uh, animation [of them] firing musical notes is [kind] of awesome; suddenly they whip [out] of nowhere like [little] microphone stand [or] something [like] that. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 {I} believe the [*plot*] of this game is that you [are] traveling across Japan, uh, gaining musical *stardom* and eliminating I guess any, [sort] of, a person, fan, or other musician who happens to cross [your] path. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is [an] interesting [and] weird premise for a *game*, [but] the *game itself* is [*pretty*] much [utterly] *worthless*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] this is a another fine example of [what the] Japanese would call [kusoge] (meaning 'a shitty game'). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, *grabbing* the little electric guitar there [will] make you temporarily *invincible*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Among other things, you [collect] Gold records [and] so on, [and] so forth. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Altogether, there are *six levels*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess you [just, sort] of, run [around] Japan to various Japanese areas. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Here we start [in] Harajuku.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you *actually* end up in New [York] *City* (which I guess is, [sort] of, every Japanese pop band's ultimate goal). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Perhaps the most [interesting] thing about this game is the [fact that] you [can control] how close the characters are. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ([Just like in] the Mickey Mouse game from *Hudson*, these, [sort] of, move [together and] have [to] *jump* [together]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Pressing Up [and] Down on the D-Pad [will] make them move further [apart] or closer [apart]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Most of] the challenge in [later] games is, [sort] of, doing all this weird platforming [with] these *two* guys [at] *once*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Other [than that], though, this is [for] the [most part], a [completely] worthless game. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Goonies 2: Fratelll Salgo no Chousen 🇯🇵 // Goonies II 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 18 🇯🇵 // 1987 November [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our first *big* game this episode is from *Konami* (surprise, *surprise*!). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's "...*Goonies II*: Fratelli [Saigo no] *Chousen*" a sequel to [Konami's 1986] *FamiCom* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[And] (like* a lot [of] Konami games) "...Goonies II..." is a quality made [*title*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Look* [at] this very nice animated *intro, here*, as Ma Fratelli explains the *plot* [to] you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This sequel is much *longer* than the original "...Goonies" *game*, so it *does* allow {you} the option of *continuing*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "The Goonies" was, of course, the much [loved] 1985 *movie concerning the* adventures of a gang of ragtag kids [and] their run-ins with a criminal family known [as] the *Fratellis*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Naturally, [pirate] treasure was *involved*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *story* of the *first* "...Goonies" game, [*sort] of*, resembled [*that*] of the *movie*, but "...*Goonies II*..." takes off in a completely off-the-wall direction (I guess, well, [sort] of, like Konami's "King Kong *II*" game). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here* you're [rescuing] the other '*Goonies*' who've [been] captured by the [*Fratellis*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *But also* there's Annie the *mermaid*, Eskimos, underwater SCUBA diving sequences, little old wizard guys who live underground - *all kinds* of things [completely unrelated to] the film. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "...Goonies II..." is a [mostly] side-scrolling [Platformer like the *first] game*, *but with* a catch. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There *are* these first-person Adventure Game like sequences added in when you enter a *door*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this room, I [found] the *keys* [necessary] to open safes [and] *jail doors*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You'll [need to collect] a [*lot* of] these [kind] of things in the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Other [items] you'll need [to collect]: a hammer ([for] smacking on walls), various sorts of *shoes*, other weapons (such as the [slingshot] or the *boomerang*), special glasses, SCUBA [gear] (for going [underwater]), special kinds of armor. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 All sorts of, uh, silly [little] things appear [in] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] use the hammer to -- (uh, as I mentioned) [to] look for *hidden things* [in] the walls. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the [*game*] starts off in the, uh, Fratellis' -- I believe this -- well, I *believe* [this is] actually their, uh, *basement* [I'm] going into, [right] *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... [This is] *much* [like] the [*first*] "...Goonies" game, [but] this sequel is much bigger (so *much* so [that ya actually need an] in-game *map*, seen *here*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Notice it's labeled '*Front*'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... *Going* through the *doors* [will] connect you to the back section of the game, (which *effectively doubles* the size of "...Goonies II"). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Altogether (uh, front [and] back), I *believe* there's around [150] rooms, (not [counting] the various, uh, [first]-*person* rooms). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In order [to get] *around*, you'll frequently [need to be, sort] of, *moving* back [and] *forth* [between] the front [and] the back [sections]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] of course, there are tons of *hidden* rooms, passages, items, - *all* kinds of things [that] you'll have [to] find. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And not to] mention [the] simple [fact that finding your] way [*around*] the "...Goonies II..." world *can [be pretty] tricky*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I} [just] found a *magic locator* device. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *as you* [can] gather from the video, the *platforming* [and] the [*fighting*] in "...Goonies..." is *really* [not that] difficult. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This] is [*definitely] not* "Mega Man". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Ah! See here [I'm] -- now [I'm] in the -- the *'Back'* section.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is again in the, uh, Fratellis' [*hideout*, but] notice it's a [slightly different] *color*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], *here [I've* actually] found one of the jailed 'Goonies'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You] need the keys [to get him] out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You need to collect all six [and] then, of course, rescue your friend, Annie the mermaid (*who*, of course, was [not] in the movie *[at] all*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "...*Goonies*..." is [not really like] a "Mega Man"-style Platformer; [it's] *more*, [sort] of, one of those, you know, 'What the hell do I do *now*?' kind of games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's [*completely*] non-lin... -- *linear* [and] you *really* have [to, sort] of, walk {all} *over* the place looking [for] random [*items*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You have these, [sort] of, "...Zelda"-like [*hermit*] folks who live [in] the rooms who give you *hints* (well, they're, [sort] of, hints I suppose). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Sometimes they [send] you on {a} [little] fetch quest to, uh, look [for *items*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [if] you were [to] play "...Goonies (I)" [and] "...II" back [to] back, you'd *see* the way [that] games, uh, were [starting to] change [between] early [1986 and 1987]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah. Here we come to the [ubiquitous] (well, [not *quite* yet ubiquitous]) ice *level* last seen [in] Konami's "Esper *Dream*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But [*around*] this time, the influence of "...Zelda" [and] "Metroid" are, uh, *becoming* [pretty] obvious [in] games like this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Whereas] "...Goonies (I)" was [pretty] *linear*, um, ([albeit] with *some* [exploration involved]) "...Goonies II..." is all [about] finding hidden [items that will] allow you to access [otherwise] inaccessible areas ([like] the SCUBA diving suit, sue -- shoes that allow ya [to] jump higher, {and} so on). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... These [are] all *found* (as I mentioned) in the [first]-person *sections*, and (like I said) you often have [to] use the *hammer* [to] smash a *hole* and [find] the hidden door. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There are, of course, the little "...Zelda"-esque like *men* found, uh, in these *rooms*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, th... -- *all* this [just, sort of], shows [that] Konami's sort of *continuing [to] move in the direction that [it] *had* been going [with] games [like] "King Kong" ([sort] of, uh, more non-linear *exploration*-type games). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This [particular] door is a [*little*] tricky [to get] *into*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You] actually have to [land on] the [platform], then very [quickly get] in. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Never [quite]* sure what the story was on the red rooms. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Are the doors *rusty* or covered [in] *blood*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And again, hit everything [and] look for a hidden room or door. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *here's* [the] thing about "...Goonies II". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... "...Goonies (I)", as we might *recall*, was never released in the U.S. *except* in arcades. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, *here's* one [of] the more [interesting] parts in the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the bridge [you] have [to] cross, *uh, those [little]* metal skull things [will] actually steal your boomerang if they [hit] you, [so they're *quite*] annoying. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *as* [I] was saying, uh, "...*Goonies* II", *was* one [of] the first Konami games [to] come out for the N.E.S. *in* the [United] States. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] was [actually released] in [late *1987*], so [it] *really* came [out *only*] a couple months after "Metroid" *itself*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This means that "...Goonies II..." was *one* of the *[first]*, [sort] of, non-linear Adventure-style [Platformers] *seen* over here [in] the U.S.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *because of this*, I think, it's *actually* received, uh, [quite] a following over the years. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, *playing* the game *now*, I [*can't*] really say [that it] works [*completely*] all [that] well. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... [For] example, there *really* isn't... 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, here's an appearance of, uh, *Konami* Man [right] *here* (naturally). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Make sure ya [don't *hit] him* or he won't fill up your Energy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There -- [But] there *really* isn't a *whole* [lot] of *variety* in the, uh... -- the *levels*; [and] the [overall] level [design isn't] nearly [as] cool [as] say, uh, "Metroid" [or] "*Castlevania*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 On a *purely visual* level, "...*Goonies* II..." is *actually* kinda *boring*, uh, with a *few exceptions*, such as the *bridge*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Many* [of the rooms are almost *identical*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There's, sort of, the same old [basements and] caves, ya know, with a *few* other things thrown in as *well*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [The *enemies* don't really] do much [except] walk back [and] *forth*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the [first]-*person* sections (while always *short) tend* [to] be *annoying*, [and] *mostly* involve [hitting] every single wall [in] the room looking [for] hidden *doors*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the *interface* during these sections is rather *clunky*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [*don't* get] me wrong "...*Goonies* II..." *is* one [of the better] *games* [this] episode and [it] *is*, ya know, one [of] the usual high-[quality] *products* [from] *Konami*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And it's *actually* quite] *innovative* in its own *way*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [just don't] think everything works [quite] [as] well [as it] *could*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, compared [to the] *next* game we're going to see, it's a goddamn *masterpiece*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Lost Word of Jenny 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 25 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Takara 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If there's *any* [particular] genre [that] hardcore gamers [tend to] dismiss, it's [*probably*] gonna be Girl Games (ya know, [like] '*Barbie*' games, [for] example). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, *here* we have Takara's "Lost Word of *JeNnY*", which is, [*sort*] of, like the [first] '*Barbie*' game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [What exactly this] game is [*about*, I'm not] really *sure*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But [it] *begins* with Jenny w... -- appearing in this, [sort] of, [overworld] *town* [and] a *creepy* guy walking *by* [and] *touching* Jenny in [an inappropriate] *way*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 '*Who [exactly]* is *Jenny*?', ya *wonder*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well, Takara*, which is the enormous Japanese *toy* company (also known for creating '*Transformers*', among un... -- many other things) *had* the rights [to] manufacture Barbie dolls [in] *Japan*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though the *Takara* Barbie (as we see *here*) was [*specifically*] designed to *appeal* [to] Japanese *girls*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Eventually*], Takara's rights {to} the '*Barbie*' name *expired*, so they [*renamed*] the doll 'Jenny'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] I [believe that] the ['Jenny'] dolls [are] still being [manufactured and are] popular [*today*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *This is* Takara's second game (after the *horrible, horrible "Transformers*: [Convoy] no *Nazo*"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *this game* is just [as] *bad* [and] is [usually classified] as kusuge in *Japan*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *On this* underworld, you *run around* avoiding a [dangerous] *puppy* [and] a guy [with] a *gun* [and] a *car* looking [for] the open *door*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've found [it], there [are] several *levels*, as you [can] *see*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The first one here is, [sort] of, a *ship* level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [you're] *now* treated to [some] really awful [Platforming] Action. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *idea* is [to collect] the various *objects* on this level (*barrels* in this [*particular*] one) *looking* for the hidden [letter or] something. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Mostly*] they [just] contain an *enemy instead*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Pretty] much* every aspect of this game is [downright] *awful*: graphics, sound, controls, playability. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *why the hell* [are *cute little] puppies* always attacking *Jenny*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's another *level*: a flower-[themed] *level*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some [of] the *enemies* ([such as that] *grasshopper* [or] *locust* - whatever [that] is) are [*virtually*] impossible [to] *kill*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the jumping [controls] are very, very bad. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I *guess* this game gets [*points* just for] general *weirdness* [and] *level design*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This level, for *example*, is *cake*-themed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *But*, uh, *I* [don't] know who [*designed*] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Transformers..." was, uh, done by I.S.C.O. [and] this is certainly *bad* [enough to] be their *work*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] *any* rate, "Lost Word of JeNnY" is [almost certainly] a game to avoid [at] all costs. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Winter Games 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 27 🇯🇵 // 1987 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Action Graphics | Double Atelier
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 // Acclaim 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so "Lost Word of JeNnY" was *terrible*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I wish I [could] promise you a better game *now* - [but *instead*] next up is "*Winter Games*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [title] screen is so *ugly* they [only keep it] up there [for] like *half* a *second*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And as you may have noticed *there*, the [magic] *word, Acclaim*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hurray. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] *Japan*, this was [released] by Pony *Canyon* [for] the FamiCom *Disk System*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But later in 1987, it] became one of the first U.S. releases *from* the notorious shit mongers, Acclaim (which [is] *entirely appropriate* because "Winter Games" is [absolutely] *terrible*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So, we have* a nice (if somewhat [dated] looking) [animated] *intro here*, and then [it'll] take you to the menu's *options*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Winter Games" is *[quite] similar* to Konami's "Track & *Field*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] *four* different Olympic sports you [can *compete] in*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] choose your *country* though [most of] the countries [that actually] do *well* in the Winter *Olympics* (like [East] *Germany*, Sweden, [and] *Finland*, [and] so [on]) are strangely *absent*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *this is a* port of the [1986] Commodore *64* game, [developed] by *Action Graphics* [and published] by Epyx. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It was] one [of] the *games* in Epyx's *enormously* successful *series* [that] included "Summer Games", "California Games", [and] *so on*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Despite Epyx releasing so many [popular *titles*], they *still* [managed to] go *bankrupt* [shortly] *after* this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [can only] *assume* their *executives* spent all the profits on cocaine [and] pastel designer *suits*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Hot Dog Aerials [is] probably the [most] non-awful [of] all the *events*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You use the D-Pad to do various air *tricks*, [and] then ya [get] scored based on the [quantity and] the difficulty of the *tricks*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 (Oops.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Mostly* ya [just, sort] of, press, uh, forward [and] back on the D-Pad [to] do various kinds of flips [and whatnot]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *next* [up] is this, well, really *obnoxious Racing*, uh, Game, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's actually [just] like the 'Track & Field' *running games*; um, [you] have [to] do some button *mashing* ([only] here, it's Left [and] Right on the D-Pad instead of A and B on the *control* pad). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is actually] a [lot] more [obnoxious than] having to press the buttons real quick. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Also] this race is just way too [*long*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [*probably*] the least favorite sport in this, uh, "Winter Games", is the *Figure* Skating *competition*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Much like Hot Dog Aerials, you [need to perform] a number of *tricks* and are then, uh, *graded*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But *figure* [skating] uses a number of obscure [and] non-*intuitive* controller *combos* [to] perform tricks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Mostly*, ya just] fall *down* a lot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And], *by* the way, [that] is [really] one, uh -- *one really ugly* character graphic *used* for your [*skater*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Winter Games" [was *ported* to the] FamiCom by Atelier Double - *one of those* mysterious Japanese [contract developers *and] apparently* a very new *company* ("Winter Games" *must [have]* been one [of] their [first] *jobs*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Pony Canyon* [would] use [them *frequently*] from here on *out*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's *strange* [that] Pony Canyon is [*not very discriminating*] when [it] comes [to] their *developers*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... They would just as soon use someone like Atelier *Double* as they would [someone] like *Compile* (who actually knew how [to] *program* [for] the FamiCom). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I assume you see [what] I mean by falling down a [lot]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] does take, uh, certain timing to... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... There we go! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I even managed to *land* [without] falling down ([pretty] tricky task). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The very [last] game here is this *really* awful Bobsled. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... As is typical of [Computer] Game design around this *time*, the *screen* is *taken* up by these [*unnecessarily*] large *maps* [and] *displays*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You know, what you're] actually looking at -- your, uh, figure going down the *hill* there is [that little] tiny, uh, thing [in] the upper [right] *corner*, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But *what exactly*] is [that] blue *band* [right] *above* [it]? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Is [that] supposed [to] be the *sky*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... So, anyway, uh, the Bobsled event *is [sort] of* a Racing Game [with] *really bad controls*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Winter Games", uh, [sort] of, a *disaster, but* [we're *not*] done [*yet*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [In] fact, *March 27th*, [1987] is [*probably*] gonna go down [as] one [of] the worst days in FamiCom *history*. 🍇🍌

👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *One* of *several* horrible [*titles*] released on the same day [as] "*Winter Games*" is "*Super Boy Allan*...", for the *F.D.S.* (the *second* in this series from *Sunsoft* [and] Ask *Kodansha*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [*I'm not*] really *sure* who [developed] these things or what Kodansha's *connection* is. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Some sources* list *Asmik* as the developer (Asmik being a *venture* involving the Japanese companies, Sumitomo [and] *Kodansha*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Ask Kodansha's name does appear* on video games *occasionally*, sometimes in *conjunction* with *Asmik*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though I'm [not] really sure [what] Ask [Kodansha actually] *does* on these games, *or* who [actually developed] *this* game for [that matter]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Regardless*, it] certainly does [fit into] the pattern of shitty games [that] Sunsoft was *releasing*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 At *any* rate, [about] the game itself: it's another, uh, silly looking *Educational* Game, *this* time with a *lumberjack* theme. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [might] remember the [*first*] game in this series, "Adian no *Tsue*", involved wandering around "...Zelda" type *dungeons* doing math problems. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Super Boy *Allan*" involves rolling *logs* while doing math *problems*... [and, of] course, being [chased] by [giant] *apples*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 An [excellent *example*] of the 'let's [just] throw some random s--- together [and] call it a game' school of design (*quite popular* at this time). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But I'll [admit], I [didn't] really learn [to] play "[Super] Boy *Allan*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [But] how [can] you *blame* me? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Would you wanna waste time playing this *thing*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This looks like] a terrible variation on the '*Eggerland*' games. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Oh, yes*, [and] there *are* actually two games on this cart. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *second* is some [sort] of *running* game, once again involving *fractions*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And once again, ya [*probably* won't] wanna [waste] much *time* on these. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They make "Donkey Kong Jr. *Math*" look like a masterpiece by *comparison*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Chisoko Tairiku Orudora: Chinou Game Series 2 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 27 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Sunsoft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Sunsoft 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Okay*, so one terrible Educational Game from Sunsoft wasn't enough *punishment*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well* then, let's have *another*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your character runs around in circles in a [blind] panic, desperately wishing he [could] escape this game - *as will you* - it is "Chisoko Tairiku Orudora..." (which means *something* like '[Underground] Continent Orudora...'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's *all* [about] this [little] dude who goes underground [and] jumps over *monsters*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *I* [thought] these 'Chinou' games were supposed [to] have some [sort] of educational [*content*] to [them, but] "...Orudora" [doesn't] seem [to] have even *bothered*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, *seriously, why*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 No one [bought] this thing, I assume. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Not sure if that weird little blue line across the top there is [*supposed*] {to} be there [or] *not*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, *as* you [can] see, [this is] a very simple side-scrolling [*Platformer*] with an [underground] *theme*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your *character* (who wears [his cap] *backwards* because he's [got] *attitude) carries bombs with which* to blow up various life forms living underground. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], if you're thinking, 'Hmm, this all looks very *familiar*,' well, *yes*, this [is just like "Atlantis] no *Nazo*" - another terrible Sunsoft *game* [that] came [out] back [in *1986* and was] *almost* released [in] the U.S. [as] "[Super Pitfall] *II*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [underground] *caverns*, the *bombs*, the [general] lack of anything even [remotely] *exciting* - at least [Sunsoft didn't] go through all the trouble of coming [out] with a new *idea* [for] this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Just like* in "Atlantis] no Nazo" it's [*impossible* to -- to pretty] much kill *anything* [with] those damn *bombs*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 On the *plus* side, they've dropped the *timer*, so, uh, [you *can't*] run [out] of time [and] have [to repeat] the *level*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, they -- they *did* make all the exits all *sneaky* [and] *hidden*; I found a [secret exit to] Level *3*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 How many levels *are there*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 No *idea*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [doubt if] anyone's ever bothered [to] *finish* this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *But* you *do* [get a] *bonus* game on this cart. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It is a math Racing Game with a sexy, big-haired, cleavage-showing *character*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess this [involves] racing around [*Europe*] by doing *math* [problems]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There is *no* actual *racing*; [it's just] *math* [problems]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Sunsoft*, my [friends], *please* [stop] making horrible games [like] this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Promise* me this [will] be the last one. *Okay*? 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Nangoku Shirei!! Spy vs. Spy 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 27 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by First Star
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And [our] fourth bad game released on March 27th, *is* "Nangoku *Shirei*!! Spy vs. *Spy*" from *Kemco*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And obviously, this [is] a sequel [to] "Spy vs. *Spy*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And, just like the *first] game*, [it] was [ported] from a U.S. *Computer* Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In *this* case [it] was [1985's] "Spy vs. Spy: The Island *Caper*" (the second of *three* 'Spy vs. Spy' games). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 After selecting [your] *island*, you *find yourself wandering [around]* these, ya [know], rather nice looking, uh, [desert] *islands*, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the *original* [title] was, once again, [developed] by [*First* Star] (even though, uh, who knows who [ported] *this* version). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing they *did* do was [remove] the *Trapulator* (the interface [that] shows you [what you] have in [your] *possession*, [and] allows you [to, sort] of, easily switch [between your] various [traps]). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*While*] the [first] game was [not] *bad*, any fun seems to [have] been drained [out of] the *sequel*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Black [and] White spies [are] both trapped [on] this [island looking for] *missile parts* and that's before ya need to search [around] looking for those parts [and] you [can plant] traps [for your *opponent*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Whereas in the *first*] game, [items] were hidden [behind] picture frames, in drawers, {and} so [on], {and} *so forth*, in *this* case everything is [simply] buried in the *sand*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Encountering] the enemy spy [will], once again, lead to a *fight*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When one guy gets the *missile*, this *crazy tune* starts playing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That] player then [needs] to [find] the sub [and get] *away*... which he does (with a [hot] chick in *tow*, no less). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'll admit], from a *graphical* [standpoint] "Nangoku Shirei!!..." *looks* [better than] the [first] game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] the game [itself] is boring [and *pointless*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Eh... So, [it's] *really* [just] another [utterly forgettable release] from Kemco. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Otocky 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 27 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SEDIC
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by ASCII 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Okay, so we've *just had* four bad games - *all released* on the same day. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I know [you're] thinking, 'Man, this is, like, the worst episode of 'Chrontendo' *ever*', but [I'm actually] gonna make [it up to] ya, [right] now. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Because *on [that]* very same day, "*Otocky*" was released - and "*Otocky*" is *awesome* (something [completely *different* than what we've] seen [for] the FamiCom *before*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Released*] by *ASCII*... [and *apparently* developed] by *Sedic* (whoever *they* are), "Otocky" is a [Horizontal *Shoot*]-'em-Up with a *musical* theme. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However, rather* [than] using a typical canon [or] *laser*, "Otocky" has this weird *balloon* thing which *behaves* [as] if [it] were on a *bungee* cord. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When ya [shoot it out, it] then snaps *back* [and] *returns* [to] you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can shoot it in *eight] directions* using the *D-Pad*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's useful both for, uh, *killing enemies* [and] collecting [*items*] (like the various notes [that] you are attempting to, uh, *collect*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In "*Otocky*" your [*object*] is [to *collect*] those notes [and] *fill* [up] the *meter* in the lower middle of the *screen*, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You *also* collect A [and] *B* [items and that will] change the *sound* [of] the *music [and*] give you a limited-use [secret] *weapon* (fire by using the *B* [button]). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] the *music* is the [great] thing about "Otocky" since firing [your] weapon works [*kind* of like] [playing] a [musical *instrument*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is almost] like a combination [between], like, a [synthesizer] and a [*Shoot*]-'em-Up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's almost, sort] of, a *predecessor* [to] games like "*Rez*". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "*Otocky*" was, [in] *fact*, [the *first*] game designed by Toshio *Iwai*, the *sound* [artist and the] man [behind] games such as the popular "*Electroplankton*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "*Otocky*" is enormously fun [to] play, [and *probably*] the [only *Shooter*] where ya wanna fire [your] gun [for] no *reason* - even if there's nothing [to *shoot*] at. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There are some *annoyances* - uh, [like] the fact [that] your weapon becomes *smaller* as you [take] *damage* (thus making the game *harder* [every] time ya [get] *hit*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And the *boss* [battles are not] very satisfying; we're coming up upon one, *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Once* you've [collected] enough notes, you'll then face the *boss* and then you'll *fire* the collected notes into [the little] *holes* in the [gigantic] musical *notes* (actually a little lame [and not] nearly [as] *fun* as the other regular *levels*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *since* "Otocky" is, [sort] of, like a musical-based *game*, here, [I'm] *going* [to] *do* something unheard of in 'Chrontendo' *so far*, which is [I'm *actually* just] going to [*shut*] up [and let] the game, [sort] of, uh, speak [for *itself* for] a couple [of] minutes and [I'll] then turn up the *volume* for ya. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *in conclusion, "Otocky"* is a super fun game [and *pretty] much* arrived [*completely* out of] the *blue*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] a real [lost] *classic* for the [F.D.S.]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] if ya *do play*, [sort] of, one of these [almost] unknown Japanese-[only] games [for the] FamiCom or F.D.S., {I} mean, [for] God's sake, *play this one*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Dirty Pair: Project Eden 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 March 28 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by [?]
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Some things in this world are [just] so dependable. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The sun [will] rise [and] set, spring [will] follow winter, and every [episode of] 'Chrontendo' Bandai [will release] another uninspired [Platformer] *based on* a [licensed] property. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Last [episode it] was "*Ultraman*..."; this time it's "Dirty Pair: [Project] *Eden*", based on (you guessed it) a manga, anime, [and] animated feature *film*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 'Dirty Pair' is [about] these two ladies who [are] *space* cops, but they are all *sexay*; sometimes they have [to] wear skimpy [*outfits*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "...Project [Eden]" was a [1987 animated] *feature* [and] this game is [supposedly] based on that *film*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This was, [of] course, [not] released [in] the [United] *States*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] this unofficial English translation allows us [to] read the [plot setup]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We saw the guy a few [moments] ago, giving the girls the lowdown on [what] they're [supposed *to] do*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Then you are into the, uh, forced side-scrolling *action*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [You can get crushed] between, uh, blocks [and] the edge [of] the *screen*, there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Grab that *perfume [bottle and] then [your] buddy* [will] show up... and -- [with] a *ship*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then you [can] fly around [and *shoot*] things [and] grab various *objects* (stars, arcs, headphones, visors, {and} so on [and] so forth). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is back when power-ups *really* [didn't] have [to] make any sense. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They [could just] be, sort of, these weird random [*objects*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] game designers [hadn't yet] standardized their [iconography]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, *hearts*, for *example, [don't] refill [your] health* [in] this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *in all* fairness, [while] "[Dirty] Pair..." [is] not a *good* game, the anonymous *developer* (perhaps this, uh, *YUJIX fellow* [mentioned at] the bottom [of the] *screen*) saw fit [to] alternate [Shoot]-'em-Up [and] Platformer Action. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 World 1 is all [*Shoot*]-'em-Up *like*, as we see here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 World 2 is more Adventure-y [and] maze-like - a series of [interconnected] *rooms*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Altogether, there are *four* worlds. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And if you have the patience [to get] through all four... then good [for] you. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sanma no Meitantei 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 April 02 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We *finally* arrive in *April* with our [last] game this episode, *and it's an odd one*: "Sanma no Meitantei". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *First* of all, check [*out*] this really cool opening [*cinematic*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *opening sequences* of video games [are] *slowly* [getting] *cooler* [and] *cooler*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [might] guess [from] watching the game *itself*, this is [yet] another Murder Mystery based *Adventure* Game (*but* with a *difference*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [will] *hopefully* remember [Beat] *Kitano's* video game [from] "Chrontendo Episode *13*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, this game *also* stars a popular Japanese T.V. [personality]/co... -- comedian, Sanma Akashiya. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Not] very [well]-known [in] the [*West*], this guy is *hugely popular* in Japan - one of Japan's biggest pop culture *celebrities*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 His main distinguishing physical characteristic is his [gigantic] [set] of [front] *teeth*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "Sanma no Meitantei" will look familiar [to] those who've seen the earlier *Adventure* Games [for] the FamiCom ("Portopia", "Suishou no Ryuu", [and] *so on*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [have] a bunch of *icons* [that] serve [as your] *main action* menu; there's one [for] Move, Examine, [and] *so on*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But] *this game really* kinda goes [out] on a *limb* compared [to] most [of] the earlier games in this *genre*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have a top-down *overworld* where ya [can] move [around] from location [to] l... -- location. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (Currently, [I'm] in some sort of a *graveyard*, here.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [But what] *really* [sets it apart] are the [little] *minigames* [scattered throughout] the *world*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here*, in order [to get that] *quest* object [at] the side {of} the *screen*, [ya have] {to} dodge all those falling [*objects*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] *this* is *certainly* [not completely] *unhinged*, like the '[Beat] *Kitano*' game was, *there is* a goofy [almost] postmodern [kind] of *feel* to it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, a(uh)nother minigame uses the [*extremely* recognizable] *sound* [effects from] "*Pac*-Man" (which, of course, was [*also*] from *Namco*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*And*] there is a, uh, [sort of], typical Japanese [perverted] sense of *humor* as *well*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [At] one point, when searching this girl's *room*, you [can] find her, uh, *panties* [in] the *bed*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For *some reason*, you use a [little] *crab* to point [out] where [you] want [to] *search*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, [*surprisingly*], this [*doesn't*] seem [like just another] crappy *game*; [that] uses, like, a famous *person* in it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Namco [*apparently* put] a [lot] of [*effort* into] this, [and it *actually*] looks [quite] *interesting*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of *all* the Japanese-[only] *FamiCom* games we've covered so *far*, this *seems really* like [it might] be a good [*candidate*] for a *translation*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Until] then, however*, I *guess* [it's] gonna have [to settle to] be, [sort] of, one [of] those *intriguing-looking* yet still undiscovered FamiCom games. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Apple Town Monogatari: Little Computer People 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 April 04 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Activision | Square
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by DOG 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We now come to [what] is [certainly] the *strangest* entry this *episode*, "Apple Town *Story*: Little Computer *People*", [published] by D.O.G. [and ported] by *Square* from a [1985] U.S. [*Computer*] Game known as [just] "Little [*Computer*] People". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This was [originally designed] by David *Crane* [and] *Activision*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And I [*will* admit] my favorite [part of] the game is the rather charming *intro* with a [great musical] *theme*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The] music is credited to none other than [Nobuo] *Uematsu*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [We'll] take a [second just] to listen [to] the *music, here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you may [have noticed] the, uh, rather primitive, uh, speech intro [in] the game, *there*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *So*, [what, sort] of, game is *this*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Well*, it's, *[sort] of*, an early *God* Game, uh, / Artificial *Life* Simulation. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} takes place [entirely] inside this *house* where this *young girl* [and her *cat*] live. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [get] to rather voyeuristically spy on [her] *actions* and *have a* certain [amount] of control over what [she] does. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If this sounds [a little like] "The *Sims*", then *yes*, [it] *is*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Will] Wright *has confirmed* [that] the old Commodore *64* game "[Little Computer] *People*" was *one* [of] the *inspirations* for "The *Sims*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [there] *are* [some] strange *differences*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... "Apple Town Story" [*occasionally*] gives us these weird cutscene like close ups, um, ([which] *are* a [little] *weird*; there she was brushing her *teeth*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], *you [can interface]* with the girl using the *control* bar up [at] {the} *top*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] example, you [can make] the phone ring, give -- have [her to get something to] eat, make her play the piano, {and} so on, [and] *so* forth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you *[also] have* a very, uh, limited [amount of interaction] with her; [you can] play {a} game [of] cards, [and] so on, [and] *so forth*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya know, she *keeps*] going [into that] room [and] *bringing* something out. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] I've *never* really been able [to] figure out [*exactly* what it] *is*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Obviously, that's not] the *fridge* so she's [not getting] something [to] *eat*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Here] we see [her pick up the] phone. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Notice*] the rather, uh, *gratuitous* bend over panty shot *there* (um, something [that] was [definitely] added [to the] Japanese *version* - in {the} *U.S. version*, [your character was always] *male*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! S... -- Here we see, uh, talking to the *girl*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It} [looks like] she's, [sort] of, giving you the, uh -- the double flip off... [for] some strange reason. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And here's [one of] the li'l card games [that] you [can] *play*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [*unfortunately, while* this] is a [pretty] unique idea for a game, a *[little] something* was lost [in] the [translation]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *original* "[Little Computer People]" had a number [of] features [*completely] missing* from this FamiCom port. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh, [*here's*] a [little] *piano* playing scene. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, nice music - [it] [*almost* kinda] looks forward [to] the piano [playing in] the 'Final [*Fantasy*' games]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In the *original version*, your *character* had, [sort of], randomly [generated] name [and] *stats*, [and] you [could *actually type*] a [*pretty] large* number [of] *commands* in, using {the} *keyboard*, and he would [*sometimes*] react in rather unexpected *ways*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [His], um... -- [The] *whole thing* was *much* more [*interactive* and] *Simulation*-like. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *FamiCom [port]* is *more* [just], like, about, like, *watching* the girl go [about] her *business* [around] the *house*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [suppose this is an] early *example* of a *P.C.* game being, [sort of, *dumbed] down* for [release] on a *console*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Green Beret 🇯🇵 // Rush'n Attack 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1987 April 10 🇯🇵 // 1987 April [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Konami
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Konami 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Our] final game this *episode* is [yet another] F.D.S. *title* and is once again by *Konami* (and would become one of the most well-loved early [Konami] *games*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *is* Konami's early Run-'n'-Gun *classic, "Green Beret"* (known [in] the [*West*] as "*Rush'n' Attack*"). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It starts [with] one [of] the coolest intros seen so *far*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This must [have] really blown away gamers [with it's] *coolness* back [in *1987*]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Your *mission* is [to infiltrate what] is *clearly* a Soviet *army* base [and] destroy some [sort] of *[secret] weapon*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "*Green* Beret" is [actually] a [port] of [Konami's 1985] *Arcade* Game, as [we'll] see *here*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In the *Arcade* version, your *mission* is [to] rescue some *P.O.W.s*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *home* version has been substantially *changed*; [it] has more *levels* [for] *one* thing. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, uh, *one* [of the] things I do miss from the Arcade version is the [fact that] you *can* obtain [that] most *unhumanitarian* of all weapons: the *flamethrower*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *For* the American *N.E.S.* release, the game kept its U.S. *Arcade* [title] "Rush'n' *Attack*". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[And there] were a* few minor *changes*, such as you [start] the game with *five* lives instead of *three*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *However, we'll* be going hardcore [and] playing the *original* version [today]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, [for] *some reason*, despite the [fact that] you [are] on an *extremely* [important] Top Secret *mission*, your [*superiors* decided to] go all '[Metal] *Gear*' [and] *send* you in [without] being heavily *armed*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [*spend most* of] the game [with just] a small *knife*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess [that] being an elite "Green *Beret*" you *really* [don't] need *guns* [to] take on [an] entire enemy *army* base. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Furthermore, you* [would] never actually [dirty your *hands*] by *picking* up [foreign] *rifles*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 On *occasion* you *will* grab a *bazooka* or a *grenade*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In [fact], the *bazooka is* [necessary] to finish the *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There *is a* very rare *gun* in "Rush'n [Attack" that] you *can* pick up [*but it only lasts* for] a few seconds. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the *controls* [in this] game do take [some getting] *used* to. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 To *jump* you press *Up* on the *D-Pad*; I'd earlier [*dismissed*] this same *control* configuration [for] Capcom's "*Trojan*" back [in] "...Episode *14", but* in "*Green* Beret", *[it] works*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, "*Green* Beret" is a very straightforward *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's, I guess one [of the most] linear games you [can] possibly *imagine*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *More* [than anything] else, it's a game [about] *timing*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Most* [enemies] you [can] simply *stab* - though *jumping* [enemies] require you to jump up [in] the air [and *hit*] them in *midair*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Shooting* enemies will] require [you to] *duck*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] *all* very *simple* [but] *this game* has a reputation [for] *difficulty*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It] *is* [quite *beatable* if] you *play [it]* right. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [will] need [to] master the [art] of *killing* [multiple] enemies [in] one *jump*, however. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Each [of the] six levels ends in a *boss* [battle]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The, uh, rather *easy first* level you saw a *second* ago [ends with] simply a wave [of] *troops* being sent at you (a *piece* [of] *cake* if you decided [to] use [your] *bazooka* like *I did*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *[Later] levels [tend]* to [pit] crazier though [still somewhat realistic] bosses *against* you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Much like* in "*Castlevania*", the bosses *can* be *easy* if you [battle them] *correctly*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, there *are* hidden [underground] *passages* [in] the game, uh, which [can] be *uncovered* by blowing up [*landmines*]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of *course, why* would anyone [put] down [*landmines inside*] of their own *base*? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, there *is* a *very* slight element of nonlinearity *in* this *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *levels [get]* consecutively more *difficult*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This [*2nd*] Level, *here*, adds [*shooting* enemies to] the mix. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [*secret* of] the game is not to rush *through* it (ironic, considering the American [*title*]) [but] rather [to] move forward slowly [and] methodically, [letting] [the enemies] come [to] you [and] *impale* [themselves] on [your] *knife*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Here* we're seeing some [of] the *bosses* [from] some of the, uh -- the *middle* stages [in] the *game*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They're really [perhaps, not as], uh, [*difficult*] as they [might] *appear* [to] be on [first] *glance*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The *level design* is very *simple*, and really [can't] compare [to anything] "*Castlevania*" [but the] [*backgrounds* are] nicely *done* (like this, uh, [little] *bridge* scene, *here*). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Everything*] is very *clean*-looking, [yet] detailed [at the] same *time*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [While] the *entire game* takes place on a military *installation*, each level [is *distinct-looking* [and] there's [enough] variation [to] hold [your] *interest*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... "Green Beret" [isn't] really a [*Platforming*] Game, [but] *every level* gives you the option of moving along the ground or using ladders [to] access a *higher path*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] *speaking* of *ladders*, they [will] be your worst enemy [in] this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Jumping while in [*front of*] a ladder [will] cause you [to] land *on* the ladder [and] *cling* to [it] [completely *vulnerable* to] enemy *attacks*, unable to attack *or* jump *off*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Likewise, *ducking* while *over* a ladder [will] cause you [to] climb *down* it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The [moral of] the story *is*: advance slowly [and] *carefully*, stop where there are no *ladders, then* attack. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *here's* this final *cool* level; you saw the very nicely done *jets* [in] the background. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... [Remember] the [art] in this game is *great*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [For] the *final battle* you must destroy the [secret] weapon, [which] turns [out to] be some *missile* of some *sort*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Since the Soviets [had *plenty*] of [intercontinental nuclear] *missiles*, [what could] be so [special about] *this one*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Well], ya have to*, uh, [shoot it] with [your] *bazooka* a bunch [of] times. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And if you run [out] of *ammunition*, ya have to kill enemies [and get] some *more*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [*Since* there are] so many [enemies] *on* this final [battle], they -- they flood the screen so [*completely* that] you'll have a hard time *landing* [without] being *killed*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, I *hope* you saved your lives and, uh, bazookas for the final boss [battle]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, *once* you've, uh, [destroyed] the [secret] weapon, you [get] one more [completely] awesome cutscene [*and*] the game congratulates you [for] bringing world *peace*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though [it would] *seem [that* invading] a [Soviet] *army* base [and] blowing *up* a bunch of stuff would [*actually*] more likely *increase* [hostilities] and probably start a war. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But it's [only] a video game and a darn fine one at that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Konami must have liked it because I believe that this, along with "Track & Field," was the, uh, one of the very first Konami releases in the U.S. for the Nintendo Entertainment System. 🍇🍌
