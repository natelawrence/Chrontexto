👓🏮🍊🎇# 🗨️ Introduction to Chrontendo Episode 10 ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hello, and welcome to the special tenth episode of 'Chrontendo'. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 That's 150 games so far! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {It} sounds like a lot, but we've actually just barely scratched the surface [of] the FamiCom releases. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 I wish I could say that this was a special episode, but it's actually just a [pretty] average selection of games this week. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 We will see a [pretty good] game from Hudson this episode, as well as the FamiCom debuts of SNK and Victor. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Also a surprisingly good game from Bandai, as well as more atrocities from Kemco and Toei. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, we'll start this episode out with an original Platformer from Taito. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Musashi no Ken: Tadaima Shugyou Chuu 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 August 08 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Taito
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Taito 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Let's kick off this episode with a game that probably most of you won't be familiar with, "Musashi no Ken..." ('The Sword of Musashi'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [it] probably is [pretty] obvious; this is a, uh, side-scroller - rather a cute-looking little thing - kind of in the style of "Super Mario Bros.", [only], of course, you have a sword. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Musashi no Ken..." was based on a manga about a young Kendo student (Kendo being {the} Japanese art of swordsmanship). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You probably won't be surprised if I told you [that] there [was] actually an animated TV series on the air at the time this game came out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In this game, you travel [across] levels, avoiding various monsters and picking up swords (some of which are actually hidden in the various things that you can hit). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You will also occasionally get power-ups (things that, uh, fill up your Life Bar, et cetera.). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the whole time, you have [to] keep up with your dog, which is racing there below you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The dog moves relatively slowly, so it's not really *that* difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing about this game is the controls are a little weird, and sometimes the platforming can be a bit more difficult than you think it should be. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, the enemies [can] get quite heavy as well, especially the amount of things that just fall out of the sky on you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, the end of this level right here... (I believe this [is] the second level) ...ya have to avoid all those boulders while doing the platforming. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It was] actually kind of difficult and took me a few tries [to] get through this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I think perhaps this game, uh, sort of took the '...M...' -- '...Mario...' formula and kind of made it just maybe a little bit more difficult than it needed to be. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game really isn't that fun, simply because it involves so much memorization of exactly what is going [to] fall [out] of the sky on you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] take, like, maybe two or three hits at most before you die. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, we see some of the more, sort of, frustrating platforming you'll be encountering in the game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} not really a great game - {it} doesn't quite work. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 One thing that's a little odd is that after you get through (I believe it is) three levels, it then becomes, sort of, like, a little miniature Fighting Game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's actually why you're collecting all [those] little swords and whatnot throughout these levels; you're saving up for when you actually use them while you're fighting. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I will admit, I definitely have not mastered the controls during the sword-fighting competition and... had a very difficult time actually hitting the other guy before [he] hits me. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I believe it's, uh, two out of three. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though if ya do get past this, you'll actually go through some more side-scrolling levels and then a second competition, and then (I believe) that's [pretty] much the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this is a weird little game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I [can't] really recommend it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... It tries to be a decent side-scroller but doesn't quite make it. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# ⚠️ Warning ✨


👓🏮🍊WARNING 🍋 🍋 🍊🍓 SENSITIVE GAMERS 🍋 PLEASE BE ADVISED: 🍊 THE FOLLOWING GAME 🍋 IS DOG SHIT 🍇



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Hokuto no Ken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 August 10 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Shouei System
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Toei Animation 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 From Toei animation, it's "Hokuto no Ken". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is a video game based on the animated series which we like to call 'Fist of the North Star'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Please note that this is not the "Fist [of the North] Star" game that was released for the N.E.S. in the United States. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That was actually "Hokuto no Ken 2". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And when you play this game, probably the first thing you'll say is, 'Jesus! This game is awful!'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Look at, uh -- Look at the -- the character sprites when you kick them! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They go flying through the air with their legs flailing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... I have not been able to figure out what that little guy right there does. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He always appears in that same section, but... you can't seem to collect him or do anything with him. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], you [can] do a Kick or a Jump. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 When you hit someone (just like in the comic book), they actually explode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can then grab that little word that comes out of the pink guys when you hit them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This will, sort of, power you up; notice ya get a little star up in the corner, there, whenever ya hit one of these guys. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 People will throw things at you; you have to avoid them; you have a Life Bar there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, for those not familiar with the comic book and cartoon, this takes place in some kind of horrible post-apocalyptic world, where, uh, lots of punks wander around killing people, and your job is [to], sort of, just, sort of, beat them up repeatedly. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And once you power up all the way (you grab the last word there), suddenly, 'Blam!' you, sort of, Hulk out and your t-shirt gets all ripped. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you [can] go a [little bit] faster and, uh, do things like Kick and Punch while in the air, but it doesn't really make the game any better. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, ya know, unlike a lot of terrible games, [this] one is actually fun in, sort of, a stupid kind of way - at least for a few minutes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Part of the problem is that... this level never really seems to end. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You just, sort of, keep going [until] you have eventually run out Hit Points. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... It -- It is [identified] as Level 1 on the title screen, so I assume eventually you'll get to the end, but I've never been able to. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {That's} not to mention that when you die, you start at the very beginning of a level again. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya just, sort of, go past the same buildings over and over again, fight the same three guys over and over again; there's absolutely no variation in this game whatsoever. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Note [that] this game was actually developed by a company called Shouei [System] ({the} same ...s -- guys who [designed] "Baltron", under the name of 'Bear's'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess these guys kind of like to hide under, uh, different names. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If these are the kind of games they're coming up with, I can't say I blame 'em. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Jajamaru no Daibouken 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 August 22 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Jaleco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It looks like we're getting our ninja quota in early this episode. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yep! This is another 'Jajamaru' game from Jaleco, "Jajamaru no Daibouken" (which is 'Jajamaru's Big Adventure'). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya might remember the last 'Jajamaru' game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was, uh -- The princess had been kidnapped by this, sort of, pirate dude. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, uh, apparently, the same thing has happened again! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, this game is actually a little different. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... The last 'Jajamaru' game we saw mostly consisted of about three or four different levels, which simply repeated over and over again. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is more like a "Super Mario..."-style scrolling deal. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And in between every level you actually encounter, sort of, an optional Boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I say he's optional because - if [ya] get killed, {it's} no big deal; you don't lose a life. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 If you defeat him, ya get some bonus points. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [So] this game actually alternates [between] scrolling levels and Bosses. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, the first level is a scroller, second level: Boss, {and} so on and so forth, [until] ya get to Level 10 - in which case the Boss is the actual pirate guy himself. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As in the previous 'Jajamaru' game, you can find a variety of power-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can also, in this game, find, uh, *bad* power-ups, uh, such as little *bombs* [that] if you try to grab them, they'll *explode* on you. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You battle enemies in the same way; you can jump on them, uh, {and} hit them with your little throwing stars. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Oh! Here is sort of an invisibility power-up, which actually makes you temporary in... --  temporarily [invulnerable]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You collect little Gold coins. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Really nothing has changed, except for the sort of, layout [of] the levels because they're sort of long, horizontal, scrolling levels (presumably under the influence of "Super Mario Bros."). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, one of the power-ups you can find is... the Gigantic Frog! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This guy will [only] last you part [of] the level now (because [the] levels are somewhat longer than they used to be). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But he can still [pretty] much plow through any enemy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This level [is] a little weird; it appears that it takes place in a, uh -- a city park of some sort! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I'm not really sure exactly what the plot of this game is! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, you're trying to rescue a princess, but, uh, you're going through a lot of unusual places. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the 9th Level; there's the, uh, exit, right down there at the bottom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I'll jump into it, and then I'll be fighting the Final Boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you actually get to fight him while on the Giant Frog! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, for you fans of the Giant Ninja Frog, uh, this level will give you a -- a bit more of a chance to actually use the guy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Though, this is actually harder than fighting him in the o... -- in the other game! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Because now he, sort of, jumps around and throws fireballs at you (more like a real Boss) rather th... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 (I guess [he's] throwing bombs at you, technically; you throw fireballs at him.) 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] have to hit [him] several times, he'll, uh, start getting, uh, -- turning a little red there, and then finally, 'Blam!' you have rescued the princess! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, after this, then you, uh, start again with actually some new levels! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 ({I'm} not really sure how many levels there are altogether in this game.) 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But clearly Jaleco was attempting [to], sort of, update the series a little bit, uh, - from the, uh, single-screen levels of the first game - to the slightly larger levels of the second game - to, uh, this one right here, which is almost becoming more and more like a traditional side-scrolling game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Certainly, uh, I'd say [that] these, uh, 'Jajamaru' games are [probably] among Jaleco's better games (they've released some real stinkers for the FamiCom). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These games are not great, but they're are a lot of fun! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I mean, certainly there are much worse Platformers on the, uh, FamiCom at this point. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Sky Kid 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 August 22 🇯🇵 // 1987 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Namco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 // Sunsoft 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 From Namco, we now have "Sky Kid". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this was released the same day as "Jajamaru no Daibouken". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And if you looked at the little, uh, cover shot we showed earlier, you'll see this is actually the 18th game from Namco released [for] the FamiCom, so far. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Thus making them, far and away, the most prolific publisher of FamiCom games (other than Nintendo themselves). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Namco had been releasing games since September of 1984; [so] that translates [into] almost a game a month! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Sky Kid" is a [port] of their 1984 [Arcade] game (this is the Arcade version, here). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The FamiCom version has... not quite as good colors, but otherwise looks [pretty] similar to the Arcade version. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The object is [to] control your little, uh, Red Baron-style plane, pick [up a] bomb ([which], for some reason, is lying in the middle [of] the road), and, uh, drop it on some kind of fortress... or something similar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Why they couldn't actually supply you *with* a bomb before you started your mission is anybody's guess. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Interestingly, when this game [came] out in the United States (about a year later), [it] was actually [released] by Sunsoft. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} not sure exactly why this was, but my guess would be that Namco was releasing so many games themselves [in] the US. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 At the time, apparently, Nintendo of the United States had a five-game per l... -- year limit for publishers. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, presumably, uh, Namco sold off the U.S. rights [to] Sunsoft. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In terms of gameplay, "Sky Kid" [reminds] me an awful lot of "Choplifter" - sort of fly around, dodge things on the ground, dodge other airplanes, and occasionally pick something up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, just like "Choplifter", I don't really *like* this game! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I can't say exactly why I had a hard time controlling the plane. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The enemy planes seem hell-bent on performing little kamikaze attacks and crashing *into* you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [have] a little loop maneuver you [can] do, but I didn't really find it all that helpful in getting rid of enemy planes. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, based on my somewhat limited gameplay, [I'm] gonna [have to say this] game really does not impress me very much. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 I am a Teacher - Super Mario no Sweater 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 August 27 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Royal Kougyou
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Nintendo 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Most of the FamiCom Disk games released so far [have] been by Nintendo. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But now that we're starting to see third-party publishers release them, we're gonna see some kind of weird stuff. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For example, "I am a Teacher: Super Mario no Sweater" (or 'Super Mario no Seta', as it actually says in Japanese). 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And this is not a game, per se, but rather [an instructional] game on how to make a Super Mario sweater! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game was published by Royal (otherwise known as Royal Kougyou), which I believe is a [pretty] decent-sized Japanese sewing machine manufacturer(?), and they also sell knitting supplies and that sort of thing. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, basically you simply, uh, select the kind of sweater you wanna make, put in the, uh, size - the dimensions and so on {and} so forth - and it'll give you patterns for making the sweater! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, [I'm] not sure exactly who developed this game, but I've heard that Nintendo, themselves, actually may have done it. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 This game is interesting, if, for no other reason, than this is the first time (I believe) that Nintendo has let another game company use its characters, such as Super Mario! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They would obviously do this again [in] the future with games like "Mario is Missing". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, in terms of a gamer's perspective, there's really not much to look at here. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, I suppose that if you read Japanese and are interested in knitting, maybe you should take a look at this! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You can actually make a sweater featuring, uh, Super Mario or other characters from the games! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 But this is certainly, sort of, indicative of the kind of unusual stuff we'll be seeing for the F.D.S. in {the} future. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Mobile Suit Gundam: Hot Scramble 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 August 28 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Game Studio
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Bandai 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our last game for the month of August is "Kendu Senshi Z Gundam: Hot Scramble". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And yes, this is a game based on the incredi... -- [incredibly] popular Japanese anime, 'Gundam' (specifically the second series, 'Mobile Suit Z Gundam'). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] go ahead [and] read the scroll, there, which describes the basic plot [to] you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But 'Gundam' is some sort of overly-complicated Space Opera, involving different armies that dress up in robot outfits [and] shoot each other. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You can tell this game is for hardcore 'Gundam' [geeks because it actually] gives ya descriptions of all the Gundams that appear in the game, as well as things like how much they weigh and what kind of engine they have. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Since [this is] a Bandai game, you're probably thinking, 'Oh no. This was developed by, uh, Tose.' ({the} same guys who did those horrible games like "Chubby Cherub"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But no! This [was] developed by Game Studios! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And if ya haven't heard of them, well, they were actually the studio that was founded by Masanobu Endô - the same guy who created "Xevious" after [he] left Namco. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, for a Bandai game, it's actually [pretty] decent! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It starts out with a, uh, first-person pseudo-3D, uh, Shoot-'em-Up phase, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You're actually flying over the surface of Earth (which apparently someone has very conveniently painted different colors of green squares). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 [You] battle some enemy, uh, mobile suits, then ya fly off into outer space [and] battle some more! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once ya shoot down enough of 'em, you eventually approach an enemy ship. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And [this] section [of] the game... actually works [pretty] well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 (Ah! There, [I'm] headed [to] the space station). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And then the be... -- game becomes a clone of "Thexder", of all things! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, this handles and looks an *awful lot* like "Thexder" (including the ability to transform between a jet plane and your robot guy). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, just like "Thexder", it can be a little bit tricky to control. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Ya [can] actually find power-ups [in] this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you get [through] the maze, you attack the Boss (which is... apparently is nothing more than a generator of some sort). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And unfortunately, you have to transform [into] your jet plane [to] do this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You actually can't reach him with your robot suit guy because he can't jump high enough! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So you're forced [to] awkwardly fly around this little tiny room in jet plane form. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's really not much fun. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 After that, you're back [to] Earth, blow up some more mobile suits, go [into] space, [and do] the whole thing again! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Altogether, there's 25 levels, but the levels seem [to] be [pretty] similar, [as] far [as] I could tell - slightly different layout, uh, of the space stations and the enemies get harder and harder. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, other [than] that, there's really not a whole lot of variation in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This was one [of] the first 'Gundam' games released for a home system. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [had] been one on the M.X. --  M.S.X. before this, but [it] certainly wasn't the last because they would, over the years, make many, many, many, many, many dozens of 'Gundam' games (I mean, really more than anybody could possibly [want]). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I honestly think that the, uh, 'Gundam' game franchise [probably] generates more revenue than the GDP of a lot of small European nations. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's really quite absurd how many [of] these things [that] they actually put out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... This one, though, is certainly not bad. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... And I guess we can say it's [pretty] good for a Bandai game! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 ASO: Armored Scrumm Object 🇯🇵 // Alpha Mission 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 09 🇯🇵 // 1987 October [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by SNK
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by SNK 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We now enter the month of August with ASO (Armored Scrum Object) - better known in the U.S. as "Alpha Mission". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is the first game published for the FamiCom by SNK, and it's a port of their 1985 Arcade Shooter! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 It was around 1985 that Arcade Shoot-'em-Ups started introducing, sort of, unusual versions of, uh, power-up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, "Gradius" [will] be one good example. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is, uh, perhaps not so well-known as "Gradius" but also has a rather strange system for collecting power-ups. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You have to bomb the little pyramids, and you'll find a letter underneath them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Collecting the letter will then give you some sort of power-up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... For example, 'E's give you Energies, 'M's g... uh -- upgrade your Missiles, the 'L' will upgrade your Laser, and so on [and] so forth. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You will also find power-ups that'll give you access to various Special Weapons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the Special Weapons is what the Energy is used for. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Every time you fire your Special Weapon, it uses up a certain amount of Energy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you have the Energy counter down there in the lower right-hand corner. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Then, at any time, you [can] go [into] your Special Weapons screen and select which kind of Special Weapon you want [to] use. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you use it, it'll use up Energy. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We are now ready [to] fight the first Boss. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I find that the, uh -- the fire is quite useful [for] taking care [of] this guy, so we'll select that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And now we shoot a [constant] stream of, like, uh, hot fire, uh, which we keep, uh, on this guy, and that'll take care of [him pretty] quickly. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, the Energy is going down steadily. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once we're done, we want to, uh, turn off the Special Weapon. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And then we're on to Level 2 (which actually looks quite a bit like Level 1)! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There's also various *negative* power-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... For example, the 'F' (you don't wanna hi... -- hit that) or there's the backwards 'E' (that will *decrease* your Energy). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you get a bit further in the game, you'll probably have collected quite a few, uh, Special Weapons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 We'll take a look at some [of] them here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] see, there's quite a few. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... Some are actually less interesting than they sound. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Like, 'Nuclear' sounds [pretty] cool. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's basically a bomb that [will] destroy any, uh, in-air enemies on the screen. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But [it] really doesn't look very [impressive]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You would think with -- something with a name like 'Nuclear' would give you a better screen [than] that. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, I guess, ya know, the FamiCom was [only] limited to certain, uh, graphic capabilities. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The Octo is quite useful; it shoots off, uh, lasers in eight directions. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 But one thing about this game is that - this all sounds very fun, but I think the fact that the Special Weapons drain so much Energy so quickly really makes them not very useful. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This means that you have all these cool weapons, but you really can't use them that frequently. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe we've been spoiled by modern Shooters, but in this game, you'll be using your regular Laser 90% of the time, which really drains some [of] the fun out of it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} a nice game but would be a lot more fun if you could actually use these weapons more frequently. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Pitfall 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 05 🇯🇵 // 1987 November [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Micronics
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 // Activision 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 From Pony Canyon, of all people, we have "Super Pitfall". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Despite what the screen says, this game was actually programmed by Micronics. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, of course, this is a sequel to "Pitfall!" and "Pitfall II..." (two of the, uh, greatest games for the Atari 2600) originally published by Activision, as you can see here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Pitfall! (I)" was really one [of] the very first horizontal Platform-type Games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Originally, it came out in 1982. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was followed up by a much larger, more ambitious sequel, "Pitfall II: The Lost Caverns", in 1984 (perhaps the last great game for the Atari 2600). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Pitfall II..." was really a [little] bit ahead of its time. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Rather than the strict linear motion of [the] first "Pitfall!", you could explore a rather large cavern in virtually any way that you wanted. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As I mentioned last episode, this type of gameplay would let... -- later evolve [into] games like "Metroid". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If you want {an} example of how to piss off fans of a particular series, look no further than "Super Pitfall". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 On the surface, it greatly resembles "Pitfall II..." (in fact, it's almost a remake). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You start off a... -- above ground and descend into an enormous cavern in search of your [lost] niece. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, you can tell this game doesn't have your best interest [at] heart because the very first ladder [that] you climb down drops you onto a pit of spikes. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I suppose that some sort of [general] rule of game design is, 'You shouldn't put some kind of inescapable death trap, you know, one second into the beginning of the game.'. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, once you're safely underground, you'll find yourself exploring a vast network full of, uh, caverns, passages, tunnels, ladders, lakes, et cetera, et cetera. (just like in "Pitfall II..."). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Obviously, the graphic style of the game has been completely [reworked]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This looks, uh, much more Nintendo-esque, and people have, sort of, commented on the fact that Pitfall Harry now carries a gun and has a mustache, [sort] of like Mario. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's one [of] the cooler parts of the game; you can find a hole in this lake that'll drop you down to the very bottom [of] the cavern. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This, sorta, gives you an idea of exa... -- approximately how big the world is. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So far, the game looks fine. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, once you start playing, you'll realize there are some problems. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Super Pitfall" has some very unpleasant sequences in it (for example, trying [to] catch, uh, these swinging vines). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This, of course, is something taken straight out [of] the first "Pitfall!" game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, while in the first "Pitfall!", grabbing on the blinds was quite easy, in this game it's very difficult, and you will often find yourself, uh, falling [onto] the level below. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 I guess I'll, uh, try it again, here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 No? Still no luck. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya just, sort of, pass right through the vine, unless you grab it just right, so [that] you grab ahold of the [end]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Something else new [to] "[Super] Pitfall" is the idea of locked doors. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yes, unlike "Pitfall! (I)" (where ya [can [pretty] much] explore anywhere ya want), in "Pitfall II..." you find doors [and, in] order to unlock them, ya have to collect the little symbols (uh, the diamond, the heart, the spade, and the club that you see in the upper right-hand corner, there). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, in theory, this wouldn't be so bad, [except] the fact that virtually everything in this game is hidden. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That's right; every single object you need to complete the game is actually invisible. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can [only] uncover it by jumping up in the air near it; then it'll appear. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Additionally, in order to get to the second part [of] the game, you have [to] find the teleporter, which is actually hidden inside of an enemy. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Jumping [into] that vulture will now take you to the next part (which looks exactly like the first part, at first glance). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This gives the game a very, sort of, "...Tower of Druaga" kind of feel - where, [in] order [to] complete the game, you'll have [to] find a number of completely randomly hidden items. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In other words, it's one [of] those 'run around aimlessly until ya get lucky' kind of games that Japanese gamers seem [to] like so much. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's another hidden item right there that ya need to get before ya can actually finish the game. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And here I'm finding, uh, my first objective (or one of the objectives), which is my niece's pet leopard, Quickclaw, who looks much cuter in this game than he did in prior, uh -- the original "Pitfall II...". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But once you've gotten through all the stuff on this first hidden level, ya have to find the second hidden level, which is actually... will, uh, teleport [ya] {to} some kind of, like, strange, uh, parallel universe. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is done by... basically just jumping into a random wall. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In here, the monsters are, uh, much scarier and, uh, much more difficult. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, there was really nothing like this part [of] the game at all in the original "Pitfall II..." game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, eventually, you'll find your niece, and then you have to backtrack all the way [to the] very beginning where ya started. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, all in all, Micronics' typically sloppy programming, the kind of bad controls, and the (uh) general unplayability [of] the game *really* results in a game that most 'Pitfall!' fans did not like. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I [can] certainly see why. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I really think the problems [with] this game go far beyond the redesign of Pitfall Harry. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game itself is really not a lot of fun to play. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In the US, this game was released by Activision themselves, and I'm sure this did nothing to improve [their] reputation. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 At this time, Activision was releasing some rather mediocre games, as we'll see a little bit later in this episode. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Banana 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 09 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Victor Music Industries
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Victor Music Industries 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our next game here is a cute little Puzzle Game called "Banana"! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game, sort of, resembles "Dig Dug", in a way (as we'll see in just a moment). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your character is, I believe, a mole who has [to] dig around, uh, underground passages and collect various kinds of food. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He also needs to collect his wife and then together find the exit door. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Gravity plays a major part [in] this game, as anything without a firm ground underneath it (including yourself) will fall. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike some [of] these games, however, falling rocks won't actually harm you. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The worst they [can] do is block your way because you can't climb over them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Another important factor in this game is the ladders. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ladders are actually the [only] way [that] you [can] use to move up in this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [It's] actually quite easy to find yourself [in a] position where you've lost the level because you've gotten all the way down to a certain point, and then you cannot climb up again because there are no ladders within reach. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, if I go *down* here, I'm [pretty] much stuck. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I'll] have to hit the A and B button, which will [end] the level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 They make that weird little face when ya end a neve... -- level, for some reason. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Throughout the game, you collect various kinds of fruit (including *bananas*), and sometimes these will actually give you bonus items. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Banana" [is] a very cute little game, but maybe it's most noted for being the very first, uh, FamiCom game published by Victor Music Industries. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This may have actually been their first video game ever; I'm not sure. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Later, they became known as Victor Interactive. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Victor Music Industries is [a] subsidiary of the giant entertainment and electronics company, JVC. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 They're the guys who, among other things, invented the VHS videotape. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike a lot of other uh, entertainment companies, like Pony Canyon, Victor actually [had its] own development team. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game was [developed] by Victor themselves. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Probably the most well-known series of video games from Victor is the 'Harvest Moon' games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Victor Interactive eventually got bought by a company called Marvelous Entertainment, who today still publishes the many, many 'Harvest Moon' games [that] still come out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 At any rate, back to "Banana". 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, we [can] see one [of] the slightly later levels - one [that] also has, uh, multiple *doors* (and multiple ladders)! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You had [to] be very, very careful on these later levels; it's quite easy [to find yourself] {in a} position where you're not able [to] finish the level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This, right here, is one [of] the much later levels (I think well after Level 100 - maybe Level 101 or so?). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can] see, the level is quite huge ({it} requires several screens). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, when you first play this level, it's not gonna be at all obvious how to actually get through it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here, we have an even later level; I think there was maybe 105 levels altogether. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, these levels [will] take quite a [bit] of, um, sort of, wandering around, seeing what [it] looks like, and then very careful planning [before you'll] actually [be] able [to] complete the level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 These late levels do obtain a "Lode Runner"-like difficulty level. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Takahashi Meijin no Bouken Jima 🇯🇵 // Adventure Island 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 12 🇯🇵 // 1988 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Escape | Hudson Soft
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Hudson Soft 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The closest we get to a classic game this episode is this title: Hudson's "Takahashi Meijin no Bouken Jima" (or, as it is known in the West, "Adventure Island"). 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The history behind this game is actually quite odd. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's an altered port of Sega's 1986 Arcade game, "Wonder Boy". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 "Wonder Boy" was developed by a company called WestOne and, through a rather unique-sounding arrangement, WestOne controlled the rights [to] the actual game, while Sega controlled the characters and the name “Wonder Boy”. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thus, WestOne [was] able to license the game [to] Hudson, as long [as] new characters were created. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hudson's solution [to the] need for a new main character was very unusual! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 They decided [to] base the new character on [an] actual Hudson employee, Toshiyuki Takahashi, who was also quite well-known for being a very good video game player, possessing the ability [to hit] the 'Fire' button 16 times a second while playing "Star Soldier". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Thus, the new character was called 'Takahashi Meijin', which can be translated to 'Master Takahashi' 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Wonder Boy" and "Adventure Island" ended up being developed [into two] separate franchises, with the 'Wonder Boy' games veering more into med... medieval Fantasy settings, while 'Adventure Island' kept the prehistoric island approach. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 {The} history of this series is somewhat confusing, so we'll do a quick rundown of the games. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# 🌠 Wonder Boy Series Overview ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, the whole thing started with the release of Sega/WestOne's "Wonder Boy" in the arcades in 1986. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sega released a straight home version [of] the game for the Sega Master System. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And then Hudson Soft released the game that we know as "Adventure Island" for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 At this point, the two series ('Wonder Boy' and 'Adventure Island') [pretty] much diverged completely. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The first "Wonder Boy" sequel, Sega/WestOne's "Wonder Boy in Monster Land", hit the arcades in 1987. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sega, once again, [ported it to] the Sega Master System. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 However, Hudson decided [to] release a version [of] the game for their own console, the P.C. Engine. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Once again, they completely changed the characters [and] the name and released it as "Bikkuriman World". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 If that wasn't odd enough, the Brazilian video game company, Tec Toy, released a substantially [re]worked version of the game in Brazil as "Mônica no Castelo do Dragão". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, finally, Jaleco released an unau... unauthorized and completely blatant rip-off of the game, called "Saiyūki World". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Strangely enough, the sequel, "Saiyūki World 2", (which was not based on any 'Wonder Boy' game), was completely re-worked and released in the United States as "Whomp 'Em". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next up, was the Arcade game from Sega, "Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Sega decided [to] port this to their new home console, the Mega Drive (known in the U.S. as the Genesis) as "Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair". 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hudson decided to [release] this game on the P.C. Engine, uh, once again, as a straight port, "Wonder Boy III...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, in the U.S. (on the U.S. version of the P.C. Engine, known as the T... TurboGrafx-16), they dropped 'Wonder Boy' and called it simply, “Monster Lair”. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, it starts [to] get a little confusing. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Sega had released the first two 'Wonder Boy' games for the Sega Master System, but not the newest one, "Wonder Boy III...". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, they came [up with] another game, called "Wonder Boy III: Dragon's Trap", which is a completely different game than "Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This was released directly to the Se... Sega Master System. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, Hudson Soft wanted versions of these games, as well. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 So, once again, they dropped “Wonder Boy” and released the game on the TurboGrafx-16 as “Dragon's Curse” and (if you can believe this) on the P.C. Engine as “Adventure Island”. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, this “Adventure Island” has nothing [to do] {at} all with the series of games that came out on the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 The next 'Wonder Boy' game was released directly [to] the Sega Mega Drive. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Now, ya might think [it] would be called “Wonder Boy IV”, but rather Sega decided [to] call it “Wonder Boy V: Monster World III”! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This came out on the U.S. version [of] the Mega Drive, the Sega Genesis, with a simplified title, “Wonder Boy in Monster World”. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, of course, Hudson also ported the game [to] the P.C. Engine, calling it “Dynastic Hero”. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, finally, Sega came out with one last sequel. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, [in] this game, they *themselves* dropped 'Wonder Boy', and the game was simply called “Monster World IV”. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of course, while [they] were releasing their own versions of the 'Wonder Boy' games [to] the P.C. Engine, Hudson was also coming up with more 'Adventure Island' games for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 1991 saw “Adventure Island II”. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Next up, for the brand new Super Nintendo (or Super FamiCom) system, they released “Super Adventure Island”. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 After that, it was back [to] the FamiCom for “Adventure Island III”. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 And, in the middle of all this, Hudson [decided to release] an 'Adventure Island' game for the P.C. Engine and TurboGrafx-16, called “New Adventure Island”. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Finally, in 1994, Hudson releases the Japan-[only] “Takahashi Meijin no Bouken Jima IV”. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And the following year, the whole thing comes to a close with the release of "Super Adventure Island II" for the Super FamiCom and Super N.E.S.. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Hopefully, everyone was able [to] follow all of that. 🍇🍌


👓🏮🍊🎇# Adventure Island (Review Resumes) ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, let's take a look [at] the actual game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 For the U.S. version, the character was renamed 'Master Higgins', which seems sort of inappropriate for a guy wearing a grass skirt [and] living in the jungle. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 [However] this game is certainly [filled] with those sorts of little anachronistic touches, [such as] using a skateboard as a means of transportation. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Adventure Island" seems very much indebted [to] "Super Mario Bros.". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You travel through a series of worlds, each [consisting] of exactly four levels, and at the end of each world, you meet the same rather easy Boss. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 It's a simple matter to avoid this guy's projectiles [and] hit him on the head with your stone hammer. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Throughout the game, Master Higgins encounters, you know, the usual moving platforms, deadly drops, and jumping enemies. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 However, while "Super Mario Bros." is relatively flat, "Adventure Island" contains a lot of hills and valleys. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 You're often moving up or down at the same time you're [moving] from side [to] side in this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 It's also somewhat harder than "Super Mario Bros.", [and] part of this [is] due [to] your constantly [diminishing] Life Bar, which is filled up by grabbing the fruits that appear, which [are] usually floating in the air. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 This is not usually a problem, but there are areas where fruit's [pretty] scarce [and] you'll need to advance very quickly while grabbing all [the] fruit [that you] can. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And quite a bit of precision jumping is required for this game. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 "Adventure Island" is hardly perfect; the levels do get a r... -- bit repetitive after a while. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 But, compared to the other post-"...Mario..." Platformers we've been seeing (such as "Atlantis no Nazo", "Musashi no Ken", [and] "[Super] Pitfall") it's very refreshing [to] play a high-quality game, [such as] this one. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 When ya factor in "Adventure Island"'s very nice graphics, usable controls, and generally very playable level design, [ya will] see [this] is probably the best, uh, "...Mario Bros."-esque Platform[er] we've had, since, "Super Mario Bros." itself! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 Of all the games we're playing this episode, this [is] the one that stands out the most, in terms of quality, so it's definitely, uh, something ya [wanna] check out. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 King's Knight 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 18 🇯🇵 // 1989 September [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Bits Laboratory
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Square 🇯🇵 // Squaresoft 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, here's, sort of, a strange one, "King's Knight". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] if [you] were [to] look [at] the cover of this and notice that it's by Square, ya might think, 'Wow! This is, like, an early R.P.G. from Square or something!'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, once you actually start playing it, you will find it's basically a Shoot-'em-Up! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Granted, it's a very odd Shoot-'em-Up! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is, sort of, in the, uh, R.P.G.-style Shoot-'em-Up, as in, uh, "Galg", [only] this one is probably a bit more easier [to] understand. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The game is actually reasonably simple. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "King's Knight" was actually developed by Bits Laboratory - the same guys [who] did "Bokosuka Wars". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And just like that earlier game, "King's Knight" is a little strange. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There really isn't anything else like it. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You cruise through levels, blowing up anything that stands in your way [and] looking [for various] items - um, for example, those special Runic symbols there (like the little dot with the d... -- other dots around it). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya [need to] pick up those and along the way, also try [to] get items that [will] actually, [sort of], Level Up your character. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, things [that'll] make you faster, give ya better shields... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As {ya} see, I'm, uh, Level 7 after completing this. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Then you do exactly the same thing [with] the next character, which is a wizard. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, you will actually uncover a little dungeon area, such as this one, right here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Again, you can just sort of pick up some more power-ups while you're down here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Altogether, there's four characters and, uh, they [have] rather strange names. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 There was the Knight, Ray Jack, this wizard is Kaliva; also, there's the monster, Barusa, and Toby the thief. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 As you can see, you actually have a Life Meter which gets drained [pretty] quickly whenever ya get hit by enemy fire. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, there's those little arrows. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... Hitting an up arrow will give you a [little bit] of your health back. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Hitting a down arrow will *lower* your health. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unfortunately (especially in the, uh, last three characters), there's a *lot* more *down* arrows than there are *up* arrows. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As a result, you can sometimes find yourself, sort of, getting trapped, where you're, sort of, stuck [to] go over a down arrow [and] lower your health. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, how does "King's Knight" fare strictly as a Shoot-'em-Up? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, really not very good. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Your character has [pretty] limited mobility because of all the little islands, and mountains, and trees, and whatnot. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can blow your way through those, but [it] takes a while. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Also, you don't really seem [to] get much along the lines of power-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, in terms of just, sort of, Shoot-'em-Up playability, yeah, this is not very good. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, once you've gotten all four of your characters, uh, Leveled Up properly, you then go on [to] this final level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this case, three of my characters actually died, so I [only] have one (the wizard) left. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... [No] matter how powerful your characters are, I think you actually [need] all four characters [to] get through this level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If there's one nice thing about this game, it's [that] if ya didn't really do that well [with] certain characters, you [can] actually go back [and] keep playing them [until] ya get them Leveled Up the way you want them. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, if a character has died, you can make another attempt. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, while "King's Knight" is an interesting idea, it never really kind of comes together as a game and certainly not really indicative of the kind of quality games that Square would release much later. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Koneko Monogatari: The Adventures of Chatran 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 19 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Marionette | SRS
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Pony Canyon 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, [only] two weeks after "Super Pitfall", Pony Canyon releases its first F.D.S. game, "Koneko Monogatari: The Adventures of Chatran". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The title means literally 'Kitten Story', and this video game is based off the movie of the same name. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This film [was released] in the U.S. as "The Adventures of Milo and Otis" - basically about a cute little cat and puppy that journey across the countryside, looking for their home... or something like that. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This is actually Pony Canyon's *second* game about a [little] *kitten* (the first being "Onyanko Town" from back in, uh, 1985). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is certainly more fun [than] that game, and it's, uh, not nearly [as] offensive as "Super Pitfall", either. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game might be intended for kids; [it's] a [pretty] simple Platformer [in which] you, sort of, walk around, jump, {and} avoid enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {It's} nothing to get too excited about, but it's hardly a bad game either. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You collect apples; I'm not really sure why ([probably] they have some [sort of] use later in the game) as well [as] the occasional egg. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can also drop the apples on top of the mice, which will kill them. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The graphics are reasonably cute, and the controls [are] actually [pretty] good. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This was developed by, [like], um -- or rather co-developed by companies called Marionette and SDS, about which I *really* don't know *anything*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I don't think that either [of] them ever [went] on [to] do anything, uh, interesting or s... -- or very notable. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, *[aside]* from apples, you also collect eggs - and there are a few, sort of, like, power-up-like items. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, [collecting] a bottle of *milk* will give you temporary invincibility. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [And] you [can] just plow through enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Otherwise, you have no offensive capabilities [in] this game, other than dropping an apple on their head. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *Occasionally*, you will come [across] an egg with a letter on it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 For example, this one says 'E'. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you collect, uh, all four letters [to] spell 'HELP', *Otis* will appear. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He will run in [front] of you and, uh, destroy [the] enemies [that] he happens [to] hit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {You} have to be careful, though, because if he touches you, he will kill you as well. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Here's the end of Scene 2. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 {I'm} not really sure how many levels there are [in] this game; I didn't play it all the way through. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Some take place during the day; some take place at night. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I don't know [that] this game ever really, sort of, follows the script [of] the film. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I think it more or less just, sort of, uses the character, ehh, in a [pretty] much generic little Platformer. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Maybe the cutest part is when Milo has to cross a lake or something in a little box! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Of course, a single drop of rain will kill him, for some reason, and, uh, not to mention the, uh, rather high-flying fish. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Now], isn't it really cute when he puts his head down [and] -- and has to, uh, duck and hide [from] enemies? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [That's just] really adorable. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If nothing else, "...The Adventures of Chatran" is cute, reasonably playable, and really not that bad of a Platformer. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Super Xevious: Gamp no Nazo 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 19 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Tose
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Namco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 We have another Namco title here, "Super Xevious". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And this is obviously a sequel to their Arcade game, "Xevious". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though this particular version of "Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo" is actually, uh, [an] original for the FamiCom. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game should not be confused with the Arcade "Super Xevious", which is basically just a slightly reworked version of the original "Xevious". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Something [to] note: This game was not designed by Masanobu Endô. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 He had actually left Namco, at this time, to start his own company. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game looks, plays, and sounds an awful lot like the original "Xevious"; however, there are some differences. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And you'll actually see the first one coming up here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... I noticed some [of] the enemies [and] whatnot are new. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 The actual layouts look quite similar. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... The game [pretty] much plays the same; ya have the bomb, ya have the laser,... 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, once you get, uh, to a certain point on this first level, here, you'll notice something - which is you actually start going past areas you've already passed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 In fact, we'll [notice] here that we've come across some stuff that's already been bombed. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [This is] actually the very beginning of the game, right here. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Something, uh, "Super Xevious" does is each level [will pretty] much loop infinitely, unless you figure [out] how to leave the level. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There's, sort of, a, uh, little riddle built into each level (which is usually something completely random). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this case, you have [to] actually fly through a [particular] cloud. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then suddenly, you'll be on the second level. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This [can] make, uh, the game, I suppose, either (oh, I don't know) a bit less enjoyable or... a bit more fun {to} try to figure out all the puzzles; I guess it's really -- sorta depends on your state of mind. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Something else [that's] been added to the game is power-ups. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, this little ship will fly by; shoot him, and he'll spit out three balls. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Depending on which color ya grab, you'll get a certain power-up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In this case, I [grabbed] the extra-wide bomb sites. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah! Here's the, uh, one [of] the first Bosses. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya have to shoot him right in the middle, [and] then you [can] actually fly [into] him. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the next level takes place *inside* the Boss. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Again, this level will loop you around infinitely unless you've, uh -- have to destroy certain objects on the ground in order to -- [to] get [out] of it. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, this gives a bit of [variety] to "Xevious". 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the gameplay is still basically the same... but, at least, there's sort of, uh, different kinds of backgrounds. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Ah. Now, we exit the ship, and we're back on the ground. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This level could be a bit tricky because you can't always see everything; [sometimes] enemies are hidden in the bushes. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And [this] game actually does get, sort of, hard near the end ([I mean], so than the original "Xevious"). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Uh... This, uh, especially becomes true around the level where ya have [to] go through underground tunnels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And I will admit, I was -- actually, I had not gotten through this level at the time I had made this video. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, how [do] we feel about "Super Xevious"? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, I guess, depending on your viewpoint, it [could either] be a slightly improved version of the original game - or it could be a classic that was kind of screwed up by adding a bunch of unnecessary elements. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Either way, it's worth giving it a look. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Ghostbusters 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 22 🇯🇵 // 1988 October [?] 🇺🇸
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Activision | Bits Laboratory
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Tokuma Shoten 🇯🇵 // Activision 🇺🇸 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And it's "Ghostbusters" - a port of Activision's N... -- Commodore 64 game, based on the *movie*. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And listen to this. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Ghostbusters!* 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Yeah, isn't *that* nice. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Well, this is a weird little game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Um... As I mentioned, it was based on [an] American Computer Game, which came out in 1984. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, even though it doesn't really seem like it, the basic structure is *kind* of similar to an R.P.G.. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [Ya] need to start by buying some equipment, and then you go around sucking up ghosts! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The main object of [the] game is to make enough money [to] buy the equipment [necessary] {to} take on the big ghost [at] the end. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, in order to actually get from place [to] place, you have [to] drive there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've *arrived*, you [can] then buy some items; [and in] order [to] capture ghosts, you'll need a Capture Beam and, uh, something [to] keep them in. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I prefer the Super Trap because you [can] keep {an} unlimited number of ghosts in there. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Then you find a place [that's] haunted, drive there again, and deal with the ghosts. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then you just repeat this until the Boss ghost, Gozer, shows up. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [We seem to] look more like army guys than Ghostbusters. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Use your little, uh, proton beams, there, [to] grab ahold [of] the ghosts - and then, once [you've] got 'em all, suck 'em into the ghost trap. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Ya get some cash for this - and really ya wanna try [to] get all four ghosts [into] the ghost trap at the same time because you'll get the most *cash* that way. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Then you wander around, find the next villa that's haunted, {and} so on {and} so forth. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You can also buy a Ghost Alarm that makes it easier [to] find which buildings are haunted. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, as it happens, the original Commodore game was designed by David Crane, who was a [pretty] well-known game designer back in the day, for Atari and then later for Activision (probably most well-known for, of all things, the 'Pitfall!' games). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As it turns out, this game was *not* originally intended to be a *'Ghostbusters'* game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It was *originally* a project called *"Car Wars"*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Apparently, at some point, Activision got the license [to] "Ghostbusters", so they did some work and converted it very quickly into the "Ghostbusters" game ya see here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 That might have something [to] do with the reason why this game is really not that good. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 "Ghostbusters" seems [to belong to] the old-school design theory that you can make a bigger game simply by taking several smaller games [and], sort of, joining them [together]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 "Ghostbusters" has some very basic, uh, Inventory Management-type stuff; it has a very simple Driving Game, and has a very simple Action Game where [ya] try [to] capture the ghosts. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But the problem is - individually, none [of] these sections really work. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The Driving Game is not at all exciting; the sections where ya have to catch ghosts is boring [and] repetitive - and there's really no reason why you can't catch four [at] a time (unless the ghosts don't stray low [enough to] get caught by your beams). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 In 1984, [you] could probably still get away with this kind of game, to a certain extent, but in *1986 not* so *much*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 After things like *"Metroid"* had come out, what really was the *point* of a game like this? 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And, believe it or not, this was released for the Nintendo in the United States in *1988*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This must have seemed like a Relic from another era! 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If "Ghostbusters" were just a little dull, that would be one thing, but it *actually* gets worse from here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Once you've got enough money (you can buy the correct items), you [can] go face Gozer himself in the middle of the, uh, main -- main screen. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Then, of course, [we] get to one of the all-time worst video game levels. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is almost certainly the worst thing we've ever seen for the FamiCom, so far. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 At this point, [ya need] to climb up several flights of stairs, in order to get to the top and fight Gozer. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 However, you move by hitting your A button. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Hitting the A button will let you take *one single* step. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 That's right, you don't use the *D-Pad* {to} move around; ya have to hit the A button *repeatedly* to slowly, slowly, *slowly* march across [the] floor [and] up the stairs. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 All the while, you're being harassed by ghosts. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Keep in mind that you're so incredibly slow-moving, you have [pretty] much zero maneuverability - [so] the ghosts [can pretty] much come [down and] hit you whenever they [want]. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You can buy some items [that] make this level a [little bit] easier, but there's no way this could possibly be anything but completely *annoying*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 *Seriously* the *completely* bidz... -- bizarre *control scheme* almost really *ruins* the entire game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [I] mean, you [can] play the *first* part all ya want, and it's really not *that* bad. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But once you get to this, you *really* don't wanna continue playing. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Probably, [only] curiosity [to] see the final level is what would actually cause anyone [to] keep on playing through this thing [until] they got all the way [to] the top. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 After you die, even the game admits that it's, sort of, {a} matter of, uh -- of luck more [than] anything else. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 So, "Ghostbusters" basically boils down [to] being a mediocre game with a really terrible final level added on the end. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 However, this game must have sold *well*; it was ported to *lots* of different *systems*! 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 I can [only] assume this [is] based *solely* on the popularity [of] the *movie*. 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🎮 Space Hunter 🇯🇵 ✨

🎧🏮🍊♪ "Tin Cans (Puerto Rican Remix)" ♪ by Tortoise

👓🏮🥭🗓️ Released 1986 September 25 🇯🇵
👓🏮🍒💾 Developed by Kemco
👓🏮🍒📦 Published by Kemco 🇯🇵 🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Our last game {in} this episode is another disappointing one. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's "Space Hunter" from *Kemco* (which so far has released some consistently mediocre games). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 Now, the weird thing about this game is it, sort of, resembles "Metroid" in, like, a -- a weird way (maybe, like, an extremely *bad* version of "Metroid") in the sense [that] you are some, uh, female Space Hunter (which is actually what Samus Aran was originally called, in the "Metroid" manual - a 'Space Hunter') who, uh, runs around this weird planet, um, dealing with aliens and looking for something. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 This game is *completely* in Japanese, so it's, sort of, difficult for a -- a Westerner to really know what's going on here. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But there [are] several planets you can visit. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Apparently, aliens are attacking Earth. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can, sort of], see the little missiles heading towards Earth (or whatever planet [that] is in the opening screen, there). 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And you're this female character and (well, you get killed a lot, first of all, but, um) you choose the planet [that] you want [to] go to. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And then, while you're there, there's all these little, uh, rooms you [can] enter. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And the game is, sort of, like, a cross between "Metroid" and "Bomberman", [only], of course, it's not very good. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 You [can] lay bombs which will explode, uh, [only] horizontally (at least at first). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Unlike "Metroid", however, there's no scrolling in-between screens. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Since your character is, *sort of*, hard to control, ya *often* find yourself accidentally hitting the edge of the screen ([and] thus going into a *new screen*). 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This makes the game even more annoying. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 The *screen* is *[needlessly] cluttered up* by that blue border, and then the interface [that] shows you things like your *password*. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Wh... -- Why would [ya need to] see [that] *all the time*? 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 So, anyway, ya use your, sort of, little *rocket thing* you're sitting on to propel around these little *space dungeons*, avoiding the enemies. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Occasionally, you can blow them up using your little *"Bomberman"-like bombs* there. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Though it's, uh... ([since] the bombs [only] go horizontally and not vertically) ...it's rather difficult. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 If you enter these dungeons, you have [to] kill off [a] couple enemies (again, quite difficult because the explosions don't go past maze walls), pick up little items, and, uh, once ya defeat them, you'll get what appears [to] be some sort of clue or Quest Item. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 You can also pick up other weapons, occasionally - but they -- they seem [to] run [out] of energy r... -- reasonably quickly. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 Despite the fact that there are six different planets and one looks fiery, and one looks icy, and so on, there's not really much [of] a difference [between them]. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 [The only] thing is sort of, the, uh, color and the texture of the bricks. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But *really*, the design [of] this game has *[pretty]* much zero character. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 On this screen, right here, ya [can] switch weapons. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is, sort of, a Wave Beam-type gun. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 It's easier [to] kill enemies, but it runs out of juice really quick. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 As you [can see], the power is going down, but, uh, it actually disappeared long [before] the power ran out. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 And part [of] the issue, of course, is, ya know, I -- I don't know, really, how [to] *play* this game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 But, regardless, from what I've seen, there's *no* way this could possibly be a good game. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And, *quite frankly*, it doesn't really seem [to be] -- be well-remembered (even in Japan), as far as I [can] tell. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 There [are] a lot of, sort of, like, hidden Japanese classics for the FamiCom. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This game would definitely not fall in that category. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 This is, sort of, one [of] those very minor games, which is *really* better left unplayed. 🍇🍌


✅🍪🍊🍓 *However*, *one day after* this game was released, *Konami* released one [of] their all-time classic games. 🍇

✅🍪🍊🍓 And we'll be taking a look at *that* one at the beginning of {the} next episode! 🍇🍌



👓🏮🍊🎇# 🥇 Episode 10 Wrap Up ✨


✅🏮🍊🍓 Well, another 15 games *down*, and we'll do 15 more again, *next time*! 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 How [did] this episode fare, in terms of ninjas [and] *Shoot-'em-Ups*? 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 *Well*, obviously, "Jajamaru no Daibouken" had some ninjas in *it*! 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, uh, "Musashi no Ken", I think, was actually ninja-less, even though it certainly felt like it could have used *some*. 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 There were some little pink guys jumping around, who (I thought) *resembled* ninjas, but may have actually been guys in pink *Kendo* outfits. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 In terms of *Shoot-'em-Ups*, there was certainly "ASO" and "[Super] *Xevious*". 🍇

✅🏮🍊🍓 And, I suppose, also "King's Knight" and "Sky Kid" are, sort of, unusual Shoot-'em-Ups. 🍇🍌


✅🏮🍊🍓 So, join us next episode, where we'll see Konami unleash one [of] their [popular] *franchises* and also some [pretty] cool titles from Capcom and *Hudson*! 🍇🍌
